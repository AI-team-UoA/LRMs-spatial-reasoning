PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z is determined by the fact that EQ(y,z) implies y and z are identical regions. Therefore, the spatial relation between x and y directly applies to x and z.

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary).
- Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) would imply no shared interior or only boundary contact, but x is inside z.
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap without one being part of the other, but x is a proper part of z.
- TPP(x,z) would require x to touch z's boundary, but NTPP specifies no boundary contact.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is part of x, which is not possible since x is a proper part of z.
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but x is a proper part of z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).
