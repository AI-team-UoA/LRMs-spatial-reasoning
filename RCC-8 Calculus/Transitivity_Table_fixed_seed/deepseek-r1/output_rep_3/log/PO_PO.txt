PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are all RCC-8 relations except EQ(x,z), as equality is incompatible with the partial overlap relations. Specifically, the possible relations are:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).

These possibilities arise from the various spatial configurations that satisfy the given conditions, such as regions being disjoint, touching, overlapping, or one being contained within the other, while maintaining the partial overlaps with y.

DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi
