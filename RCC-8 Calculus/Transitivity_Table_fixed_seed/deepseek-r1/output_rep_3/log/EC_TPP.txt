PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning:

- EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected, sharing a boundary but no interior parts.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected if x is outside z but touches it at the boundary point shared with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if x shares some interior with z but neither is part of the other, which can occur when x overlaps z and touches y at any boundary point.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary (e.g., through the connection with y at a boundary point).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within z, does not touch z's boundary, and connects with y at a point not on z's boundary.

Relations such as DC(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because:
- DC is excluded since x and z share a connection point through y.
- EQ is impossible as x and z cannot be coincident given the distinct relationships with y.
- TPPi and NTPPi imply z is part of x, contradicting EC(x,y) where y cannot be part of x.

Thus, the possible relationships are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
