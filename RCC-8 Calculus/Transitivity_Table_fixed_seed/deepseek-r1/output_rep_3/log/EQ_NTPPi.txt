PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are spatially identical. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), indicating that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is entirely contained within y, does not touch y's boundary, and is not equal to y).

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), the relationship between y and z directly applies to x and z. Therefore, NTPP(z,y) implies NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

This means that for x and z, z is a non-tangential proper part of x. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP (direct), TPPi, and EQ are excluded because z is strictly and entirely inside x without touching the boundary, and x and z are not equal.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
