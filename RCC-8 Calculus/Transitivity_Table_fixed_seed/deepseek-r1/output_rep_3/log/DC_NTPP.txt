PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. Since y is entirely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x is disconnected from y, x could be entirely outside z, leading to DC(x,z).
- **EC(x,z)**: x touches z externally. Even though y is inside z (without touching its boundary), x could touch z's boundary without overlapping y, so EC(x,z) is possible.
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps z. Since y is inside z but x is disconnected from y, x could partially overlap z in a region not occupied by y, so PO(x,z) is possible.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z (touching z's boundary) without overlapping y, satisfying DC(x,y).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z (not touching the boundary) and avoid overlapping y, so NTPP(x,z) is possible.

The relations EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would imply x and z are identical, but then y inside z would overlap x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Would imply z is inside x, so y (inside z) would overlap x, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
