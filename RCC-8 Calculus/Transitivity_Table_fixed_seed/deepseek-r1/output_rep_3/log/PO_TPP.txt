PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs if there is a part of x outside z. Since PO(x,y) implies part of x is outside y, and TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, if the part of x outside y extends outside z, then x and z partially overlap without one being part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part occurs if x is entirely contained in z (so part of x outside y is still inside z) and x touches the boundary of z. This can happen if the boundary touch of y with z is shared with x or if x independently touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part occurs if x is entirely contained in z (part of x outside y is inside z) and x does not touch the boundary of z, lying entirely in the interior.

These possibilities arise because:
- PO(x,y) ensures x and y share interior parts but neither is contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z) ensures y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- The interaction allows x to either extend beyond z (PO), be inside z and touch its boundary (TPP), or be strictly inside z (NTPP).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
