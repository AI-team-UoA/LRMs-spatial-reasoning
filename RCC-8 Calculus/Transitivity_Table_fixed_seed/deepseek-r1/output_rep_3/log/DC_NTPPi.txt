PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- NTPPi(y, z): equivalent to NTPP(z, y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary).

To determine the possible relationships between x and z:
- Since DC(x, y) holds, x and y have no common points (interior or boundary).
- Since NTPP(z, y) holds, z is entirely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Because z is completely inside y and x is completely outside y (due to DC(x, y)), x and z cannot share any spatial points. Therefore:
- They cannot be externally connected (EC), as that requires touching at a boundary.
- They cannot partially overlap (PO), as that requires sharing an interior part.
- x cannot be a tangential or non-tangential proper part of z (or vice versa), as z is inside y and x is outside y.
- They cannot be equal (EQ).

The only possible relation is DC(x, z), meaning x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This is consistent with the RCC-8 composition table, where the composition of DC and NTPP (or NTPPi) results in DC.

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x, z).
