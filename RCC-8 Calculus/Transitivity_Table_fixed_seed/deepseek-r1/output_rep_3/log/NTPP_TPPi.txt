PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y without touching y's boundary).
- TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y (z is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary).

Considering the spatial constraints:
- Both x and z are inside y.
- x does not touch y's boundary, while z does.
- x and z can be arranged in various ways relative to each other within y.

Possible relations:
1. **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected (no shared points). Example: x is a small circle deep inside y, and z is a small circle touching y's boundary but not overlapping or touching x.
2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally (share boundary points but no interior). Example: x and z are adjacent circles inside y, touching at a point but not overlapping interiors.
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (share interior and boundary points, but neither contains the other). Example: x and z overlap partially inside y.
4. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). Example: z is a larger circle touching y's boundary, and x is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary.
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z without touching z's boundary). Example: z is a circle touching y's boundary, and x is a smaller circle entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Impossible relations:
- **TPPi(x,z)** (or TPP(z,x)): z cannot be inside x because z touches y's boundary, which would force x to touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y).
- **NTPPi(x,z)** (or NTPP(z,x)): Similarly impossible for the same reason.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be equal because x does not touch y's boundary while z does.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
