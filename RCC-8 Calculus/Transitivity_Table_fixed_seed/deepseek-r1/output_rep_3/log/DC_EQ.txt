PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected with no shared parts, and EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions), the spatial relationship between x and z must mirror that between x and y. Since y and z are the same region, x and z cannot share any parts. Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
