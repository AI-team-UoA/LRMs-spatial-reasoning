PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. This implies that x and z are both entirely contained within the interior of y, not touching its boundary. The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are all eight relations, as there are no restrictions preventing any of them:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no parts.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch externally but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither is a proper part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (touching z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (not touching z's boundary).
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal (coincident regions).

Thus, all RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z.
