PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the RCC-8 composition table for 2D space, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).

NTPP and NTPPi are not possible because non-tangential proper parthood would imply that x (or z) is entirely contained within z (or x) without touching the boundary, which contradicts the external connection constraints (EC requires boundary contact and disjoint interiors).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi
