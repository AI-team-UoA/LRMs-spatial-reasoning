PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region. Therefore, any relation involving y can be directly substituted with x. Since PO(y,z) holds, this becomes PO(x,z).  

PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap: they share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other, and they are not equal. This is consistent because:  
- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are identical.  
- PO(y,z) implies y and z partially overlap, so substituting x for y gives PO(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) would require no shared interior parts, contradicting PO.  
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) would imply one is a proper part of the other, which PO forbids.  
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but PO(y,z) explicitly denies equality.  

Thus, the only possible relation is PO(x,z).  

### Answer: PO(x,z)
