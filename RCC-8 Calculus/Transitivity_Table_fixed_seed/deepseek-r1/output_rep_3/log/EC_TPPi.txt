PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if the boundary contact between x and y does not involve the part of y's boundary where z is located. Since z is a tangential proper part of y (touching y's boundary), it may not interact with x, leading to no connection.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if z is located at the boundary region where x and y touch. Since z touches y's boundary and x touches that same boundary region, x and z may share a boundary point without overlapping interiors.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be coincident because x is outside y (due to EC(x,y)) while z is inside y (due to TPP(z,y)).
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is impossible because x and y share no interior (EC(x,y)), and z is entirely within y, so x and z cannot share interior parts.
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: These require one region to be a proper part of the other, but x is disjoint from y except at the boundary, while z is inside y, preventing any part-whole relationship between x and z.

Thus, only DC and EC are possible.
