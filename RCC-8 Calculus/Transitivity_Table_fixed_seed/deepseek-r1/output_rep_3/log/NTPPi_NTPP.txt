PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), which are equivalent to NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z), we deduce the possible relations between x and z.

- NTPP(y,x) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x without touching its boundary).
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z without touching its boundary).

The spatial arrangement of y inside both x and z implies that x and z must share at least the region occupied by y. Therefore, they cannot be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC), as these require no shared interior parts.

The possible relations between x and z are:
1. **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are equal. This is possible because y can be inside both without contradiction.
2. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if they share y and have additional parts outside each other, without violating the non-tangential conditions.
3. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). This is consistent as y can be in the interior of x, away from the boundary.
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). Similarly, y can be inside z, away from the boundaries.
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z without touching its boundary). This is consistent with the nesting.
6. **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x without touching its boundary). This is also consistent.

Thus, the possible relations are EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, and NTPPi.

### Answer: EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi
