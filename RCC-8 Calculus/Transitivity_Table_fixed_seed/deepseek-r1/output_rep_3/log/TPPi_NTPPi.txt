PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the relations can be interpreted as follows:  
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is part of x and touches the boundary of x.  
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This implies that z is part of y and does not touch the boundary of y.  

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be part of x. The key point is that z does not touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x. Because z is strictly interior to y (not touching y's boundary) and y is contained within x (touching x's boundary), z is entirely within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  

The relation NTPP(z,x) corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) in the RCC-8 calculus. Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) are excluded because z shares parts with x.  
- PO(x,z) is excluded because z is a proper part of x, so neither can be part of the other.  
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, which is impossible since z is part of y and y is a proper part of x.  
- TPPi(x,z) would imply z is a tangential proper part of x, but z does not touch x's boundary.  
- EQ(x,z) is excluded because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so x and z cannot be equal.  

Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).
