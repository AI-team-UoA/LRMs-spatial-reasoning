PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus.  

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.  
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither is a proper part of the other.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)), meaning z is part of x and touches x's boundary.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x)), meaning z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.  

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:  
- If x were a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP), the point where x and y touch would be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).  
- EQ(x,z) would imply EC(x,y) and DC(x,z), but DC(x,x) is false.  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
