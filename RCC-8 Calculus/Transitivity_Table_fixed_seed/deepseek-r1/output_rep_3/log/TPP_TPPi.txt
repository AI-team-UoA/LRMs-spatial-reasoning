PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which implies TPP(z,y) since TPPi is the inverse, both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This means x and z are both parts of y and each touches y's boundary directly.

The possible relations between x and z are constrained because both must satisfy their tangential connection to y. After considering the composition of the relations and the properties of RCC-8, the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, both touching y's boundary but not each other.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if x and z are adjacent and touch each other's boundaries, while both remain tangential to y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a part of the other. This is possible if the regions overlap in a way that both still touch y's boundary.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (the same region). This is possible if x and z refer to the identical region that is a tangential proper part of y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z contains x, and x touches z's boundary at a point that also lies on y's boundary (to satisfy TPP(x,y)).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP). This is possible if x contains z, and z touches x's boundary at a point that also lies on y's boundary (to satisfy TPP(z,y)).

The relations NTPP and NTPPi are not possible because:
- If NTPP(x,z), x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x does not touch z's boundary. However, since z touches y's boundary and x is inside z, x cannot touch y's boundary directly, contradicting TPP(x,y).
- Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) would imply z is a non-tangential proper part of x, preventing z from touching y's boundary directly, contradicting TPP(z,y).

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, and TPPi.
