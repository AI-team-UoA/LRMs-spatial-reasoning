PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we derive the relations:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This implies z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be part of x. Specifically:
- Because y is non-tangential to x (no boundary contact), and z is tangential to y (touching y's boundary), z cannot touch x's boundary due to the "buffer" region between y and x's boundary.
- Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x).

For the relationship between x and z, NTPP(z,x) corresponds to NTPPi(x,z). This is the only possible relation, as other RCC-8 relations are inconsistent:
- DC or EC: Not possible, as x and z share spatial parts.
- PO: Not possible, as z is entirely within x.
- TPP or TPPi: Not possible, as z does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ: Not possible, as z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so x and z cannot be equal.
- NTPP: This would imply z is a non-tangential proper part of x from z to x, but we have it from x to z as NTPPi.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
