PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is part of x and touches the boundary of x. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is part of z and does not touch the boundary of z.

The composition of TPPi and NTPP results in three possible relations for x and z:
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z and does not touch its boundary.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is contained within z and touches the boundary of z, but y must not touch the part of x's boundary that coincides with z's boundary to avoid contradiction with NTPP(y,z).
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps z, meaning they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other, with the point where y touches x's boundary being interior to z.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC and EC are excluded because x and z share y, which has an interior.
- EQ is excluded because it would imply x and z are coincident, but y touches x's boundary while not touching z's boundary, leading to contradiction.
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are excluded because z cannot be a proper part of x, as this would prevent y from touching x's boundary while satisfying NTPP(y,z).

Thus, the possible relationships are NTPP(x,z), TPP(x,z), and PO(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z), TPP(x,z), PO(x,z)
