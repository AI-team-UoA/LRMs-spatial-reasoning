PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be EC(x,z).

- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical regions.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y are externally connected; they share boundary points but no interior points.
- Since z is identical to y, the relation between x and z is the same as between x and y, resulting in EC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) would imply disconnection, but EC requires connection.
- PO(x,z) would imply interior point sharing, which EC forbids.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) would imply that one is a proper part of the other, but EC implies that x and y (and thus x and z) are distinct and not part of each other.
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are identical, but EC(x,y) with distinct x and y contradicts this.

Thus, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).
