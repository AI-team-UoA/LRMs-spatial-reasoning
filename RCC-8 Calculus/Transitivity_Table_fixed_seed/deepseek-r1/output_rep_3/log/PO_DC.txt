PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the constraints of the RCC-8 calculus. PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a proper part of the other. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if the part of x not overlapping with y is not near z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This occurs if the part of x not overlapping with y touches z but does not share interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs if the part of x not overlapping with y shares some spatial parts with z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is part of x and touches x's boundary, but y remains disconnected from z.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is part of x and does not touch x's boundary, with y disconnected from z.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, leading to a contradiction because PO(x,y) implies x and y share parts, so z and y would share parts, violating DC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical, but PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) cannot both hold if x and z are the same, as it would imply PO(y,z) and DC(y,z), a contradiction.

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
