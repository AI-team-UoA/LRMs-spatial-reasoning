{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Based on the RCC-8 composition table for 2D space, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:\n\n- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.\n- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected.\n- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.\n- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal).\n- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.\n- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).\n\nNTPP and NTPPi are not possible because non-tangential proper parthood would imply that x (or z) is entirely contained within z (or x) without touching the boundary, which contradicts the external connection constraints (EC requires boundary contact and disjoint interiors).\n\n### Answer: DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi", "elapsed-time": 77.43673968315125, "reasoning-tokens": 2052, "completion-tokens": 2257}
