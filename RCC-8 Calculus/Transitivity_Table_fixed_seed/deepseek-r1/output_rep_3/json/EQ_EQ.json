{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), meaning x is coincident with y and y is coincident with z, by transitivity of spatial coincidence, x must be coincident with z. Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is EQ(x,z).  \n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 10.088357210159302, "reasoning-tokens": 169, "completion-tokens": 234}
