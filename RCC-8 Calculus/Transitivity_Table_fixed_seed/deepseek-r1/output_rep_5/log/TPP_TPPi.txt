PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which implies TPP(z,y), both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This means:
- x is part of y, x ≠ y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- z is part of y, z ≠ y, and z touches the boundary of y.

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are determined by their spatial configurations relative to each other while satisfying the conditions above. The relations NTPP and NTPPi are impossible because they would violate the boundary touching requirement for x or z with respect to y.

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are disjoint and share no common points (e.g., two separate regions inside y, both touching y's boundary but not each other).
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch externally but share no interior parts (e.g., two regions sharing a boundary point but no interior overlap, both touching y's boundary).
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other (e.g., two overlapping regions both touching y's boundary).
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (e.g., x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and this touching point aligns with y's boundary so x also touches y's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is inside x, touches x's boundary, and this touching point aligns with y's boundary so z also touches y's boundary; equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are the same region (e.g., x = z, satisfying both TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y)).

The relations NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible because:
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z without touching z's boundary, so x cannot touch y's boundary, contradicting TPP(x,y).
- Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)) would mean z is inside x without touching x's boundary, so z cannot touch y's boundary, contradicting TPP(z,y).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ
