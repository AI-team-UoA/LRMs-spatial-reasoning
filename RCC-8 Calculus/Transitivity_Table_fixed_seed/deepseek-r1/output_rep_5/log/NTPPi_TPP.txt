PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x, with no part of y touching the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. Thus, y is entirely contained within z, and y touches the boundary of z.

From these:
- y is inside both x and z, so x and z must overlap (share at least y).
- Since y touches the boundary of z, and y is entirely inside x, the boundary of z must lie within x's interior or coincide with part of x's boundary, but y itself does not touch x's boundary.
- z must be a proper part of x (i.e., z âŠ‚ x) because:
  - If x were a proper part of z, y touching z's boundary would imply y might touch x's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,x).
  - If x and z were partially overlapping (PO), disconnected (DC), externally connected (EC), or equal (EQ), contradictions arise due to y's position and boundary constraints.

Thus, z is a proper part of x. Two subcases are possible:
1. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z touches the boundary of x. This is consistent because y touches z's boundary (inside x) without touching x's boundary.
2. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Here, z does not touch the boundary of x. This is consistent because y touches z's boundary (which is in x's interior), and y does not touch x's boundary.

Other relations (DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, NTPP) are impossible due to the constraints on y's location and boundary contacts.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
