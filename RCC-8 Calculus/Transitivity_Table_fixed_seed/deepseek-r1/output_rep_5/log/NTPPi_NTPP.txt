PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely inside x without touching its boundary).
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z without touching its boundary).

The relationship between x and z must account for the shared region y, which is entirely contained within both x and z. The possible relations are derived from the RCC-8 composition table for NTPPi and NTPP:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible, as x and z may share more than just y but not be contained within each other.  
  Example: x and z partially overlap, with y in the shared interior.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).  
  Example: y is deep inside both, x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).  
  Example: y is deep inside both, z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident.  
  Example: x and z are the same region, both contain y internally.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is entirely inside z without touching its boundary).  
  Example: y is deep inside both, and x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is entirely inside x without touching its boundary).  
  Example: y is deep inside both, and z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary.

The relations DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected) are impossible because y ensures x and z share an interior part. Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ, NTPP, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ, NTPP, NTPPi
