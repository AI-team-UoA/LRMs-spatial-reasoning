PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 relations. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being a proper part of the other. TPP(z,y) indicates that z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: This is possible if x and y overlap in a region disjoint from z, resulting in x and z having no common points.
- **EC(x,z)**: This is possible if x and y overlap in an area adjacent to but not overlapping the interior of z, allowing x and z to touch only at a boundary without sharing interior points.
- **PO(x,z)**: This is possible if x and y overlap in a region that includes part of z, leading to x and z sharing interior points but neither being a proper part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x contains z and z touches x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x contains z and z does not touch x's boundary.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be coincident, but PO(x,y) implies x has parts outside y, while TPP(z,y) implies z is entirely within y, leading to a contradiction.
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but since z is a proper part of y, this would make x a part of y, contradicting PO(x,y) where x is not a part of y.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
