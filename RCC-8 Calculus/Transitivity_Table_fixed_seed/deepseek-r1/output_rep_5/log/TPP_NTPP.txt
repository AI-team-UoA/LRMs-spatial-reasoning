PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y: x is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is a non-tangential proper part of z: y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is entirely within y and y is entirely within z, x must be entirely within z. Additionally, because y does not touch z's boundary and x is contained within y, x cannot touch z's boundary. Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

This rules out other RCC-8 relations:
- DC, EC: x and z share spatial parts (x is inside z).
- PO: x is entirely within z (no partial overlap without containment).
- TPP: x would need to touch z's boundary, but x is contained within y, which is interior to z and does not touch the boundary.
- TPPi, NTPPi: z cannot be a proper part of x because x is contained within z.
- EQ: x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, so x cannot equal z.

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).
