PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This implies that x must be entirely contained within z without touching its boundary, meaning the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
