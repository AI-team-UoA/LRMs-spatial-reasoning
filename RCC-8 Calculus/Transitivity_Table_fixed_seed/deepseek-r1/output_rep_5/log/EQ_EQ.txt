PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) hold, this means that x is coincident with y, and y is coincident with z. By the transitivity of the EQ relation, x must also be coincident with z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is EQ(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi imply some form of spatial distinction (e.g., disconnection, partial overlap, or proper parthood), which contradicts the equality established by EQ.

Thus, the answer is EQ(x,z).

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
