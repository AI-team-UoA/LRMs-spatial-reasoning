PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are identical in spatial extent. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected and share no parts. Since x and y are identical, the relationship between x and z must be the same as that between y and z. Therefore, DC(x,z) must hold. No other RCC-8 relation is possible because:
- DC is the only relation consistent with no shared parts or connection.
- Other relations (EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) all imply some form of connection, overlap, or part-sharing, contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).
