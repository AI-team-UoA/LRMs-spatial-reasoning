PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- **EC(x,y)**: x and y touch at a boundary but have no interior overlap.  
- **TPP(z,y)**: z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.  

Since z is entirely within y (as a proper part) and x only contacts y at a boundary, the relation between x and z depends on whether they share a boundary point:  
1. **DC(x,z)**: If the boundary contact point between x and y is different from the boundary contact point between z and y, then x and z are disconnected and share no points.  
2. **EC(x,z)**: If the boundary contact point between x and y coincides with the boundary contact point between z and y, then x and z touch at that boundary point but have no interior overlap.  

Other relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are impossible because:  
- PO requires partial overlap of interiors, but x's interior is outside y while z's interior is inside y.  
- Part relations (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) would require one to contain the other, but x cannot contain z (since z is inside y and x is outside y), and z cannot contain x (since x is outside y).  
- EQ requires coincidence, which is inconsistent with the disjoint interiors.  

Thus, the possible relations are DC and EC.
