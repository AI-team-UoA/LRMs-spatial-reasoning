PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be disconnected (DC), since EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, if x is disconnected from y, it must also be disconnected from z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EC(x,z) would require x and z to touch at a boundary, but DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) imply no contact.
- PO(x,z) would require partial overlap, contradicting disconnection.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) would imply that x is part of z or vice versa, which is inconsistent with disconnection.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical, but DC(x,y) implies x and y are distinct, and since y and z are identical, x cannot be identical to z.

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
