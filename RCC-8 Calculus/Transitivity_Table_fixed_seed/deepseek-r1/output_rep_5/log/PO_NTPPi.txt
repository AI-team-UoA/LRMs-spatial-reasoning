PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations. Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y (entirely contained within y without touching its boundary), and x partially overlaps y (sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other), the following relations between x and z are possible:

1. **DC(x,z)**: If z is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with x, then x and z are disconnected and share no parts.
2. **PO(x,z)**: If z spans the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y (partially in the region shared by x and y, and partially in the region of y not shared with x), then x and z partially overlap.
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x). If z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x (contained within x without touching its boundary).

Other relations (EC, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, EQ) are not possible due to the constraints of PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
