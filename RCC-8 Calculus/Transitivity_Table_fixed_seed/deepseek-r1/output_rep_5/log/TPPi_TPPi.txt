PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which translate to TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y) respectively, the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of these relations.

- TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be a proper part of x. The tangency condition determines the specific relation:
- If z touches the boundary of x (e.g., at a point where y also touches x), then TPP(z,x) holds, meaning the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).
- If z does not touch the boundary of x (e.g., z touches y at an interior point of x), then NTPP(z,x) holds, meaning the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are TPPi and NTPPi. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as z is entirely contained within x (ruling out DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, NTPP, and their inverses except as specified).

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
