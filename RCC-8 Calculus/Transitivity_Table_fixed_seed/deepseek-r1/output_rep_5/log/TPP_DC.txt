PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y), meaning x is a tangential proper part of y, and DC(y,z), meaning y and z are disconnected with no shared parts, the possible relationship between x and z must ensure no shared parts between x and z. Since x is part of y and y is disconnected from z, any shared part between x and z would imply a shared part between y and z, contradicting DC(y,z). Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z), indicating that x and z are disconnected and share no parts.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
