PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. This means x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary, and similarly for z with respect to y. The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and does not touch z's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (identical regions).

All eight relations are possible because x and z can be arranged in any relative configuration within y, including being disjoint, touching, overlapping, or one being a part of the other (in either tangential or non-tangential ways), or being the same region.
