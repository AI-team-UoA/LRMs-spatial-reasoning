PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the constraints of the RCC-8 calculus. Since x and y share no parts (DC), and y and z partially overlap (PO), meaning they share some interior parts but neither is part of the other, the relations between x and z must avoid any implication that x shares parts with y through z.

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely disconnected from z, as x and y share no parts, and z may have regions not overlapping with y.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts, which can occur if the contact point is in a region of z not overlapping with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other, specifically in regions of z not overlapping with y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z, entirely contained within z but touching its boundary, in a region disjoint from y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, entirely contained within z without touching its boundary, in a region disjoint from y.

The following relations are impossible:
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Would imply z is a proper part of x, but since y and z share parts (PO), this would force x and y to share parts, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would imply x and z are identical, but DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) cannot both hold if x and z are equal, as PO(y,z) would imply PO(y,x), contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
