PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)):

- EC(x,y) implies x and y share a boundary but no interior points, so x is outside y except for the boundary contact.
- NTPP(z,y) implies z is entirely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is strictly inside y (non-tangential) and x only contacts y at its boundary (with no interior overlap), x and z share no points:
- z is interior to y, so it avoids the boundary where x contacts y.
- x has no interior overlap with y, so it cannot overlap with z inside y.

Thus, x and z are disconnected (DC). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as partial overlap, tangential/non-tangential part relations, or equality would require shared points or containment, which are excluded here.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
