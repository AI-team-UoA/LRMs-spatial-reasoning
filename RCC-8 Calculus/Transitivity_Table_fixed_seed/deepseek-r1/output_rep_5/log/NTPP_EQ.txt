PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and does not touch y's boundary).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since EQ(y,z) implies y and z are the same spatial region, the relationship between x and z must be identical to the relationship between x and y. Therefore, NTPP(x,y) directly implies NTPP(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- x cannot be equal to z (as x is a proper part of y, hence z).
- x must remain entirely within z without touching its boundary (non-tangential).

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
