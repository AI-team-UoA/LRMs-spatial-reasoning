PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely inside x and does not touch x's boundary). Also, DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no parts. The possible relationships between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely disconnected from x. Since y is inside x and disconnected from z, z could be outside x.
- **EC(x,z)**: z touches x's boundary externally. y is inside x and does not touch the boundary, so y and z remain disconnected.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. The overlap region must avoid y (since DC(y,z)), which is possible as y is only a part of x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). z and y can be disconnected inside x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and does not touch x's boundary). z and y can be disconnected inside x.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would imply y is inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would place x inside z, making y (inside x) part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
