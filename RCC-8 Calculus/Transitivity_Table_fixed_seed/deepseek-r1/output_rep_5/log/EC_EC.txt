PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. The possible relations are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected if they do not share any boundary or interior points, for example, when x and z are on opposite sides of y without touching.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts, for example, when x, y, and z form a chain where x and z touch directly.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other, for example, when x and z both touch y and extend to overlap with each other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and touches z's boundary, and this is consistent with the given relations.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (the same region), which is consistent as EC(x,y) and EC(y,x) hold.

The relations NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible because if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (or vice versa), it would not have a boundary exposed to allow direct external connection with y, contradicting EC(x,y) or EC(y,z).

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ
