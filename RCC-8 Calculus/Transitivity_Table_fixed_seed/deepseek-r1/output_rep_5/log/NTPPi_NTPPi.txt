PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z):

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x by transitivity of NTPP. Therefore, NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible since z is a proper part of x (via y).
- TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) would imply tangential contact, but the non-tangential condition prevents this.
- PO(x,z), EC(x,z), or DC(x,z) are impossible due to the containment (z is entirely within x).
- Other relations like NTPP(x,z) or TPP(x,z) would imply x is part of z, contradicting the given that z is part of x.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).
