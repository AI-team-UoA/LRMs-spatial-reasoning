PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

Given NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be part of x. Additionally, because z does not touch y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary (as any point on x's boundary that z might touch would require it to be on y's boundary, which is not the case). Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x).

The relation between x and z is then R(x,z) = NTPPi, as NTPPi(x,z) is defined as NTPP(z,x).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO: Not possible, as x and z share interior points (since z is part of x).
- TPP, NTPP: These would imply x is part of z, but z is part of y and y is a proper part of x, so x cannot be part of z.
- TPPi: Would imply z is a tangential proper part of x, but z does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ: Not possible, as z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
