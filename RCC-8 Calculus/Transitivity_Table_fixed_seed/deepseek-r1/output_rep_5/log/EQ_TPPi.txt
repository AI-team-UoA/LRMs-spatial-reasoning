PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially identical. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. Since x and y are identical, z must also be a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer:  
TPPi(x,z)
