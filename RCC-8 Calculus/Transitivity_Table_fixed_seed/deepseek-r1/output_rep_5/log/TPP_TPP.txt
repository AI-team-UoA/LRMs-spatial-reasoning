PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

- TPP(x,z) is possible if x touches the boundary of z, which can occur when x touches the part of y's boundary that coincides with z's boundary (e.g., at the point of tangency between y and z).
- NTPP(x,z) is possible if x does not touch the boundary of z, which occurs when x touches y's boundary at a point interior to z (not on z's boundary).

Other relations are not possible because:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, implying x â‰  z.
- PO(x,z), DC(x,z), EC(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because x is a proper part of z, so x and z cannot be disconnected, externally connected, or have z as a proper part of x.

### Answer: TPP, NTPP
