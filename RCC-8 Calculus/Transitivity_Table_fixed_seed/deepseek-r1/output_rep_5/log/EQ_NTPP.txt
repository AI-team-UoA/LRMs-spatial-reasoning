PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are identical. Since NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is entirely contained within z and does not touch its boundary), and x is identical to y, it follows that x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as they would contradict the given relations. For example:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because NTPP(y,z) implies y ≠ z, and since x = y, x ≠ z.
- TPP(x,z) is impossible because NTPP specifies no boundary touching, while TPP requires it.
- Other relations like DC, EC, PO, TPPi, or NTPPi are inconsistent with y being a proper part of z and x being identical to y.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
