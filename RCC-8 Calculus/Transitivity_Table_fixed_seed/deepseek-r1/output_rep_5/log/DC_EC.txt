PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. The relations DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP are possible, while EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible due to the constraints imposed by DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected, meaning x and z share no common points. This occurs if x and z are positioned such that there is no overlap or contact.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected, meaning x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if x is adjacent to z without overlapping, and the configuration avoids any conflict with DC(x,y).
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping, meaning x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other. This can happen if x overlaps with z in a way that does not involve y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z and positioned such that it does not force a connection with y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is contained in z and does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely within z's interior, away from the boundary where y and z connect.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,x)), and NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, contradicting DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is part of x, but since EC(y,z) means z touches y, this would force x to share a point with y, violating DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
