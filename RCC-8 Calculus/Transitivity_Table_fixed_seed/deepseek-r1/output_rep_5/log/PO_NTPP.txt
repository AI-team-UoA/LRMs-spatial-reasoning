PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: This occurs when x partially overlaps z. Since y is entirely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x shares a part with y but extends beyond y, x may also extend beyond z, leading to partial overlap between x and z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: This occurs when x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary, but is not equal to z, then TPP holds. This is possible because the part of x overlapping with y is inside z, and x may be contained within z while touching its boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: This occurs when x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary, then NTPP holds. This is possible if x is fully inside z, derived from its overlap with y (which is non-tangential in z), and x remains away from z's boundary.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because x and y overlap (PO(x,y)), and y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), so x and z share a common part (the overlap region of x and y).
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible because x and z share interior parts (from the PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)), not just a boundary.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal is impossible because y is a proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), but x only partially overlaps y (PO(x,y)), so x cannot be identical to z.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: These inverses (meaning z is a proper part of x) are impossible because y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and if z were inside x, then y would be inside x, contradicting PO(x,y) which requires that y is not a part of x.

Thus, the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
