PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of the spatial relations. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, so y ⊆ x and y touches the boundary of x. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y ⊆ z and y does not touch the boundary of z.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, where x and z share some parts but each has parts not shared by the other. This is possible because x may extend beyond z or z may extend beyond x, while both contain y and satisfy the boundary conditions.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, where x is a tangential proper part of z, so x ⊆ z and x touches the boundary of z. This is possible if y touches the boundary of x at a point not coinciding with where x touches z, ensuring y does not touch the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, where x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so x ⊆ z and x does not touch the boundary of z. This is possible because y touching the boundary of x occurs within the interior of z, consistent with y not touching the boundary of z.

The relations DC(x,z), EC(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible:
- DC and EC are impossible because x and z share y as a common part.
- EQ is impossible because y is a proper part of both x and z, but with conflicting boundary conditions (y touches ∂x but not ∂z, which would be inconsistent if x and z were equal).
- TPPi(x,z) (i.e., TPP(z,x)) and NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) are impossible because they would require z ⊆ x, leading to a contradiction with y touching ∂x while being contained in z (which would prevent y from touching ∂x if z is a proper part of x).

Thus, the possible relationships are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
