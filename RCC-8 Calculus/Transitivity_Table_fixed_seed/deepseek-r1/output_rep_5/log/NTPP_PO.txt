PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z). NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary. PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap; they share some interior points but neither is a part of the other.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the following cases based on the position of x relative to the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y and z:

1. **x entirely within the overlapping part of y and z**:  
   Since x is inside the region where y and z overlap, x is entirely contained within z.  
   - If x does not touch the boundary of z, then **NTPP(x,z)**.  
   - If x touches the boundary of z (which may be internal to y), then **TPP(x,z)**.  

2. **x entirely within the non-overlapping part of y (not overlapping with z)**:  
   Here, x is in y but has no interior points in common with z.  
   - If x does not touch the boundary of z, then **DC(x,z)**.  
   - If x touches the boundary of z (e.g., at the interface between overlapping and non-overlapping parts), then **EC(x,z)**.  

3. **x spans both the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y**:  
   As a connected region, x can straddle the boundary between the parts of y that overlap with z and those that do not.  
   - x shares interior points with z (in the overlapping part) but also has parts outside z (in the non-overlapping part), so neither is part of the other, leading to **PO(x,z)**.  

The relations EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible:  
- **EQ(x,z)**: x is strictly inside y (by NTPP), and y is not equal to z (by PO), so x cannot equal z.  
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: These would require z to be a proper part of x, but x is entirely within y and z is not contained in y (by PO), so z cannot be part of x.  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
