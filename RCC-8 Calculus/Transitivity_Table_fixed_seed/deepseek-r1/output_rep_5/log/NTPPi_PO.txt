PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch its boundary.  
Given PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap: they share some spatial parts, but neither is a part of the other.  

The possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:  
- Since y is inside x and z overlaps y, z must intersect x (i.e., they cannot be disconnected or externally connected).  
- z cannot be equal to x because that would imply PO(y,x), but y is a proper part of x, so PO(y,x) is impossible.  
- x cannot be a part of z (i.e., TPP or NTPP relations from z to x are impossible) because if x were part of z, then y would be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z) which requires that y is not a part of z.  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:  
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, where x and z share some parts but neither is part of the other. This occurs when z overlaps x and extends outside x.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary). This occurs when z is entirely within x and touches its boundary.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and does not touch its boundary). This occurs when z is entirely within x and does not touch the boundary.  

These cover all possible cases consistent with the given relations.

### Answer:  
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
