{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. Given EC(y,z), y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. Since x and y are identical, the relationship between x and z must be the same as that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 23.910823106765747, "reasoning-tokens": 369, "completion-tokens": 456}
