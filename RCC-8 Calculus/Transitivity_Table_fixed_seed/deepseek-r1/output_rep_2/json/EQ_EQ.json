{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) hold, meaning x and y are coincident (identical spatial regions) and y and z are coincident, it follows that x and z must also be coincident. This is due to the transitive property of the EQ relation, which is an equivalence relation. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 12.972620725631714, "reasoning-tokens": 207, "completion-tokens": 294}
