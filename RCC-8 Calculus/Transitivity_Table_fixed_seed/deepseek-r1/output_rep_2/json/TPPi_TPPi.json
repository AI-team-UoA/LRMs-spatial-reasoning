{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):  \n- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x.  \n- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y.  \n\nThe composition of TPP(z,y) and TPP(y,x) results in NTPP(z,x) (non-tangential proper part), as per the RCC-8 composition table. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  \n\nThus, the relation between x and z is the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).  \n\n### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 249.70848989486694, "reasoning-tokens": 7022, "completion-tokens": 7182}
