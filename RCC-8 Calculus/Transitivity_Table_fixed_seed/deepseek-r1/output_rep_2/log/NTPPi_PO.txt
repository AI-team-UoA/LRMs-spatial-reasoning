PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of x without touching its boundary. Also given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap: they share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other, and they are not equal.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. **PO(x,z) is possible**:  
   - Since y is inside x and overlaps with z, there is a part of z that overlaps with y and hence lies inside x.  
   - However, z may extend outside x, as PO(y,z) implies z has parts not in y (and possibly not in x). This results in partial overlap between x and z.

2. **TPPi(x,z) is possible**:  
   - TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x.  
   - z could be entirely within x, touching x's boundary, while partially overlapping with y (which is inside x). PO(y,z) is satisfied as long as z is not a part of y and shares only partial overlap.

3. **NTPPi(x,z) is possible**:  
   - NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  
   - z could be entirely within the interior of x (not touching the boundary), while partially overlapping with y. This is consistent with PO(y,z).

Other relations are impossible:  
- **DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)**: Contradicted because y is inside x and overlaps z, so x and z must share interior parts.  
- **PO(x,z) already covers partial overlap without containment.  
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Would require x to be a proper part of z, but y is inside x and not entirely in z (from PO(y,z)), so z cannot contain all of x.  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would imply x and z are the same, but y is a proper part of x and not entirely in z, contradicting PO(y,z).  

Thus, the possible relations for (x,z) are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
