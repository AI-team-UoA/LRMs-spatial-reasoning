PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z). This is because:

- EC(x,y) means x and y share a boundary but no interior points.
- NTPP(z,y) means z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- Since z is strictly inside y and not touching the boundary, and x only contacts y at the boundary without sharing interior, x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, they must be disconnected.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi, or EC would require some form of spatial overlap or connection, which is precluded by the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
