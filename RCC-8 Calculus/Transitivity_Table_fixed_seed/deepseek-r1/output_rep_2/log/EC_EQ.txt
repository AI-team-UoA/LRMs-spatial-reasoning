PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, any spatial relation involving y directly applies to z. Since EC(x,y) describes that x and y are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), substituting z for y results in the same relation between x and z. Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is EC(x,z).

Other relations are not possible:
- DC(x,z) would require x and z to be disconnected, but they touch.
- PO(x,z) would require sharing interior parts, which EC excludes.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but EC(x,y) indicates x is not part of y (and hence not part of z).
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, which is similarly excluded.
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but EC(x,y) implies x and y (and thus z) are distinct.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).
