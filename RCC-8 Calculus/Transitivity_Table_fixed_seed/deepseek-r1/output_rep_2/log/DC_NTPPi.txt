PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely contained within y, not touching y's boundary).

Since z is entirely inside y (NTPP(z,y)) and x has no spatial overlap with y (DC(x,y)), x cannot share any part with z. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

The only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
