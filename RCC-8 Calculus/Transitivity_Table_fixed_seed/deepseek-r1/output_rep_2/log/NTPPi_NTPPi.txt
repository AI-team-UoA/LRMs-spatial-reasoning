PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which translate to:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since NTPP is transitive in the RCC-8 calculus, z being a non-tangential proper part of y and y being a non-tangential proper part of x implies that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z because:
- z must be entirely contained within x due to the transitivity of containment.
- The non-tangential condition ensures that z does not touch the boundary of x, ruling out TPP or other relations.
- Equality (EQ) is impossible since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so x and z cannot be coincident.
- Disconnection (DC), external contact (EC), partial overlap (PO), or tangential proper part relations (TPP, TPPi) are inconsistent with the nested non-tangential containment.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:  
NTPPi(x,z)
