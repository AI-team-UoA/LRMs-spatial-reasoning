PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations. NTPP(x,y) indicates that x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary. PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but with each having parts not shared by the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected, if x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, if x spans both the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y and z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and does not touch z's boundary.

Relations such as EQ (coincident), EC (externally connected), TPPi (inverse of TPP), or NTPPi (inverse of NTPP) are not possible due to the constraints imposed by NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
