PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be disconnected. Since x is entirely contained within y (non-tangentially) and y is disconnected from z, x cannot share any parts with z. This is because any shared part between x and z would imply that y and z share that part (due to x being part of y), contradicting DC(y,z). Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
