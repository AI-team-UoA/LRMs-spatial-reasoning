PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical, and TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, the relationship between x and z must be the same as between y and z due to the identity. Therefore, TPP(x,z) holds, meaning x is a tangential proper part of z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- NTPP(x,z) would imply x does not touch z's boundary, but TPP(y,z) requires touching the boundary, and since x = y, this is inconsistent.
- Other relations like PO, EC, DC, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ are incompatible with TPP(y,z) and the identity EQ(x,y).

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).
