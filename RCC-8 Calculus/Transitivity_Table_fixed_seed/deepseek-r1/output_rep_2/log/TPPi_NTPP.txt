PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, meaning x and z share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, meaning x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, meaning x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

These are the only possible relations, as derived from the constraints:
- TPPi(x,y) implies TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x (y touches x's boundary).
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary).
- Other RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, EQ, TPPi, NTPPi) are impossible due to contradictions with the given relations (e.g., y being part of both x and z prevents DC and EC; EQ would require x and z to be equal, conflicting with y being a proper part; TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is part of x, but this forces y to be inside x away from the boundary, contradicting TPP(y,x)).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
