PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z):  
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary).  
- TPP(y,z) implies y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary).  

The relationship between x and z must satisfy:  
- x is a proper part of z (since x is part of y and y is part of z, transitivity holds).  
- However, x may or may not touch z's boundary:  
  - **TPP(x,z)** is possible if x touches z's boundary (e.g., x touches the part of y that is on z's boundary).  
  - **NTPP(x,z)** is possible if x is entirely inside z without touching its boundary (e.g., x touches an internal boundary of y, not aligned with z's boundary).  

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:  
- DC, EC: x and z overlap.  
- PO: x is a proper part of z, not partially overlapping.  
- EQ: x and z cannot be equal (x is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of z).  
- TPPi, NTPPi: z cannot be a proper part of x (since x is part of y and y is part of z).  

Thus, the possible relations are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
