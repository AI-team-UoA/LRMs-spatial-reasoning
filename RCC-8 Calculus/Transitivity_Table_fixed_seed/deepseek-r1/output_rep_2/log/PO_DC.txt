PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined as follows:

- Since PO(x,y) indicates partial overlap between x and y, they share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other.
- DC(y,z) indicates y and z are disconnected with no shared parts.
- The part of x overlapping with y must be disjoint from z (due to DC(y,z)).
- The part of x not overlapping with y (x_minus_y) can relate to z in various ways:
  - **DC(x,z)**: If x_minus_y is entirely disjoint from z.
  - **EC(x,z)**: If x_minus_y touches z at a boundary but shares no interior parts.
  - **PO(x,z)**: If x_minus_y and z partially overlap in their interiors, and neither is a proper part of the other.
  - **TPPi(x,z)**: If z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is entirely within x_minus_y and touches x's boundary).
  - **NTPPi(x,z)**: If z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is entirely within x_minus_y and does not touch x's boundary).

The relations TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because if x were a proper part of z, the part of x overlapping with y would be in z, contradicting DC(y,z). EQ(x,z) is impossible as it would imply PO(y,z), contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
