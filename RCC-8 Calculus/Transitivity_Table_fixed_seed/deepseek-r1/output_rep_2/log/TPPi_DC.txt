PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), which translate to TPP(y,x) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if z is entirely outside x, as y is inside x and disconnected from z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if z touches the boundary of x at a point distinct from where y touches, maintaining no overlap with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if z partially overlaps x in regions not occupied by y, since y is disconnected from z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Possible if z is inside x, touching its boundary at a point different from y's contact, and disconnected from y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Possible if z is entirely inside x without touching its boundary, and disconnected from y.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would imply that y (inside x) shares points with z, contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
