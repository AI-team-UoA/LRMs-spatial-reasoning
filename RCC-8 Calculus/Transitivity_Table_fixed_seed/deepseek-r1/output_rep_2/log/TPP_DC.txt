PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. Thus, x is entirely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, sharing no points (neither interior nor boundary).

Since x is entirely within y (every point of x is a point of y) and y is disconnected from z (no points in common between y and z), it follows that x and z share no points. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

Examining other RCC-8 relations:
- **EC(x,z)**: Requires touching at a boundary without sharing interior points. However, x is inside y and y has no contact with z, so x and z cannot touch.
- **PO(x,z)**: Requires sharing some interior points but neither being part of the other. Since x is inside y and y is disjoint from z, no overlap is possible.
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: These require x being part of z or z being part of x. However, x is inside y, and y is disjoint from z, so x cannot be part of z, nor can z be part of x.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Requires x and z to be identical. This would imply x (as z) is disconnected from y, contradicting TPP(x,y).

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
