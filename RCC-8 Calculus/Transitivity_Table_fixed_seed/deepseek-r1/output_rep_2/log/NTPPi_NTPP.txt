PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary).
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary).

Since y is contained in the interior of both x and z, x and z must share common interior points. Therefore, the relations DC(x,z) (disconnected) and EC(x,z) (externally connected) are impossible, as they imply no common interior.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (share some parts, but neither is a part of the other).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x) (z is a tangential proper part of x).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x).

All other relations (DC and EC) are excluded.
