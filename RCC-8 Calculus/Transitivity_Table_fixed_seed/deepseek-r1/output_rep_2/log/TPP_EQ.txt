PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z):  
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary).  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions).  

Since y and z are identical, the relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Thus, x is a tangential proper part of z.  
Therefore, the only possible relation is TPP(x,z).  

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
