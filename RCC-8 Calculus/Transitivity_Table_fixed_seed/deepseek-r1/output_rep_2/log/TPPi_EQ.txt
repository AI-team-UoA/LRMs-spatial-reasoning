PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) implies TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions).

Since y and z are identical, the relationship between x and z is the same as between x and y. Therefore, TPPi(x,y) directly implies TPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi.
