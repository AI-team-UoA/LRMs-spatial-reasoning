PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are identical spatial regions. PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap, meaning they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other and they are not equal.

Since x is identical to y, the relation between x and z must be the same as between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

This is consistent with the RCC-8 composition table, where EQ composed with PO results in PO.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
