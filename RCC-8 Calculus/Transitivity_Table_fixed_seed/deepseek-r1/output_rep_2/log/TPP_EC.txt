PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).  

- **DC(x,z)**: This occurs if x is not on the boundary where y and z touch. Since x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP), it may be located entirely within the interior of y away from the boundary with z, resulting in x and z being disconnected.  
- **EC(x,z)**: This occurs if x is on the boundary where y and z touch. Since TPP(x,y) implies x touches y's boundary, and EC(y,z) implies y and z share a boundary point, x may directly touch z at that shared boundary, resulting in external connection.  

Other RCC-8 relations are not possible:  
- PO(x,z) is impossible because y and z have disjoint interiors (due to EC), and x's interior is part of y's interior, so x and z cannot share any interior parts.  
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) are impossible because x is part of y, and y is only externally connected to z (not a part of or equal to z).  

Thus, the only possible relations are DC and EC.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
