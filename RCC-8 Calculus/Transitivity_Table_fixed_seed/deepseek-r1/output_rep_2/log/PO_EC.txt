PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are limited to DC(x,z) or EC(x,z). 

- PO(x,y) means x and y share interior parts but neither is a subset of the other.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.

Since x shares interior with y and y has no interior shared with z, x and z cannot share interior parts, ruling out PO, EQ, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi. The only possibilities are:
- **DC(x,z)**: If x is not near the boundary where y and z touch, x and z may be disconnected.
- **EC(x,z)**: If x extends to the boundary where y and z touch, x and z may touch at that boundary without sharing interior.

Thus, the possible relations are DC or EC.

### Answer: DC or EC
