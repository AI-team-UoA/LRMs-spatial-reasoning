PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (identical regions), and DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (no shared parts), the relationship between x and z must also be disconnected. This is because if x and y are identical, then any spatial relation involving y and z must hold identically for x and z. Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
