PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z):

- NTPP(x,y) implies that x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) implies that y and z share a boundary but have no interior overlap.

Since x is strictly inside y (not touching its boundary), and y only contacts z at y's boundary, x cannot interact with z. Specifically:
- x and z share no common points (interior or boundary) because x is separated from z by y's boundary.
- This satisfies DC(x,z), meaning x and z are disconnected.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- **EC(x,z)**: Requires touching at a boundary, but x does not reach y's boundary.
- **PO(x,z)**: Requires interior overlap, but x is entirely within y, and z has no interior overlap with y.
- **TPP/NTPP(x,z) or TPPi/NTPPi(x,z)**: Require containment, but x is inside y, and z is outside y (except for boundary contact).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Requires coincidence, which is impossible.

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
