PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if the part of x overlapping y does not intersect z (e.g., x overlaps a region of y disjoint from z).
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch only at a boundary point without sharing interior (e.g., x touches z's boundary within y).
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z share interior points but neither is a part of the other (e.g., x overlaps y and partially covers z).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Possible if z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary (e.g., z inside y is contained in x's overlap region and touches x's inner boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Possible if z is entirely within x's interior without touching its boundary (e.g., z inside y is strictly interior to x's overlap region).

Impossible relations:
- **TPP(x,z)** and **NTPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a proper part of z because x has parts outside y, while z is entirely inside y.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be equal because x is not entirely in y (by PO), while z is entirely in y (by NTPP).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
