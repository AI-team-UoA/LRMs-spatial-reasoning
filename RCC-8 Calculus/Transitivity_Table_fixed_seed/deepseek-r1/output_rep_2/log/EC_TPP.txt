PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations allowed under the RCC-8 calculus.

- EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected; they share a boundary point but no interior points.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z; y is part of z and shares a boundary point with z.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if x is entirely outside z and does not touch z, for example, if x touches y at a point not on z's boundary and x does not intersect z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This occurs if x touches z at a boundary point, for instance, when x touches y at the same point where y touches z's boundary, and x does not share interior with z.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs if x shares an interior point with z, for example, when x touches y at a point interior to z, requiring x to overlap z's interior.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs if x is part of z and touches z's boundary, for instance, if both x and y are parts of z with EC(x,y), and x is tangential to z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This occurs if x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary, for example, if both x and y are parts of z with EC(x,y), and x is entirely within z's interior.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but y is a proper part of z and x touches y externally, so x cannot be identical to z.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a part of x, but since y is part of z, this would mean y is part of x, contradicting EC(x,y) which requires no shared interior points.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
