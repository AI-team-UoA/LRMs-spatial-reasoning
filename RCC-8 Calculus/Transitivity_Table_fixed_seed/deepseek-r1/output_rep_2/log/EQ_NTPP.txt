PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (identical regions), and NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z without touching its boundary), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. This is because x and y are the same region, so the relationship between x and z is identical to that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
