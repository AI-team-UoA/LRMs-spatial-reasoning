PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the RCC-8 composition. Since x is a tangential proper part of y (touching y's boundary) and z is a non-tangential proper part of y (entirely within y's interior without touching the boundary), the following relations between x and z are possible:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This occurs if x and z have no common points, for example, if x is near one part of y's boundary and z is deep inside y but not overlapping or touching x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This can happen if x and z are adjacent within y, sharing a boundary point but not overlapping interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x extends inward from y's boundary and overlaps with z's interior region.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary (but not y's boundary, as required by NTPPi(y,z)).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In this case, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because:
- If x were part of z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)) or equal to z (EQ(x,z)), then x touching y's boundary would imply that z also touches y's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(y,z) (which requires z not to touch y's boundary).

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
