PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)):

- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y: z is part of y, touches y's boundary, and is not equal to y.

Since z is part of y (TPP(z,y)), every point of z is also a point of y. Because x and y share no points (DC(x,y)), x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- **EC(x,z)**: Requires touching at a boundary, but this would imply x and y share a boundary point (since z's boundary is part of y's boundary), contradicting DC(x,y).
- **PO(x,z)**: Requires partial overlap, but any shared point would be in both x and y (via z), contradicting DC(x,y).
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**, or **EQ(x,z)**: Require x to be part of z or vice versa, implying x and z share points, which would also imply x and y share points (via z), contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
