PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of x, sharing no boundary with x, and y â‰  x.
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

We need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

### Reasoning:
1. **y is inside x**: Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, y is strictly within the interior of x and does not touch its boundary.
2. **y and z are disconnected**: y and z have no common parts (no overlap in interior or boundary).

Given this, consider the spatial relationship between x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if z is entirely outside x. Since y is inside x and disconnected from z, z being outside x ensures no conflict.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if z touches the boundary of x but does not overlap its interior. The boundary touch does not involve y (as y is interior and non-tangential), so DC(y,z) holds.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if z partially overlaps x in regions not containing y. Since y is inside x but confined to a part of the interior, z can overlap x elsewhere without intersecting y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z inside x and touching x's boundary). This is possible if z is placed inside x without overlapping y and touches the boundary (which y avoids).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z inside x without touching its boundary). This is possible if z is entirely within x, avoiding y and the boundary.

### Excluded relations:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible because if x = z, then y is inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **TPP(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPPi(z,x), meaning x is a tangential proper part of z. Then y inside x implies y inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPPi(z,x), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Then y inside x implies y inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
