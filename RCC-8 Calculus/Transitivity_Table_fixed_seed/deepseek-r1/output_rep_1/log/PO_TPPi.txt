PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations allowed under the RCC-8 calculus.

- PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap; they share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y; z is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Based on these relations, the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if the region where x overlaps y does not include the location of z, so they share no common parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This occurs if x and z touch at a boundary point (e.g., where z touches y's boundary) but share no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs if x shares some interior parts with z but neither is a proper part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if x fully contains z and z touches x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if x fully contains z and z does not touch x's boundary.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(y,z) (inverse of TPP), and NTPPi(y,z) (inverse of NTPP) are not possible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but PO(x,y) implies x and y are not identical, and z is a proper part of y.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply that x is a proper part of z, but since z is a proper part of y and PO(x,y) implies x is not a part of y, this leads to a contradiction.
- TPPi and NTPPi from y to z are not relevant for the x-z relation.

Thus, all possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
