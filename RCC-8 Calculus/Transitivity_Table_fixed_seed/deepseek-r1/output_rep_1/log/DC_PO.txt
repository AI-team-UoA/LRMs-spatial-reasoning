PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by considering the spatial constraints:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. Since x is entirely separate from y, and z only partially overlaps with y, it is possible for x to be entirely outside z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. x can be adjacent to the part of z that does not overlap with y, allowing boundary contact without overlapping interiors.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. The non-overlapping part of z (with y) may intersect with x, sharing some interior points but not entirely containing each other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. x can be inside z, touching z's boundary, as long as it lies in the region of z not overlapping with y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x can be entirely inside z without touching its boundary, again in the region of z disjoint from y.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- TPPi/NTPPi would imply z is inside x, but then z overlaps y (from PO(y,z)), forcing x and y to share parts, contradicting DC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) would make x and z identical, but then PO(y,z) implies PO(y,x), contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
