PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.  
Given EC(y,z), which means y and z are externally connected; they share a boundary point but no interior points.  

The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the spatial constraints:  
- Since y is inside x and not touching x's boundary, z must touch y at a point that is interior to x.  
- This implies that z cannot be disconnected from x (DC is impossible) or externally connected to x (EC is impossible) because the contact point is interior to x, not on its boundary.  
- z could partially overlap with x (PO), be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi), or be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi).  

Thus, the possible relations are:  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap; they share some interior points but neither is part of the other.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x; z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x; z is entirely within x and does not touch the boundary of x.  

These cover all possible cases given the initial relations.
