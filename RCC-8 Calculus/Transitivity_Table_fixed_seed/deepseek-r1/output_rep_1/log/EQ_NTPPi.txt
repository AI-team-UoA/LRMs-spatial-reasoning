PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident (i.e., identical regions). Given NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary). Since x and y are identical, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z) (which directly corresponds to NTPP(z,x)).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
