PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):  
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x.  
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y.  

Since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z must be a proper part of x. The possible relationships between x and z depend on whether z touches the boundary of x:  
- If z touches the boundary of x, then TPP(z,x) holds, meaning TPPi(x,z).  
- If z does not touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x) holds, meaning NTPPi(x,z).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z). Other relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, EQ) are not possible because z is necessarily a proper part of x and cannot be disconnected, externally connected, partially overlapping, or equal to x.

### Answer:  
TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)
