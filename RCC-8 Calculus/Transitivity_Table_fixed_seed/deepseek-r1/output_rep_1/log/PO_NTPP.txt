PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z using the RCC-8 composition principles:

- **PO(x,y)**: x and y partially overlap; they share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other.
- **NTPP(y,z)**: y is a non-tangential proper part of z; y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

The part of x that overlaps with y (from PO(x,y)) must be inside z (since NTPP(y,z) implies y ⊆ z). However, the part of x not overlapping with y may be:
1. Entirely inside z, leading to x being a proper part of z (either TPP or NTPP).
2. Partially or fully outside z, leading to partial overlap (PO).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **PO(x,z)**: If x extends outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: If x is entirely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC, EC: Contradicted by shared interior parts (via y).
- EQ, TPPi, NTPPi: Would imply z ⊆ x, but y ⊆ z ⊆ x contradicts PO(x,y) (which requires y not entirely in x).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
