PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the transitivity and composition properties of the RCC-8 relations. Specifically, since y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z, x and z must share at least the region of y, meaning they cannot be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC). The possible relations are those where x and z may be equal, one may be a proper part of the other (tangential or non-tangential), or they may partially overlap.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partial overlap, where x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other.
- EQ(x,z): Equality, where x and z are coincident.
- TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part, where x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part, where x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): Inverse of TPP, equivalent to TPP(z,x), where z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Inverse of NTPP, equivalent to NTPP(z,x), where z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

These cover all consistent possibilities given the constraints.

### Answer: PO(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
