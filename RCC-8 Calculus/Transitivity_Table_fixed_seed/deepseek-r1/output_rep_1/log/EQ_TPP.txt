PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (identical), and TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary), the relationship between x and z must be the same as that between y and z because x and y are identical.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

### Answer:  
TPP(x,z)
