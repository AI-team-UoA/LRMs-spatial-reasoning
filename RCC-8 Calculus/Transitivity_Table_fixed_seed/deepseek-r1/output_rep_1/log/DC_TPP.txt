PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the constraints and the RCC-8 calculus:

- DC(x,y) implies x and y are disconnected (no common parts).
- TPP(y,z) implies y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary).

Since x has no common parts with y, and y is part of z, x cannot be connected to y. However, x may interact with z in the following ways:
- **DC(x,z)**: x is entirely outside z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x touches z externally but shares no interior parts (e.g., at a boundary not shared with y).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (sharing some interior parts, but not completely, and not violating DC(x,y)).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary, without overlapping y).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is entirely inside z without touching the boundary, and disconnected from y).

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible because:
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, forcing x to contain y (since y is part of z), contradicting DC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) would make x and z identical, but then TPP(y,z) implies y is part of x, violating DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
