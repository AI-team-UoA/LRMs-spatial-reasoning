PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z. Since x is inside y but not overlapping z, x and z share no parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs if x spans the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y and z. Part of x is in z, and part is not, so they share some interior but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches the boundary of z. Since x is inside y (non-tangentially) but may touch z's boundary (which is internal to y), x is a proper part of z and touches its boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and does not touch the boundary of z. Thus, x is inside z without touching its boundary.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EC(x,z)**: Not possible, as x and z would share no interior, but if x overlaps z partially or fully, they share interior; if disjoint, it is DC.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible, as x is a proper part of y, while z only partially overlaps y, so they cannot be equal.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Impossible, as z cannot be a proper part of x because z is not contained within y (due to PO(y,z)), while x is entirely within y.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, PO, TPP, NTPP
