PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is part of x and touches the boundary of x. Additionally, EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.

The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the spatial constraints:
- Since y is part of x and touches its boundary, and z touches y externally, x and z must share at least a boundary point. Therefore, DC(x,z) (disconnected) is impossible.
- EQ(x,z) (equal) is impossible because y is part of x but EC to z, which would require y to share no interior with z, contradicting if x and z are the same.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) (x part of z) is impossible because if x were part of z, then y (part of x) would be part of z, but EC(y,z) requires no interior sharing, leading to contradiction.
- The possible relations are:
  - EC(x,z): If z is outside x but touches it at the shared boundary point with y.
  - PO(x,z): If z partially overlaps with x but neither is part of the other.
  - TPPi(x,z): Meaning TPP(z,x), where z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z inside x and touching its boundary).
  - NTPPi(x,z): Meaning NTPP(z,x), where z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., z inside x but not touching its boundary directly).

Thus, the possible relationships are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
