PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning:
- y is a proper part of x (y ⊂ x),
- y touches the boundary of x.

Given EQ(y,z), meaning y and z are coincident (y ≡ z), so z is identical to y.

Thus, the relationship between x and z is the same as between x and y: z is a tangential proper part of x. This corresponds to TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
