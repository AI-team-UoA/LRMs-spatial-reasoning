PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- **PO(x,y)**: x and y partially overlap; they share interior parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **NTPP(z,y)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of y; z is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Considering the spatial configuration:
1. If z is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with x, then x and z are disconnected: **DC(x,z)**.
2. If z overlaps partially with the overlapping region of x and y and partially with the non-overlapping part of y, then x and z partially overlap: **PO(x,z)**.
3. If z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y, then z is entirely within x (since the overlapping region is part of x) and is contained in the interior of x (because the overlapping region is interior to both x and y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x: **NTPPi(x,z)** (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).

These are the only possible relations, as other RCC-8 relations (EC, TPP, TPPi, EQ) are not feasible given the constraints. For example:
- EC is impossible because x and z either share interior parts (PO, NTPPi) or not (DC).
- TPP and TPPi require tangential contact, but the interior containment rules it out.
- EQ is impossible because z is entirely within y while x is not.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, PO, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, PO, NTPPi
