PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical spatial regions, and PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (sharing some spatial parts but neither being part of the other and not being equal), the relation between x and z must be the same as between y and z. Since x and y are identical, substituting x for y in PO(y,z) results in PO(x,z). Therefore, the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).

This is confirmed by the composition of RCC-8 relations, where EQ âˆ˜ PO = PO, meaning that if EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), then PO(x,z) must hold.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z share spatial parts (since y and z do, and x = y).
- EC(x,z) is impossible because EC requires no shared interior parts, but PO involves shared interior.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because PO implies neither is part of the other.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because PO(y,z) implies y and z are not equal, and thus x and z are not equal.

Thus, the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z)
