PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This means:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are constrained by the fact that both must touch y's boundary. Therefore:
- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are disconnected and share no parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z, but only if x touches z at the point where z touches y's boundary (so x still touches y's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)), but only if z touches x at the point where x touches y's boundary (so z still touches y's boundary).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are the same region.

The relations **NTPP(x,z)** and **NTPPi(x,z)** are impossible because:
- If NTPP(x,z) held, x would be inside z and not touch z's boundary, so x could not touch y's boundary (contradicting TPP(x,y)).
- Similarly, if NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) held, z would be inside x and not touch x's boundary, so z could not touch y's boundary (contradicting TPP(z,y)).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
