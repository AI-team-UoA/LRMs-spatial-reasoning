PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. NTPP(y,z) indicates that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely inside z and does not touch its boundary. Since x is identical to y, x must also be entirely inside z without touching its boundary. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
