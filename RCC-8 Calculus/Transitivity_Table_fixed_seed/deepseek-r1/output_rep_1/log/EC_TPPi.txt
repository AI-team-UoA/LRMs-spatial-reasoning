PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they share a boundary point but no interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is a proper part of y, shares a boundary point with y, and is not equal to y.

To determine possible relations between x and z:

1. **Interior disjointness**: The interior of x is disjoint from the interior of y (from EC(x,y)), and the interior of z is contained within the interior of y (from TPP(z,y)). Thus, the interiors of x and z are disjoint.
2. **Boundary interaction**: 
   - x shares a boundary point with y (from EC(x,y)).
   - z shares a boundary point with y (from TPP(z,y)).
   - The shared boundary point between x and y may or may not coincide with the shared boundary point between z and y.
     - If they coincide, then x and z share that boundary point, leading to EC(x,z).
     - If they do not coincide, then x and z share no boundary points, leading to DC(x,z).

Other relations are impossible:
- PO(x,z) would require shared interior parts, but interiors are disjoint.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi imply a part-whole relationship, which cannot hold since x is outside y and z is inside y.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible as x and z are distinct (x is not part of y, while z is).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **DC(x,z) and EC(x,z)**.

### Answer: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z)
