PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (i.e., identical regions), and EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected (touching at a boundary but sharing no interior parts), the relation between x and z must be the same as that between y and z because x and y are the same region.

Since EC(y,z) holds, and x is identical to y, the only possible relation between x and z is EC(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as EQ(x,y) directly transfers the relation from y to z to x to z.

Thus, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
