PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The reasoning is as follows:

- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is inside z and touches z's boundary).

Considering the spatial configurations:
- x must be connected to z because x touches y, and y is part of z, so they share a boundary point through y.
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z are connected.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because y is a proper part of z, and x is external to y.
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible because x touches y on z's boundary, so x cannot be entirely inside z without touching the boundary.
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because z contains y as a proper part, so z cannot be part of x without contradicting EC(x,y) (which requires no shared interior between x and y).

The possible relations are:
- **EC(x,z)**: If x is entirely outside z and touches it at the shared boundary point.
- **PO(x,z)**: If x partially overlaps with z (sharing some interior with z but neither being part of the other).
- **TPP(x,z)**: If x is entirely inside z and on its boundary (tangential proper part).

Thus, the possible relationships are EC, PO, and TPP.

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP
