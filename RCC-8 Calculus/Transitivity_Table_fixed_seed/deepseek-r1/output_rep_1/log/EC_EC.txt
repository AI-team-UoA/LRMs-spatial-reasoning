PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the RCC-8 composition table for the relations EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.  
  Example: x and z are on opposite sides of y, not touching.  
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally.  
  Example: x, y, z form a chain where x and z touch directly.  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.  
  Example: x and z extend beyond y and share an interior region.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.  
  Example: x is inside z and touches z's boundary via y.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).  
  Example: z is inside x and touches x's boundary via y.  
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident.  
  Example: x and z are the same region, both externally connected to y.  

The relations **NTPP** and **NTPPi** are impossible because EC constraints force x and z to interact at boundaries, preventing non-tangential containment.
