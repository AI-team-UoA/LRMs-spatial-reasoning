PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition rules:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs when z is entirely separate from both x and y.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. This is possible if z touches a boundary of x that is not shared with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This can happen if z overlaps with x in a region not adjacent to y, avoiding any connection with y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. z must be inside x and touch x's boundary at a point not adjacent to y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely inside x without touching any boundary, ensuring no contact with y.

Other relations are impossible:
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, or **EQ(x,z)** would imply x is part of z or coincident, conflicting with DC(y,z) since y (adjacent to x) would then relate to z.
- **DC** and **EC** are mutually exclusive with the part relations, but the above cases cover all consistent possibilities.
