PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) hold, this means:
- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are coincident (i.e., identical spatial regions).
- EQ(y,z) implies y and z are coincident.

By transitivity of equality, x and z must also be coincident. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is EQ(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi all imply that x and z are not identical (e.g., they differ in spatial extent, boundary contact, or proper part relationships).
- EQ is the only relation that denotes complete spatial coincidence.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
