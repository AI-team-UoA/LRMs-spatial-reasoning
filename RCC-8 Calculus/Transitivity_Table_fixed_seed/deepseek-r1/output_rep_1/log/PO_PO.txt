PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations. This is because the composition of PO with PO in the RCC-8 calculus results in the universal relation, meaning all eight relations are possible. Below are the relations with their definitions for clarity:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal).
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary).
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).

Each of these can occur under the given conditions PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), depending on the spatial configuration of the regions.
