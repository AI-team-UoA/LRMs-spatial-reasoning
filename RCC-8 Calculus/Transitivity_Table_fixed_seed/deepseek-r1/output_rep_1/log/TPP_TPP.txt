PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- Since x is part of y and y is part of z, x must be part of z, ruling out DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.
- Whether x touches z's boundary depends on the configuration:
  - If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x may touch z's boundary, resulting in TPP(x,z).
  - If x does not touch z's boundary (e.g., x is entirely within the interior of y away from the boundary with z), then NTPP(x,z) holds.

Thus, both TPP and NTPP are possible for the relationship between x and z.

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
