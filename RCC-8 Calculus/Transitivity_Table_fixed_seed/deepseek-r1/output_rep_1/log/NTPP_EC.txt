PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is that they are disconnected, meaning they share no spatial parts. This is because:

- NTPP(x,y) implies that x is entirely within the interior of y and does not touch the boundary of y.
- EC(y,z) implies that y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.

Since x is strictly inside y and not on the boundary, and y only touches z at the boundary with no interior overlap, x cannot share any parts with z or be connected to it. Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
