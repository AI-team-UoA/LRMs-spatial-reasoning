PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z must be determined.

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is part of y and shares a boundary point with y's exterior.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z: y is part of z and does not share any boundary points with z's exterior.

Since x is part of y (from TPP(x,y)) and y is part of z (from NTPP(y,z)), x must be part of z due to the transitivity of parthood. Furthermore, because y is entirely contained within the interior of z (not touching z's boundary), and x is part of y, x must also be entirely contained within the interior of z and cannot touch z's boundary. If x touched z's boundary, it would imply that y touches z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z). Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Other relations are not possible:
- DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) are inconsistent with x being a proper part of z that does not touch z's boundary.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
