PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y). This means:
- x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y without touching its boundary).
- z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary).

Possible relations between x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if they are non-overlapping parts of y (e.g., x is in the interior and z is at the boundary without touching).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. This is possible if they share a boundary point in the interior of y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if they share some interior parts but neither contains the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely inside z without touching its boundary.

Impossible relations:
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: This would imply z is a proper part of x, but z touches y's boundary while x is entirely interior, leading to a contradiction.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be coincident as they are distinct proper parts of y.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
