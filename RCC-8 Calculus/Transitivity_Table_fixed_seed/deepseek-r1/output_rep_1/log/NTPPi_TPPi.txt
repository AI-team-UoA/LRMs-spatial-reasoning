PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This implies z is contained within y and touches the boundary of y.

Since z is part of y and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z must also be a proper part of x. Specifically:
- Because y is entirely within the interior of x (not touching x's boundary) and z touches y's boundary (which is internal to x), z does not touch the boundary of x.
- Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x) holds.

This implies that the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), as NTPPi(x,z) is defined as NTPP(z,x).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is a proper part of x and cannot be equal to x.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because z is entirely contained within x (no partial overlap).
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) are impossible because z is part of x and not disconnected or externally connected.
- TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) would require z to touch x's boundary, but it does not.
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which is inconsistent with z being a part of x.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
