PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Analysis:
- Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, x is strictly inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- Since y is a tangential proper part of z, y is strictly inside z and touches z's boundary at some point(s).
- Because x is entirely inside y and y is entirely inside z, x must be entirely inside z.
- x cannot touch z's boundary:
  - If x were to touch z's boundary, it would require x to be at the point where y touches z's boundary. However, x does not touch y's boundary (by NTPP(x,y)), so it cannot be at that point. Thus, x remains strictly inside z without touching its boundary.
- Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z: NTPP(x,z).

The composition of NTPP and TPP in RCC-8 yields only NTPP. Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).
