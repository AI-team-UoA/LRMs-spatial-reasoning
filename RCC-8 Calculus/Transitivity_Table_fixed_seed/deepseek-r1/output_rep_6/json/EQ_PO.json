{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. Given PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap: they share some spatial parts but each has parts not shared with the other. Since x is identical to y, the relationship between x and z is the same as that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is PO.\n\n### Answer: PO", "elapsed-time": 28.1470730304718, "reasoning-tokens": 405, "completion-tokens": 493}
