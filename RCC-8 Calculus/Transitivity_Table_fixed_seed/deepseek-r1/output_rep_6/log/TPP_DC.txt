PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary.
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected: they share no spatial points.

Since x is a subset of y (every point of x is a point of y), and y and z share no points, it follows that x and z share no points. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- EC(x,z) would require x and z to touch at a boundary, but this would imply a common point, contradicting DC(y,z).
- PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would imply some overlap or containment, which is impossible since x ⊆ y and y ∩ z = ∅.

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
