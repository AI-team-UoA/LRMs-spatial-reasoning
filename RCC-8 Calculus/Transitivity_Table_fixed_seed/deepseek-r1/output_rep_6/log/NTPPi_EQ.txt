PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x without touching its boundary, and y ≠ x.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since z is identical to y, the relationship between x and z is the same as between x and y. Therefore:
- z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x) holds.
- NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z) by definition.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC, EC: Require no shared interior or boundary touching only, but z is entirely inside x.
- PO: Requires partial overlap without one being part of the other, but z is a proper part of x.
- TPP, TPPi: Require tangential contact (touching the boundary), but the relation is non-tangential.
- NTPP: Directly would be NTPP(z,x), but this is expressed as NTPPi(x,z) in the relation set.
- EQ: Impossible because y (and thus z) is a proper part of x, so x ≠ z.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).
