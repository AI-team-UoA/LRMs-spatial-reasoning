PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints. NTPPi(x,y) implies that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is entirely contained within x without touching its boundary). DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Considering the spatial arrangement:
- z could be entirely outside x, leading to DC(x,z) (disconnected) or EC(x,z) (externally connected, touching at a boundary).
- z could partially overlap x without overlapping y, resulting in PO(x,z) (partial overlap).
- z could be entirely within x, either touching its boundary (TPPi(x,z), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x) or not touching its boundary (NTPPi(x,z), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x).

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(y,x), NTPPi(y,x), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would imply some connection or overlap between y and z, contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
