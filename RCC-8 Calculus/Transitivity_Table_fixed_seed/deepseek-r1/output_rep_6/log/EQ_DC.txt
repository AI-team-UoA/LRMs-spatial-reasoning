PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are spatially coincident and identical, and DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts, the relation between x and z must be the same as that between y and z. Since x and y are identical, DC(y,z) directly implies DC(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as the equality constraint forces the relation with z to be identical for both x and y.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
