PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary).
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (y and z are the same region).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the relationship between x and y directly applies to x and z. Thus, x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are excluded by the conditions (e.g., x cannot be disconnected from z since it is inside z; it cannot be equal to z since it is a proper part; it cannot be tangential because NTPP implies non-tangential).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
