PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. The constraints are:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected with no common points.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.

The possible relations for x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if x is positioned away from both y and z, such that there is no contact or overlap.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if x touches z at a point not on the boundary where y and z connect, ensuring no conflict with DC(x,y).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other. This can happen if x overlaps z in an area away from the boundary with y, satisfying DC(x,y).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary at a point not near y, avoiding connection to y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (i.e., x is inside z and does not touch z's boundary). This is possible as x is entirely within z's interior, away from the boundary with y, ensuring DC(x,y).

The following relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be equal, as this would imply a connection between x and y (via EC(y,z)), contradicting DC(x,y).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z cannot be a tangential proper part of x, as EC(y,z) would imply a connection between y and x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x, for the same reason as TPPiâ€”EC(y,z) implies a connection to x, conflicting with DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
