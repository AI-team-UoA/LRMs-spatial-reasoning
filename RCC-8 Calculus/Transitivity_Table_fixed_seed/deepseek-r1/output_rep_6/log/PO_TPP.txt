PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are as follows:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible if x shares some interior parts with z but is not entirely contained within z. For example, x could overlap y (which is part of z) and extend outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z. This can occur if x overlaps y near the boundary where y touches z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part is possible if x is entirely contained within z but does not touch the boundary of z. This can occur if x overlaps only the interior parts of y (away from the boundary).

The following relations are not possible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because x overlaps y, and y is part of z, so x must share some spatial region with z.
- **EC(x,z)**: External contact is impossible because x and y share interior parts, and y is part of z, so x must share interior parts with z, not just a boundary.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality is impossible because y is a proper part of z (since TPP(y,z)), and PO(x,y) implies x and y are not equal and neither is part of the other, so x cannot equal z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse tangential proper part (i.e., TPP(z,x)) is impossible because if z were part of x, then y (as part of z) would be part of x, contradicting PO(x,y) where y is not part of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse non-tangential proper part (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) is impossible for the same reason as TPPi; z cannot be part of x without violating PO(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.
