PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 spatial relations. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within y and shares a boundary with y. PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a proper part of the other.

Considering the spatial configurations:
- x could be entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z, leading to DC(x,z) (disconnected).
- x could be on the boundary of y where y and z meet but not in the interior overlap region, leading to EC(x,z) (externally connected).
- x could be partially within the overlapping region of y and z and partially outside, leading to PO(x,z) (partial overlap).
- x could be entirely within the overlapping region and tangent to the boundary of z, leading to TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part).
- x could be entirely within the overlapping region and not tangent to the boundary of z, leading to NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part).

Relations such as EQ (equal), TPPi (inverse tangential proper part), and NTPPi (inverse non-tangential proper part) are impossible because x is a proper part of y and cannot be equal to or contain z, given that neither y nor z is a proper part of the other in PO(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
