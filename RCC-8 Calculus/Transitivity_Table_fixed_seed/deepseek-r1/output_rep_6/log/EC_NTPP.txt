PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).  
- EC(x,y) indicates that x and y touch at a boundary but have disjoint interiors.  
- NTPP(y,z) indicates that y is entirely contained within the interior of z, without touching z's boundary.  

The contact point between x and y (from EC(x,y)) lies within the interior of z (since y is entirely in z's interior due to NTPP(y,z)). This implies that x must intersect z, as the contact point is part of both x and z.  

Possible relations between x and z:  
1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other. This is possible if x extends outside z while overlapping with z.  
2. **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part. x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z but adjacent to its boundary.  
3. **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part. x is entirely within z without touching its boundary. This is possible if x is strictly inside z.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. Contradicts the shared contact point inside z.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. Requires disjoint interiors, but the contact point is in z's interior, forcing interior overlap.  
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse relations (z part of x). Implies y is inside x, contradicting EC(x,y) (disjoint interiors).  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal. Contradicts NTPP(y,z) (y is a proper part of z) and EC(x,y) (x and y are not coincident).  

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP.
