PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies y is inside x and they share a boundary.  
Given NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This implies z is inside y without touching y's boundary.  

Since z is entirely within y's interior and y is inside x, z must be inside x. Because z does not touch y's boundary and y is tangential to x, z remains in the interior of x without touching x's boundary. Thus, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  

The relation between x and z is therefore NTPPi(x,z), as this is the inverse of NTPP(z,x).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as z must be a proper part of x (not DC, EC, PO, or EQ), and it cannot be tangential (not TPP or TPPi) due to its interior containment.  

### Answer:  
NTPPi(x,z)
