PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

- EC(x,y) implies x and y are externally connected: they share a boundary but have no interior overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y: z is entirely contained within y's interior and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x only contacts y at its boundary (with no interior overlap), x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

The only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
