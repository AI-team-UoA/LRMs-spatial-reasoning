PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if x is not located at the boundary region where y and z touch. Since x is entirely within y and y only touches z externally, x and z may have no contact.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This occurs if x is located at the boundary of y where y touches z. As x touches that boundary point, and z shares the same boundary point, x and z touch without overlapping.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- PO (partial overlap) is impossible because x is entirely within y, and y does not share interior with z.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi are impossible because x is inside y, while z is outside y, so no part-of relation exists.
- EQ (coincidence) is impossible because x is a proper part of y, and z is disjoint from y's interior.

Thus, the only possible relations are DC and EC.
