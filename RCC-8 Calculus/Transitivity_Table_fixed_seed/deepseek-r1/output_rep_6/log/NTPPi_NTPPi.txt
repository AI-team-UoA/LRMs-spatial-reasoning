PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), this means:
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, the non-tangential proper part relation is transitive. Therefore, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP (from x to z), TPPi, and EQ are excluded because z is strictly contained within x without touching its boundary, and z cannot be equal to x or have a different spatial relationship due to the transitivity and non-tangential nature of the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi.
