PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are spatially identical. Given TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. Since x and y are identical, z is also a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z), as TPPi(x,z) is defined as TPP(z,x).

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
