PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is strictly inside x without touching its boundary). Given TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary).

Since z is part of y and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z must also be a proper part of x. Specifically, because y does not touch the boundary of x (due to NTPP(y,x)), and z is contained within y, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, leading to the relation NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC and EC are impossible because x and z share interior points.
- PO is impossible because z is a proper part of x (not vice versa, and neither is part of the other is false).
- TPP or TPPi (for z,x) would require z to touch the boundary of x, but this is contradicted by y being NTPP of x.
- EQ is impossible because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x.
- NTPP (direct) would imply x is a non-tangential proper part of z, but this is inconsistent with z being part of x.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
