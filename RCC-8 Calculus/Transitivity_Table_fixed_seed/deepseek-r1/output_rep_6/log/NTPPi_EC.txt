PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected; they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.

Analysis:
- Since y is inside x (non-tangentially), the boundary contact between y and z must occur within the interior of x. Therefore, z must interact with x at this contact point.
- z cannot be disconnected from x (DC), as the contact point between y and z implies a connection between x and z.
- z cannot be externally connected to x (EC), because the contact point is interior to x, not on its boundary.
- z cannot be equal to x (EQ), as y is inside x and z touches y externally.
- If z were a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x (TPP or NTPP from z to x), this would imply TPPi or NTPPi from x to z, respectively. However, if x were a proper part of z (TPPi or NTPPi from x to z), then y (inside x) would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z), which requires no shared interior. Thus, TPPi and NTPPi (from x to z) are invalid.

Possible relations between x and z:
1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. z overlaps partially with x but extends outside. The contact between y and z occurs inside x, consistent with the conditions.
2. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x). z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. The contact between y and z can occur inside x without violating EC(y,z).
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x). z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely inside x and does not touch x's boundary. The contact between y and z occurs inside x, which is valid.

Thus, the possible relationships are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
