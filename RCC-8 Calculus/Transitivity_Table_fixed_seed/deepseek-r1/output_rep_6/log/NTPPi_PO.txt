PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary).  
Given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other).  

The possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:  
- Since y is entirely within x (NTPP(y,x)), and z overlaps y (PO(y,z)), z must share some interior parts with x (due to the overlap with y).  
- Therefore, disconnected (DC) and external contact (EC) are impossible because x and z share interior points.  
- Equality (EQ) is impossible because y is a proper part of x and z only partially overlaps y, so x and z cannot be coincident.  
- Tangential proper part (TPP) or non-tangential proper part (NTPP) from x to z (meaning x part of z) is impossible because z only partially overlaps y (which is inside x) and may have parts outside x, so z cannot contain x entirely.  

The possible cases for the relationship between x and z are:  
1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs if z has parts outside x. Since z overlaps y (inside x) and extends beyond x, x and z share interior points but neither is part of the other.  
2. **TPPi(x,z)**: Meaning TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. Since y does not touch x's boundary (NTPP(y,x)), z can overlap y and extend to touch the boundary.  
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Meaning NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary. Since y is not touching the boundary, z can overlap y and be contained within x without touching the boundary.  

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
