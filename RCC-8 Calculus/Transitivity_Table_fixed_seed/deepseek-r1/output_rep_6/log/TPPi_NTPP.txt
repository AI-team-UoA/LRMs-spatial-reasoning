PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs when x is part of z and touches z's boundary.  
  Example: y is inside x (touching x's boundary) and y is strictly inside z. If x is placed such that it touches z's boundary, while y remains strictly inside z, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This occurs when x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.  
  Example: y is inside x (touching x's boundary) and y is strictly inside z. If x is entirely contained within z's interior (no boundary contact), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

These are the only possible relations, as confirmed by the RCC-8 composition table, where TPPi composed with NTPP yields {TPP, NTPP}. Other relations (e.g., PO, DC, EC, EQ, TPPi, NTPPi) are impossible because x must be a proper part of z due to the transitivity of parthood and the constraints from y's relations.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
