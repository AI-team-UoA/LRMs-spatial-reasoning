PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. Thus, y is contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the constraints:
- y is inside both x and z.
- y does not touch the boundary of x but touches the boundary of z.

Possible relations:
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  
  - z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.  
  - y is inside z, so y is also inside x. Since y touches the boundary of z (by TPP(y,z)), and the boundary of z is entirely within the interior of x (as z is non-tangential to x), y does not touch the boundary of x (consistent with NTPP(y,x)).  
  - Valid.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap; x and z share an interior part but neither is part of the other.  
  - Both x and z contain y.  
  - The boundary of z touched by y is inside x (since y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary).  
  - z can extend outside x, crossing the boundary of x at a point away from y.  
  - y does not touch the boundary of x (consistent), and the overlap is partial.  
  - Valid.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Contradiction, as TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary, but NTPP(y,x) requires y not to touch x's boundary.
- **DC(x,z)**, **EC(x,z)**: Both require no shared interior, but y is shared.
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(y,x) for z and x variants**: Lead to contradictions with the boundary conditions of y relative to x and z.

Thus, the possible relations are NTPPi(x,z) and PO(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z), PO(x,z)
