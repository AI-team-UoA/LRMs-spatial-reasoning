PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. Given PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap: they share some spatial parts but each has parts not shared with the other. Since x is identical to y, the relationship between x and z is the same as that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is PO.

### Answer: PO
