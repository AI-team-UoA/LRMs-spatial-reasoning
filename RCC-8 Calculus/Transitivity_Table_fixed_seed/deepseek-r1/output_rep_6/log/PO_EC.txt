PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The composition table for PO and EC yields the following possibilities:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. Example: x and z are separated, with y acting as a buffer that touches z and partially overlaps x without bridging the gap.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. Example: x and z share a boundary point, where the overlap between x and y and the connection between y and z lead to direct contact.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. Example: x and z share some interior regions, possibly because x extends into the area where y connects to z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Tangential proper part inverse (equivalent to TPP(z,x)). Example: z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary, while y partially overlaps x and externally connects to z at that boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part inverse (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)). Example: z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary, while y partially overlaps x and externally connects to z at a boundary point inside x.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible. TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would require x to be entirely inside z, but PO(x,y) implies x has parts outside y, and EC(y,z) implies y is not inside z, leading to contradiction. EQ(x,z) is excluded because x and z cannot be coincident given the distinct relations involving y.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
