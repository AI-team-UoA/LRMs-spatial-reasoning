PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be consistent with the properties of these relations. Since EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions, the relation EC(x,y) directly translates to EC(x,z). This is because EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts, and replacing y with z (due to identity) yields the same relation: x and z touch at a boundary with no shared interior parts.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC(x,z) would imply disconnection, contradicting EC(x,y) and y=z.
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap, but EC requires no shared interior.
- TPP/NTPP/TPPi/NTPPi imply proper parthood, which EC excludes.
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but EC(x,y) implies x ≠ y (and thus x ≠ z).

Thus, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
