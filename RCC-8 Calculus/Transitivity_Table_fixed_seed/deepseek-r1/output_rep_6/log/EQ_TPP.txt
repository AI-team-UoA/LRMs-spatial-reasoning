PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical spatial regions, and TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is part of z and touches z's boundary), then x must also be a tangential proper part of z because x is identical to y. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- NTPP(x,z) is not possible because TPP(y,z) specifies that y touches z's boundary, and since x = y, x must also touch the boundary.
- PO(x,z) is not possible because TPP implies that x is a proper part of z, not merely overlapping.
- EQ(x,z) is not possible because TPP(y,z) implies y ≠ z, so x ≠ z.
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) are not possible because TPP implies a part-whole relationship with connection.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply that z is part of x, contradicting TPP(y,z) where y (and thus x) is part of z.

Thus, the only possible relation is TPP(x,z).
