PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are analyzed as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is spatially separated from both x and y, ensuring no common parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches a boundary of x that is different from the boundary shared with y, and y and z remain disconnected.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary at a point distinct from where x touches y, ensuring y and z share no parts.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x's interior without touching its boundary, so y (attached to x's boundary) and z share no parts.

Other relations are impossible:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap would imply a shared boundary point between y and z via x, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality would make DC(y,z) equivalent to DC(y,x), but EC(x,y) implies they are not disconnected.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x being a tangential part of z would cause the boundary point between x and y to be part of z, forcing y and z to touch, violating DC(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x being a non-tangential part of z would place the boundary point between x and y inside z, again forcing y and z to share a point.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi
