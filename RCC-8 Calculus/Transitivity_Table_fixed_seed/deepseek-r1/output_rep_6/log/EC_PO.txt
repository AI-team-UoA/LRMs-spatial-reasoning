PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by considering the spatial configurations. The analysis shows that x and z can be disconnected (DC), externally connected (EC), partially overlapping (PO), or x can be a tangential proper part (TPP) or non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of z. The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible because z cannot be a proper part of x (as this would contradict PO(y,z) and EC(x,y)), and x and z cannot be coincident.

Thus, the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
