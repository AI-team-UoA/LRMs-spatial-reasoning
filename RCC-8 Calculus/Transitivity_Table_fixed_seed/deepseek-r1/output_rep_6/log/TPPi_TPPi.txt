PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which translate to TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y) respectively:

- TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x: y is part of x, touches x's boundary, and y ≠ x.
- TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y: z is part of y, touches y's boundary, and z ≠ y.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be a proper part of x (z is part of x and z ≠ x). The possible relations between x and z depend on whether z touches x's boundary:

1. **If z touches x's boundary**: Then TPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).
2. **If z does not touch x's boundary**: Then NTPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible:
- In the first case, if z is positioned such that it contacts the boundary of x (e.g., through the same boundary point where y contacts x), TPPi(x,z) holds.
- In the second case, if z is entirely interior to y and not adjacent to x's boundary (e.g., touching an internal boundary of y), NTPPi(x,z) holds.

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- DC, EC, PO: Excluded because z is part of x (interior or boundary contact).
- EQ: Excluded as z is a proper part of x.
- TPP, NTPP: Would imply x is part of z, contradicting z being a proper part of x.
- TPPi and NTPPi are the only possibilities.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
