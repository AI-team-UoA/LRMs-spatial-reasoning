PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. The possible relations between x and z are:

- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal). This is possible if x and z are the same region, and y is a tangential proper part of both.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z contains x, and y is tangential to both boundaries in a way that satisfies the given relations.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x contains z, and y is tangential to both boundaries.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some but not all parts, with y in the overlapping region and tangential to both boundaries.

Relations DC, EC, NTPP, and NTPPi are impossible because:
- DC and EC require no shared interior parts, but y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior.
- NTPP or NTPPi would imply that y is non-tangential to x or z, contradicting the tangential nature of TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z).

Thus, the possible relationships are EQ, TPP, TPPi, and PO.

### Answer: EQ, TPP, TPPi, PO
