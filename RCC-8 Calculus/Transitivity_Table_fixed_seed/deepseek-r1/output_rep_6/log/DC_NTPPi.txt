PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch its boundary.

Since z is a proper part of y (specifically, strictly inside y), and x is disconnected from y (sharing no points with y), it follows that x must also be disconnected from z. This is because any spatial region of z is contained within y, and since x shares no points with y, it cannot share any points with z.

Considering all RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z): Possible, as explained.
- EC(x,z): Not possible, as z is not on the boundary of y (due to NTPP), and x is disconnected from y, so x and z cannot touch.
- PO(x,z): Not possible, as x and y share no parts, and z is part of y, so x and z cannot partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z): Not possible, as this would imply x is part of z, but z is part of y, and x is disconnected from y, leading to contradiction.
- TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, as this would imply z is part of x, but z is part of y, and x is disconnected from y, leading to contradiction.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible, as x is disconnected from y, while z is part of y, so x and z cannot be coincident.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).
