PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. Also, EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary point but no interior parts.

The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. Since y is part of x and z touches y at a boundary point, x and z must be connected; thus, DC(x,z) and EQ(x,z) are impossible. Additionally, relations implying x is part of z (TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)) or z is the inverse part (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) when z contains x) are impossible because y is part of x and z touches y externally, meaning z cannot contain x.

The possible relations are:
- **EC(x,z)**: If z touches x externally at the point where y meets x's boundary, and z is outside x.
- **PO(x,z)**: If z partially overlaps x, sharing interior points but neither is part of the other, which can occur if the contact point between y and z is on or internal to x's boundary and z extends into x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is inside x, touches x's boundary, and the contact with y is at a boundary or internal point.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is inside x, does not touch x's boundary, and the contact with y is at an internal point of x.

Thus, the possible relationships are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
