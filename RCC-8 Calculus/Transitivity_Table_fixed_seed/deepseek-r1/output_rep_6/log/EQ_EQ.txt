PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), meaning x is coincident with y and y is coincident with z, the relation between x and z must also be coincident. This is due to the transitivity of the EQ relation: if x and y are the same region, and y and z are the same region, then x and z must be the same region. Therefore, the only possible relationship is EQ(x,z).

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
