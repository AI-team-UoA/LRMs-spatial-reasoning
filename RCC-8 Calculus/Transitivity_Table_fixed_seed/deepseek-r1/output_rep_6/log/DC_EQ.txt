PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be disconnected (DC). This is because EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical regions, so any relation that holds between x and y also holds between x and z. Since x and y are disconnected (DC), x and z must also be disconnected. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as they would contradict the disconnection or the equality.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
