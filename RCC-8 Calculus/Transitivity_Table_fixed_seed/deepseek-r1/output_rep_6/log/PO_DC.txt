PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the interactions through y. Since y and z are disconnected (DC), they share no points. However, x partially overlaps y (PO), meaning x has parts inside and outside y. The part of x inside y is disjoint from z, but the part of x outside y may interact with z in various ways:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are entirely disjoint. This occurs if the part of x outside y does not intersect z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior points. This happens if the part of x outside y touches z externally without overlapping.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if the part of x outside y overlaps with z, sharing an interior region.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely contained within the part of x outside y and touches the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely contained within the part of x outside y and does not touch the boundary of x.

Other relations (TPP, NTPP, EQ) are impossible because:
- x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP) since the part of x in y would force y and z to share points, contradicting DC(y,z).
- Equality (EQ) is impossible as x and y partially overlap, but y and z are disconnected, preventing x and z from coinciding.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
