PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible if x extends beyond z while still overlapping y inside z. For example, x could share parts with y (which is inside z) but have parts outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. For instance, x overlaps y (interior to z) and extends to the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part is possible if x is entirely contained within the interior of z without touching its boundary. For example, x overlaps y (which is interior to z) and is itself confined to the interior of z.

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because x shares parts with y, which is inside z, so x must share parts with z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible because x shares interior parts with y (inside z), so it shares interior with z, not just a boundary.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal is impossible because x and y are partially overlapping (so x ≠ y), and y is a proper part of z (so y ≠ z), implying x ≠ z.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: These would mean z is a proper part of x, but if z ⊆ x, then y ⊆ x (since y ⊆ z), contradicting PO(x,y) where y is not a subset of x.

Thus, only PO, TPP, and NTPP are possible for the relation between x and z.
