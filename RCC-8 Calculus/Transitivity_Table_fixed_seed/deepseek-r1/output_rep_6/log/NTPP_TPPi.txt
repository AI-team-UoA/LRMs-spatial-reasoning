PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition. The constraints are:

- NTPP(x,y) implies x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(z,y) implies z is a tangential proper part of y, so z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since both x and z are parts of y, and x does not touch y's boundary while z does, the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This occurs if x and z are disjoint regions within y.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs if x and z are adjacent within y but do not overlap.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither is a part of the other. This occurs if x and z overlap partially within y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, so x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This occurs if x is inside z and touches z's internal boundary (not y's boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary. This occurs if x is entirely within z and in z's interior, away from all boundaries.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, but since z touches y's boundary, x would then also touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are the same region, but NTPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y) imply they are different (one touches the boundary, the other does not).

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
