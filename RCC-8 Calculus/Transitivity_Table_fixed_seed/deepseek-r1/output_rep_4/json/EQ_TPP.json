{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (identical regions), and TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z\u2019s boundary), we can substitute x for y due to their identity. Thus, TPP(y,z) directly implies TPP(x,z). There are no other possible relations, as the identity between x and y ensures that the relationship between x and z is identical to that between y and z.\n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 20.480724811553955, "reasoning-tokens": 257, "completion-tokens": 368}
