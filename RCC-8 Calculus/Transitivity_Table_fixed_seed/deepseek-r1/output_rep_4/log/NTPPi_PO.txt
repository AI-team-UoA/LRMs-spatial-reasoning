PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch its boundary. Additionally, PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap; they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.

To determine possible relations between x and z:

1. **Overlap Requirement**: Since y is inside x and y overlaps z, z must share at least some part with x (via y), ruling out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).
2. **Exclusion of EQ(x,z)**: If x and z were equal, then PO(y,z) would imply PO(y,x), but NTPP(y,x) (from NTPPi(x,y)) means y is a proper part of x, contradicting PO(y,x) (which requires neither is part of the other). Thus, EQ(x,z) is impossible.
3. **Exclusion of Proper Part Relations (TPP, NTPP) from x to z**: If TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) held, x would be a proper part of z. This implies y (as part of x) is a part of z, contradicting PO(y,z) (which requires y is not a part of z). Thus, TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible.
4. **Possible Relations**:
   - **PO(x,z)**: z may overlap x but extend outside x. Since y is inside x and overlaps z, and z is not entirely contained in x (due to PO(y,z) preventing z from being a subset of y or x), this is possible.
   - **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches its boundary). Since y is inside x and overlaps z, and z is entirely in x, this is possible if z is not a superset or subset of y (satisfying PO(y,z)).
   - **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x without touching the boundary). Similar to TPPi, this is possible if z overlaps y without being a subset or superset of y.

Thus, the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
