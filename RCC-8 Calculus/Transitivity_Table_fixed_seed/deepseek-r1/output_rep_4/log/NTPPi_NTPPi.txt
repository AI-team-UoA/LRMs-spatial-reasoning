PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch its boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This implies z is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch its boundary.

Since z is contained in the interior of y and y is contained in the interior of x, z must be contained in the interior of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

This is the only possible relation because:
- The transitivity of NTPP ensures that NTPP(z,y) and NTPP(y,x) imply NTPP(z,x).
- Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
  - EQ(x,z) is excluded because z is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of x, so x and z cannot be equal.
  - DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are excluded because z is contained within x, so they are connected and share interior points.
  - PO(x,z) is excluded because z is entirely contained within x, so x contains z as a part, meaning partial overlap (where neither is part of the other) cannot hold.
  - TPP(x,z) is excluded because z does not touch the boundary of x; the non-tangential nature of the containments ensures a "buffer" that prevents boundary contact.
  - TPPi(x,z) would imply TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x, but this is contradicted by the non-tangential containments.
  - NTPP(x,z) would imply NTPPi(z,x), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z, but this is impossible since z is contained within x and is smaller.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
