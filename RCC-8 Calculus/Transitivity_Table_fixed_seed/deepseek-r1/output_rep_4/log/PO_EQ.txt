PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (i.e., identical spatial regions). Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be the same as the relationship between x and y. Since PO(x,y) is defined as x and y sharing a spatial part but neither being part of the other, this directly translates to PO(x,z). No other relations from the RCC-8 set are possible because the equivalence of y and z preserves the original relation.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
