PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x: y is part of x, shares a boundary point with x, and y ≠ x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y: z is part of y, shares a boundary point with y, and z ≠ y.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z is a proper part of x (z ⊆ x and z ≠ x). The relation between x and z depends on whether z shares a boundary point with x:
- If z touches a boundary point of x (which can occur if the point where z touches y is also on the boundary of x), then TPP(z,x) holds, meaning the relation is TPPi(x,z).
- If z does not touch any boundary point of x (e.g., if z touches y at a point interior to x), then NTPP(z,x) holds, meaning the relation is NTPPi(x,z).

Other RCC-8 relations are not possible:
- DC, EC, and PO are excluded because z is part of x, so they are connected and share parts.
- EQ is excluded because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot equal x.
- TPP and NTPP (from x to z) are excluded because z is part of x, not vice versa.

Thus, the only possible relations between x and z are TPPi and NTPPi.

### Answer: TPPi, NTPPi
