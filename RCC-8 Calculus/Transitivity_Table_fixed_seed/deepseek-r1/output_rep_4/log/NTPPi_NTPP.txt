PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z must share at least the region y, meaning they cannot be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC), as these relations imply no shared interior parts.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. x and z share some interior parts (including y), but neither is a proper part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part. x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. y is deep inside x and z, so it does not touch z's boundary, satisfying NTPP(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part. x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. This is consistent as y is inside x and thus inside z without touching boundaries.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of TPP, equivalent to TPP(z,x). z is a tangential proper part of x and touches x's boundary. y is deep inside z and x, so it does not touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPP(y,x).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of NTPP, equivalent to NTPP(z,x). z is a non-tangential proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This is consistent as y is inside z and thus inside x without touching boundaries.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal. x and z are the same region, with y contained in their interior.

These cover all possible relations, as DC and EC are impossible due to the shared interior part y.
