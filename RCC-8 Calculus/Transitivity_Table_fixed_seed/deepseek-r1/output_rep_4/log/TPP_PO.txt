PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations allowed under the RCC-8 calculus. TPP(x,y) indicates that x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and shares a boundary point with y. PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being a part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected if x is located in a part of y that does not intersect z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected if x touches a boundary point of z without sharing interior points, which can occur at the boundary where y and z meet.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if x shares interior points with z but is not entirely contained within z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within z and shares a boundary point with z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within z but does not share any boundary points with z.

Relations such as EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would imply x = z, but since x is a proper part of y and z is not a part of y (from PO(y,z)), this cannot hold.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, but x is a proper part of y and cannot contain z, which is not a subset of y.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
