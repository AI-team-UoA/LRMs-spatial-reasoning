PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the RCC-8 composition table. 

- DC(x,y) indicates that x and y are disconnected and share no parts.
- TPP(y,z) indicates that y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary).

The composition of DC and TPP yields two possible relations:
1. **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z (no shared parts).
2. **EC(x,z)**: x is externally connected to z (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as confirmed by the standard composition table.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
