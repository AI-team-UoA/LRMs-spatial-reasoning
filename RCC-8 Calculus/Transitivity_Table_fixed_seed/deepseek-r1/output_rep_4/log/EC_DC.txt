PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by considering spatial configurations. The analysis shows that the following RCC-8 relations are possible:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, as z may be entirely separate from both x and y.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally, with z adjacent to x at a boundary not shared with y, ensuring DC(y,z) holds.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, but the overlap does not include the boundary where x and y touch, preserving DC(y,z).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z is inside x and touches x's boundary at a point distinct from the EC(x,y) boundary, avoiding contact with y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Here, z is entirely inside x without touching any boundary, so DC(y,z) is maintained.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(y,x), NTPPi(y,x), and EQ(x,z) are impossible due to contradictions with the given conditions (e.g., TPP(x,z) would imply z contains x and shares a boundary with y, violating DC(y,z)).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
