PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:  
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.  
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.  
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.  
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.  
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).  

These are all possible because the composition of EC with EC in RCC-8 includes these relations, depending on the spatial configuration. Relations like EQ, NTPP, NTPPi are not possible due to the boundary-touching constraints of EC.

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
