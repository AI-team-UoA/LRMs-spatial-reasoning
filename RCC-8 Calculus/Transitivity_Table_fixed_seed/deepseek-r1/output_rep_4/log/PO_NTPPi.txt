PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. The composition PO ; NTPPi yields the following possible relations for (x,z):

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but share no interior).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and does not touch x's boundary).

These cover all possibilities, as EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are impossible due to z being entirely within y and x not being contained within y (since PO(x,y) implies x has parts outside y).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
