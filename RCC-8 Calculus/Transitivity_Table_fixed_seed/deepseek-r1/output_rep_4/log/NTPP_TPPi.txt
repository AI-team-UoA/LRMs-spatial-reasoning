PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by their spatial arrangements relative to y. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (entirely inside y without touching its boundary) and z is a tangential proper part of y (inside y but touching y's boundary), the following relations between x and z are possible:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This occurs if they are separate regions inside y.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if they meet at a point or edge within y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other. This happens if their interiors intersect.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary (but not y's boundary, since x is non-tangential to y).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

The relations TPPi(x,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,x)), NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- z touches y's boundary, while x does not, so z cannot be a proper part of x (ruling out TPPi and NTPPi).
- x and z cannot be equal (ruling out EQ) since their boundary interactions with y differ.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
