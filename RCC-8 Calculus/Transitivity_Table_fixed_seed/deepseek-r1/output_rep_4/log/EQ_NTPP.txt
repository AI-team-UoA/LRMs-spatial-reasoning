PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region. Given NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z without touching its boundary. Since x is identical to y, it follows that x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
