PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary but no interior parts.
- Since x is strictly interior to y and does not touch its boundary, and y only shares a boundary with z (no interior overlap), x and z share no spatial parts and are not connected. Thus, they must be disconnected (DC).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- EQ, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EC would require some form of spatial overlap, boundary contact, or part-whole relationship, which is not possible under the given constraints.
