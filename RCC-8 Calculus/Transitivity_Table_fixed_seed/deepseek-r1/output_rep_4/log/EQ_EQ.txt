PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), this means that x is coincident with y, and y is coincident with z. Since EQ is an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, and transitive), it follows that x must be coincident with z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) would imply disconnection, but x and z share the same spatial region.
- EC(x,z) would imply touching at boundaries with no interior sharing, but x and z are identical.
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap without one being part of the other, but x and z are coincident.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) would imply that one is a proper part of the other, but EQ denotes equality, not proper parthood.

Thus, EQ(x,z) is the only possible relation.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
