PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which implies NTPP(z,y), both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. This means x and z are entirely contained within y and do not touch the boundary of y. The possible relationships between x and z include all RCC-8 relations, as their configurations relative to each other can vary while satisfying the constraints of being non-tangential proper parts of y. The possible relations are:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal).

All eight relations are possible, depending on the specific spatial arrangement of x and z within y.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
