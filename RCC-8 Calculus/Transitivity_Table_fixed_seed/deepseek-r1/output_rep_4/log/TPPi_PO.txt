PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs when z extends outside x, sharing some interior parts but neither being part of the other. Since y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y) implies TPP(y,x)), and y partially overlaps z, z may have parts outside x while sharing the overlapping region with y inside x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs when z is entirely contained within x, sharing a boundary with x. Since y partially overlaps z and y touches x's boundary, z must also touch x's boundary if entirely within x, satisfying TPP(z,x).

Other relations are not possible:
- **DC(x,z)** or **EC(x,z)**: Cannot occur because the overlap between y and z (due to PO(y,z)) ensures x and z share interior parts (as y is part of x).
- **NTPP(z,x)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Cannot occur because the overlap with y (which touches x's boundary) forces z to touch x's boundary if contained within x, ruling out non-tangential proper parthood.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Cannot occur, as z would then contain y (since y is part of x), contradicting PO(y,z) where y is not part of z.
- **TPP(x,z)** or **NTPP(x,z)**: Cannot occur, as x would be a proper part of z, but PO(y,z) implies z is not part of y and y is part of x, leading to contradictions.

Thus, the possible relations are PO(x,z) and TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
