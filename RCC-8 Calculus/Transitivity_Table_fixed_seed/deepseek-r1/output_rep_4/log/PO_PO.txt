PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z can be any of the eight RCC-8 relations. This is because the composition of PO with PO does not restrict the relation between x and z; all configurations are possible depending on the spatial arrangement of the regions.

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal).

Thus, all RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
