PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary. Additionally, DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no parts.  

To determine the possible relations between x and z:  
- **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely outside x, so x and z share no parts. Consistent because y inside x and disconnected from z remains possible.  
- **EC(x,z)**: z touches x's boundary externally but shares no interior parts. Since y is inside x and away from the boundary, y and z can remain disconnected.  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other. The overlapping region may avoid y, so y and z can be disconnected.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). y is inside x and away from the boundary, so y and z can be disconnected if they occupy non-overlapping regions of x.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and does not touch the boundary). Again, y and z can be disconnected within x.  

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:  
- **TPP(x,z)** or **NTPP(x,z)** would imply x is a proper part of z, so y (inside x) would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).  
- **EQ(x,z)** would make y part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
