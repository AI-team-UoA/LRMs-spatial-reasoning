PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is entirely contained within y and touches the boundary of y.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z is part of x. Because y does not touch the boundary of x, the boundary of y is entirely within the interior of x. Therefore, z touching the boundary of y means it touches a point in the interior of x, not on the boundary of x. Thus, z does not touch the boundary of x and is entirely contained within x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x.

This corresponds to NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC or EC would imply no shared parts or only boundary contact, but z is part of x.
- PO would imply partial overlap without one being part of the other, but z is part of x.
- TPP or TPPi would require z to touch x's boundary, which is not the case.
- NTPP would be from z to x, but NTPP(z,x) is covered by NTPPi(x,z).
- EQ would require x and z to be coincident, but z is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of x, so they cannot be equal.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
