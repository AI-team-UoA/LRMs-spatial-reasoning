PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- TPP(x,y) implies x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. Thus, x is entirely within y.
- DC(y,z) implies y and z have no common points (disconnected).

Since x is a subset of y and y has no points in common with z, x cannot share any points with z. Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

Other relations are impossible:
- **EC(x,z)**: Requires touching at a boundary, which would imply y and z share that boundary point (since x ⊆ y), contradicting DC(y,z).
- **PO(x,z)**: Requires overlapping interiors, implying y and z share interior points, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**, or **EQ(x,z)**: All imply x and z share points (either via containment or equality), which would mean y and z share points via x ⊆ y, contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
