PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- DC(x,y) implies x and y share no common points (disconnected).
- NTPP(z,y) implies z is entirely contained within the interior of y (z is a non-tangential proper part of y), meaning every point of z is a point of y.

Since x and y have no common points and z is a part of y, x and z cannot share any common points. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC (disconnected). No other RCC-8 relations (EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible, as they would require some form of spatial overlap or contact, contradicting DC(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
