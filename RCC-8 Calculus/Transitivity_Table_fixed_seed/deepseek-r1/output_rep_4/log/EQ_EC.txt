PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident and identical spatial regions. Since EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), and x is identical to y, the relationship between x and z must also be EC. This is the only possible relation, as the equality EQ(x,y) directly transfers the relation EC(y,z) to EC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z must touch (due to EC).
- PO(x,z) is impossible because there is no interior overlap (EC requires disjoint interiors).
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because EC implies no part-whole relationship (both regions are separate and equal in the sense that neither is part of the other).
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is distinct from y (and thus from x), as EC requires them to be different regions.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
