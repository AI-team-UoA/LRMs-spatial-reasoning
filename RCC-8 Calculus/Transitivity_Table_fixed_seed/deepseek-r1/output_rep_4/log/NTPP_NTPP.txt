PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z). This is because NTPP (non-tangential proper part) is transitive in the RCC-8 calculus. Specifically, if x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary, and y is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary, then x must be entirely within z and not touch z's boundary. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as all others would contradict the given conditions (e.g., EQ would imply equality, but NTPP implies proper parts; TPP would imply touching the boundary, but NTPP precludes boundary contact).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
