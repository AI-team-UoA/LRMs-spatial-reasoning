PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Also, EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions). Since y and z are identical, substituting z for y in TPP(y,x) gives TPP(z,x). This implies that the relation between x and z is the inverse of TPP(z,x), which is TPPi(x,z). Therefore, the only possible relation is TPPi.
