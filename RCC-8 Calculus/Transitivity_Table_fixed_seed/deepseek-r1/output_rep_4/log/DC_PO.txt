PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need to find the possible relations between x and z. The relations must be consistent with the constraints.

- DC(x,y) implies x and y have no common points.
- PO(y,z) implies y and z partially overlap: they share interior points, but neither is a part of the other.

Possible relations for x and z:

1. **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is entirely separate from both y and the overlapping parts of z.
2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. This can occur if x contacts z at a boundary point not shared with y.
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x shares interior points with z, but only in regions of z not overlapping with y.
4. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z (touching z's boundary) but entirely in a part of z disjoint from y.
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is strictly inside z (not touching the boundary) and in a part of z disjoint from y.

Excluded relations:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible because x and y are disconnected (DC(x,y)), but z overlaps with y (PO(y,z)), so x cannot equal z.
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Impossible because if z were a proper part of x, then z âŠ† x. Since PO(y,z) implies y and z share points, x and y would share points (contradicting DC(x,y)).
- **PO(y,z)** already excludes part relations between y and z (e.g., TPP, NTPP), so inverses are not applicable.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
