PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z using the RCC-8 composition table. NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

The composition of NTPP⁻¹ (which is NTPPi) and TPP results in the set {PO, TPPi, NTPPi} for the relation between x and z. Therefore, the possible relations are:

- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

These cover all possible consistent scenarios based on the given relations.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
