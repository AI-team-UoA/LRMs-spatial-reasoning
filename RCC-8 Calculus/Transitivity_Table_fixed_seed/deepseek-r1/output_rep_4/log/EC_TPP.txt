PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP. These can be explained as follows:

- **EC(x,z)**: This occurs when x is externally connected to z. For example, if x touches y at the point where y is tangent to the boundary of z, then x may also touch z at that same point, resulting in EC between x and z.
  
- **PO(x,z)**: This occurs when x and z partially overlap. For instance, if x touches y at a point interior to z (not on z's boundary), and x extends into z, then x and z share interior points but neither is a part of the other.

- **TPP(x,z)**: This occurs when x is a tangential proper part of z. For example, if x is inside z and touches the boundary of z, and also touches y (which is inside z), then x is a proper part of z and touches its boundary.

- **NTPP(x,z)**: This occurs when x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For instance, if x is completely inside z, does not touch z's boundary, and touches y at some point, then x is a proper part of z without boundary contact.

The relations DC, EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible because:
- DC is impossible since x and y share a point (due to EC), and y is part of z (due to TPP), so x must share at least one point with z.
- EQ is impossible because x and y are distinct and externally connected, while y is a proper part of z, so x cannot be coincident with z.
- TPPi and NTPPi are impossible because z contains y as a proper part, and x is externally connected to y, so z cannot be a part of x.

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
