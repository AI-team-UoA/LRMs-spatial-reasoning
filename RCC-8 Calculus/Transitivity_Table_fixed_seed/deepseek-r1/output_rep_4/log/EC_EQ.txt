PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts) and EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions), the relation between x and z must be consistent with that between x and y. Since y and z are identical, any spatial relation involving y directly applies to z.

Specifically, because x is externally connected to y, and y is identical to z, x must be externally connected to z. Therefore, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and y are connected, and y â‰¡ z.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because EC(x,y) implies no shared interior, which would be violated if x and z partially overlapped.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because EC does not imply that one is a proper part of the other.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible unless x and y are also identical, but EC(x,y) implies they are distinct and only touch at a boundary.

Thus, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).
