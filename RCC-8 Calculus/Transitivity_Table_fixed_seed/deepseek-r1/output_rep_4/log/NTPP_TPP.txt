PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary).
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is entirely within z and touches z's boundary).

We analyze the relationship between x and z:
- Since x is entirely within y and y is entirely within z, x must be entirely within z.
- Because x does not touch the boundary of y (due to NTPP), and y touches the boundary of z (due to TPP), x is set back from the boundary of z. Thus, x does not touch z's boundary.
- Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, leading to NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi are excluded because x is strictly inside z without boundary contact, and x â‰  z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
