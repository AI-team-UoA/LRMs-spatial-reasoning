PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x, y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and does not touch y's boundary).
- EQ(y, z): y and z are coincident (they are the same spatial region).

Since EQ(y, z) implies that y and z are identical, the relationship between x and z must be the same as the relationship between x and y. Therefore, NTPP(x, y) directly translates to NTPP(x, z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(y, z) ensures that y and z are indistinguishable in terms of spatial properties.
- NTPP(x, y) defines x as strictly inside y without boundary contact, and this must hold identically for z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
