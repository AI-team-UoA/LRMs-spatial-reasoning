PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident (identical regions). Given PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap: they share some spatial parts but neither is a subset of the other. Since x and y are identical, the relationship between x and z must be identical to that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation is PO(x,z).
