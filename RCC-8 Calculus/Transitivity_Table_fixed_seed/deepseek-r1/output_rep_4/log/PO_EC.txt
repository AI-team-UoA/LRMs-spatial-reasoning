PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of the RCC-8 relations. The composition PO â—¦ EC results in the following possible relations for x and z:

- DC(x,z): Disconnected. This occurs if x overlaps y in a region away from the boundary with z, so x and z share no common points.
- EC(x,z): Externally Connected. This occurs if x overlaps y near the boundary where y and z touch, causing x and z to touch at a boundary point without sharing interior parts.
- PO(x,z): Partial Overlap. This occurs if x extends into the region of z, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): Tangential Proper Part Inverse. This means z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)). It occurs if z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z without conflicting with PO(x,y).
- NTPPi(x,z): Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x)). It occurs if z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z without conflicting with PO(x,y).

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but PO(x,y) requires x to share interior points with y, which would force y and z to share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are identical, but PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) cannot hold simultaneously if x and z are the same region.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
