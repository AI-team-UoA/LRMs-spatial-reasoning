PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y without touching its boundary).  
DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (no common parts).  

- Since x is entirely within y, any part of x is also part of y.  
- Because y and z share no parts (DC(y,z)), x and z cannot share any parts.  
- Thus, x and z must be disconnected.  

Possible relations between x and z:  
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected (no shared parts).  
- Other relations are impossible:  
  - EC: Requires touching boundaries, but x is inside y and y has no contact with z.  
  - PO, EQ, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi: All imply shared parts or containment, contradicting DC(y,z).  

Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
