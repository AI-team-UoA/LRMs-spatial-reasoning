PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:

- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Since y is part of x and disconnected from z, x cannot be a proper part of z or equal to z, as this would imply that y is part of z or shares parts with z, contradicting DC(y,z). Therefore, the relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if z is completely outside x.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if z touches x's boundary at a point not occupied by y, as y and z share no parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping. This occurs if z overlaps with x in regions disjoint from y, but neither is part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is part of x and touches x's boundary, and is disconnected from y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary, and is disconnected from y.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
