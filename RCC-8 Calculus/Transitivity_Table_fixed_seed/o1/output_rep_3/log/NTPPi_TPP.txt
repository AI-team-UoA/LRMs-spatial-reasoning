PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z)

Explanation (informal sketch):  
• NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non‐tangential proper part of x, so y lies strictly in x’s interior (no shared boundary).  
• TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y ⊂ z with boundary contact between y and z.  

Because y’s boundary is inside x (no boundary contact with x) yet also coincides with z’s boundary, z’s boundary must lie (at least partly) inside x.  In RCC‐8 this forces either:  
1) z is wholly inside x (and may or may not share boundary with x), giving TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z); or  
2) z only partly lies inside x (their interiors overlap but neither contains the other), giving PO(x,z).  

Hence the only consistent relations between x and z are PO, TPPi, or NTPPi.
