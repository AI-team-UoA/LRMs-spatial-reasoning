{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "### Answer: NTPP(x,z)\n\nExplanation (not to be included in the final answer):\n\u2022 From TPP(x,y) we know x is a proper part of y and their boundaries intersect.  \n\u2022 From NTPPi(y,z) (\u201cthe inverse of NTPP\u201d), we know y is a proper part of z and their boundaries do not intersect.  \n\u2022 By transitivity, x is also a proper part of z.  \n\u2022 Because y\u2019s boundary lies strictly inside z (no boundary contact), and x\u2019s boundary lies on y\u2019s boundary, x\u2019s boundary cannot reach z\u2019s boundary.  \n\u2022 Hence x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z: NTPP(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 91.9618489742279, "reasoning-tokens": 10240, "completion-tokens": 10434}
