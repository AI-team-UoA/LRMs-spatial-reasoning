PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

Explanation (informal sketch):

• NTPPi(x,y) says “y is a non‐tangential proper part of x,” i.e. y is wholly inside x with a gap.  
• EC(y,z) says “y and z share a boundary portion but do not overlap in their interiors.”  

Since y lies strictly inside x (with no boundary contact), any boundary‐contact between y and z must occur strictly in the interior of x.  Consequently, x and z cannot be Disconnected (DC), Externally Connected (EC), or Equal (EQ).  What remains possible is that x and z either  
1) partially overlap (PO), or  
2) one is contained in the other (TPP or NTPP in either direction).  

Hence the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:  
• PO(x,z),  
• TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z),  
• TPPi(x,z) (= TPP(z,x)) or NTPPi(x,z) (= NTPP(z,x)).
