PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)

Explanation (not part of the final answer):  
NTPPi(x,y) says that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (y ⊂ x, with no shared boundary). Likewise, NTPPi(y,z) says that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (z ⊂ y, no shared boundary). Because y itself lies strictly within x and z lies strictly within y, it follows that z also lies strictly within x, again with no boundary contact. Consequently, z is a non‐tangential proper part of x, i.e. NTPPi(x,z).
