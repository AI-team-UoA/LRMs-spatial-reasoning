{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi\n\nExplanation (informal):  \n\u2022 TPP(x,y) says that \u201cx is a tangential proper part of y,\u201d so x is strictly contained in y and shares part of y\u2019s boundary.  \n\u2022 TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), so \u201cz is a tangential proper part of y,\u201d meaning z is also strictly contained in y and shares part of y\u2019s boundary.  \n\nHence x and z are both proper parts of the same region y (each touches y\u2019s boundary).  In standard RCC\u20108 geometry this allows x and z to be:  \n1) Completely disjoint (DC).  \n2) Meet only at a boundary (EC).  \n3) Partially overlap in their interiors (PO).  \n4) One be a tangential proper part of the other (TPP or TPPi).  \n\nBy contrast, non\u2010tangential containment (NTPP/NTPPi) is not possible here (because if one enclosed the other completely, they would also share the same boundary\u2010contact with y and thus be tangential rather than non\u2010tangential).
