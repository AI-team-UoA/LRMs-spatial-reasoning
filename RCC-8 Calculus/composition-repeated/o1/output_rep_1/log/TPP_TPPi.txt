PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi

Explanation (informal):  
• TPP(x,y) says that “x is a tangential proper part of y,” so x is strictly contained in y and shares part of y’s boundary.  
• TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), so “z is a tangential proper part of y,” meaning z is also strictly contained in y and shares part of y’s boundary.  

Hence x and z are both proper parts of the same region y (each touches y’s boundary).  In standard RCC‐8 geometry this allows x and z to be:  
1) Completely disjoint (DC).  
2) Meet only at a boundary (EC).  
3) Partially overlap in their interiors (PO).  
4) One be a tangential proper part of the other (TPP or TPPi).  

By contrast, non‐tangential containment (NTPP/NTPPi) is not possible here (because if one enclosed the other completely, they would also share the same boundary‐contact with y and thus be tangential rather than non‐tangential).
