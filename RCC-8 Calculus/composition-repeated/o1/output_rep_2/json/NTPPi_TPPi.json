{"prompt": "If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)\n\nExplanation (informal):  \n\u2022 NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y < x with no shared boundary).  \n\u2022 TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z < y and z\u2019s boundary touches y\u2019s boundary).  \n\nSince y < x with no boundary contact between y and x, and z < y with z\u2019s boundary touching only y\u2019s boundary, z must also lie strictly inside x (and cannot touch x\u2019s boundary). Therefore z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 62.77641153335571, "reasoning-tokens": 6272, "completion-tokens": 6473}
