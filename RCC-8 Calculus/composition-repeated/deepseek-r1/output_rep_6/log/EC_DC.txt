PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The composition table for EC and DC yields the following possibilities:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary).

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because:
- If TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z), then x inside z and touching z's boundary would imply that z and y are connected (due to EC(x,y)), contradicting DC(y,z).
- If NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z), similarly, x inside z would force a connection between z and y, contradicting DC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) (x and z coincident) is impossible because EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) would then imply that y and z are connected, again contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
