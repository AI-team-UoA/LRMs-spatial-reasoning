PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), which means x and y are coincident (identical in spatial extent), and y and z are coincident, it follows that x and z must also be coincident. This is due to the transitivity of the EQ relation. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z). No other RCC-8 relation (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) applies, as they all imply some form of distinction or partial overlap that is inconsistent with complete coincidence.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
