PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- EC(x,y) indicates that x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z) indicates that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

The point of contact between x and y lies within the interior of z, as y is strictly inside z (due to NTPP(y,z)). Therefore:
- x must have some overlap with z (since the contact point is inside z), ruling out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).
- x cannot be equal to z (EQ(x,z)), as y is a proper part of z but only externally connected to x.
- x cannot be the inverse of TPP or NTPP (i.e., TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)), as this would imply z is a proper part of x, conflicting with the containment of y in z and the lack of interior sharing between x and y.

Possible relations:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs if x extends both inside and outside z. The contact between x and y (inside z) ensures overlap, while x may have parts outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible as the contact with y (inside z) does not prevent x from also touching z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary. The contact with y (inside z) is consistent with this, as it occurs away from z's boundary.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
