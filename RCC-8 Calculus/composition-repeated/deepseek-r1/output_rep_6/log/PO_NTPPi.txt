PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other. NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

Considering these, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This is possible if x overlaps y in a region that does not contain z, so x and z share no common parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary point but have no shared interior parts, which can occur if x overlaps y near z without sharing interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other, which can happen when x overlaps y in an area that includes part but not all of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary, which can occur when x overlaps y and contains z, with z near the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary, which can occur when x overlaps y and contains z with z deep inside x.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and their inverses (other than TPPi and NTPPi) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be coincident, but x and z have different spatial extents due to PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a proper part of z, but z is a proper part of y and x is not contained within y (since PO(x,y) implies y is not a part of x), making this impossible.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
