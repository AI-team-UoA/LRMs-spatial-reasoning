PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):  
- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are coincident (identical regions).  
- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is part of y, touches y’s boundary, and z ≠ y).  

Since x and y are identical (due to EQ(x,y)), substituting y with x:  
- TPP(z,y) becomes TPP(z,x).  

Thus, the relationship between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).  

Therefore, the only possible relation is TPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
