PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The relations must be consistent with the definitions:

- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:

- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This occurs when x touches y at a point on z's boundary, and x does not share interior with z. For example, x is outside z and touches z at the boundary point shared with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs when x touches y at a point inside z's interior (not on z's boundary), forcing x to share an interior point with z, but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs when x is entirely within z, touches z's boundary (possibly through the contact with y or elsewhere), and x and y touch only at their boundaries without sharing interior.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This occurs when x is entirely within z, does not touch z's boundary, and touches y at a point not on z's boundary.

Relations that are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. Impossible because x and y share a boundary point, and y is part of z, so x and z must share a point.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a proper part of x (tangential or non-tangential). Impossible because if z were part of x, then y would be part of x, but EC(x,y) requires no shared interior, leading to contradiction.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal. Impossible as x and y are distinct and externally connected, while y is a proper part of z.

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
