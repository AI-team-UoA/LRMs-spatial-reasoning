PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). This is because NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary, and NTPP(y,z) means y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. Therefore, x must be entirely contained within z and cannot touch z's boundary, satisfying the definition of NTPP(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as x cannot be equal to z, partially overlap with z, or be disconnected from z, given the transitivity of non-tangential proper parthood.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
