PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we derive the relations:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This implies z is contained within y and touches the boundary of y.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be part of x. Specifically:
- Because y is strictly interior to x (NTPP(y,x)), the boundary of y is entirely within the interior of x.
- z touching the boundary of y means it touches a point internal to x, not on the boundary of x.
- Therefore, z is contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x.

This corresponds to NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as z cannot be equal to x (since y and z are proper parts), and z cannot be disconnected, externally connected, partially overlapping, or a tangential proper part of x due to the containment and boundary conditions.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
