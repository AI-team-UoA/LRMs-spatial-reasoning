PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relations between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table for TPP and TPPi. The composition TPP o TPPi yields the relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ. 

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally but share no interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are equal.

The relations NTPP and NTPPi are impossible because they would violate the tangency constraints of TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y). Specifically:
- If NTPP(x,z) and TPP(z,y), then x would be a non-tangential part of y, contradicting TPP(x,y).
- Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) and TPP(x,y) would imply z is a non-tangential part of y, contradicting TPP(z,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ
