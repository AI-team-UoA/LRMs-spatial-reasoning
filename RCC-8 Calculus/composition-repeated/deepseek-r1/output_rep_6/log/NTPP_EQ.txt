PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z is determined as follows:  
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y without touching its boundary).  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical (coincident regions).  
Since y and z are identical, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z. Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
