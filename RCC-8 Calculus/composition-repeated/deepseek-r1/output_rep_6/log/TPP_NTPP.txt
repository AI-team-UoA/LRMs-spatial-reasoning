PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.
- Since x is part of y and y is part of z, x must be part of z (transitivity of parthood).
- Because y is strictly inside z with no boundary contact, and x touches y's boundary (which is within z's interior), x cannot touch z's boundary. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are excluded because x is a proper part of z without boundary contact.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
