PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. Therefore, any relation involving y is equivalent to the same relation involving x. Since EC(y,z) holds, this means y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. Substituting x for y, the relation between x and z must be EC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC is excluded because x and z touch (due to EC).
- PO is excluded because EC requires no shared interior parts, while PO implies shared interior.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi are excluded because they imply a part-whole relationship with shared interior (violating EC's requirement of no shared interior).
- EQ is excluded because EC implies distinct regions (while EQ would require identical regions).

Thus, the only possible relation is EC.
