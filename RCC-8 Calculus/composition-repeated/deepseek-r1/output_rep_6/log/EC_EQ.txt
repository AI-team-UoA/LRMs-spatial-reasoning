PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

- EC(x,y) means that x and y are externally connected; they share a boundary point but no interior points.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are equal; they are the same spatial region.
- Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the spatial relationship between x and y directly applies to x and z. Therefore, x and z must be externally connected, resulting in EC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) is not possible, as x and y (and thus x and z) share a boundary point.
- PO(x,z) is not possible, as there is no interior sharing.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi are not possible, as neither region is part of the other.
- EQ(x,z) is not possible unless x and z are the same, but EC(x,y) implies x and y are distinct regions.

Thus, EC(x,z) is the only possible relation.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
