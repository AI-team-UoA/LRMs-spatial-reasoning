PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are all eight RCC-8 relations. This is because the composition of PO with PO in the RCC-8 calculus yields every possible relation. Below are examples for each case:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disjoint. Example: x and z are separate circles; y is a figure-eight overlapping both without connecting them.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. Example: x and z are adjacent squares; y overlaps both and their shared boundary.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. Example: x, y, z are three circles, each pair overlapping partially.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. Example: x is a small circle inside z touching its boundary; y overlaps x and part of z, extending outside z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Example: x is entirely inside z without touching the boundary; y overlaps x and part of z, extending outside z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. Example: z is a small circle inside x touching its boundary; y overlaps z and part of x, extending outside x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Example: z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary; y overlaps z and part of x, extending outside x.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. Example: x and z are the same region; y partially overlaps them.

Thus, all relations are possible.
