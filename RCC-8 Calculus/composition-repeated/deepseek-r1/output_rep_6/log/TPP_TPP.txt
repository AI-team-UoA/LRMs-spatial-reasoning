PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary. Similarly, y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary. Since x is part of y and y is part of z, x must be a proper part of z. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are limited to TPP or NTPP.

- **TPP(x,z)** is possible if the point where x touches y's boundary coincides with the point where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x touches z's boundary directly.
- **NTPP(x,z)** is possible if the point where x touches y's boundary is different from the point where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x does not touch z's boundary and is fully contained within z's interior.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, so x cannot be equal to z.
- DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because x is entirely contained within z, so they cannot be disconnected, externally connected, partially overlapping, or have z as a part of x.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP and NTPP.

### Answer: TPP and NTPP
