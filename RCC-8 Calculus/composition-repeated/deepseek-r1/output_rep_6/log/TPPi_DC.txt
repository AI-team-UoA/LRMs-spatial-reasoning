PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no parts.

Possible relations between x and z:
1. **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely outside x. Since y is inside x and disconnected from z, z can be disjoint from x.
2. **EC(x,z)**: z touches x's boundary externally but shares no interior. This is possible if z contacts a part of x's boundary not occupied by y.
3. **PO(x,z)**: z partially overlaps x but neither is part of the other. The overlap must avoid y (since DC(y,z)), and y being a proper part of x allows non-y regions for overlap.
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible as z can be inside x (disjoint from y) and touch x's boundary.
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x (disjoint from y) without touching the boundary.

Impossible relations:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would imply y is part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Would imply x is part of z, making y part of z (contradicting DC(y,z)).
- **TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x)**: Already covered by TPPi and NTPPi (since TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x), etc.).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
