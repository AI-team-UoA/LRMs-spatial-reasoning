PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z):
- NTPP(x,y) implies x is entirely contained within y without touching its boundary.
- DC(y,z) implies y and z are completely separate, sharing no points.

Since x is inside y and y is disconnected from z, x must also be disconnected from z. There is no possibility for x to overlap, touch, or be part of z because any connection would require y and z to share points, contradicting DC(y,z). Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
