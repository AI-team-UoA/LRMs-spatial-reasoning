PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x, shares a boundary with x, and x ≠ y. Additionally, PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap: they share interior points, but neither is part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs if z extends outside x but shares interior points with x (via the overlap with y, which is inside x). Example: x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (tangentially), and z is a circle overlapping y and extending outside x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This requires z to be entirely within x and touching x's boundary. Example: y is tangentially inside x, and z overlaps y and is tangentially inside x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This requires z to be entirely within x without touching its boundary. Example: y is tangentially inside x, and z overlaps y and is strictly inside x without touching the boundary.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Cannot hold because y is part of x and overlaps z, so x and z share points.
- **EC(x,z)**: Cannot hold because the interior overlap of y and z implies x and z share interior points (since y ⊆ x), but EC requires no interior points in common.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Cannot hold because y is a proper part of x, but PO(y,z) requires y is not part of z, so x cannot equal z.
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Would imply x is part of z, but then y (part of x) would be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z) which requires y is not part of z.
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Would imply x is part of z, but then y (part of x) would be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z) which requires y is not part of z.

Thus, the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
