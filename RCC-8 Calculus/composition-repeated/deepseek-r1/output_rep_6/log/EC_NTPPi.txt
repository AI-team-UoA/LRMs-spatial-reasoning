PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z). This is because z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary. Since x and y are externally connected, they touch only at their boundaries with no interior overlap. Therefore, x and z have no spatial connection, resulting in them being disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
