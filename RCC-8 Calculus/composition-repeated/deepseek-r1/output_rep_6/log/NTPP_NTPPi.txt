PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is also a non-tangential proper part of y. Both x and z are entirely contained within y, with no part touching y's boundary. The possible spatial relationships between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations, as there are no restrictions preventing any configuration within y. Specifically:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected with no shared parts.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (touching z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (not touching z's boundary).
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (identical regions).

All eight relations are possible under the given conditions.
