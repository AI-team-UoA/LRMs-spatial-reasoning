PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (the same region).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, NTPPi(x,y) directly implies NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
