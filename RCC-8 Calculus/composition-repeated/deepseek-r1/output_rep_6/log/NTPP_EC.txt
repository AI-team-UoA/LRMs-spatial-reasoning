PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).  

- NTPP(x,y) indicates that x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.  
- EC(y,z) indicates that y and z touch at their boundaries but have no overlapping interior parts.  

Since x is strictly interior to y and does not reach y's boundary, and y only touches z at the boundary, x and z share no common points. Thus, they are disconnected.  

No other RCC-8 relations (EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible because:  
- EC would require x and z to touch, but x is isolated from y's boundary.  
- PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi would imply overlap or containment, which is prevented by the disjoint interiors of y and z.  
- EQ is impossible as x is strictly inside y, while z is outside y except at the boundary.  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
