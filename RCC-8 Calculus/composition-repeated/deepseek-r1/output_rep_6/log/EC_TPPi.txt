PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected).

- DC(x,z) occurs if the point where x touches y is not on the boundary of z, meaning x and z share no points.
- EC(x,z) occurs if the point where x touches y is on the boundary of z, meaning x and z touch at a boundary point but share no interior.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- PO (partial overlap) would require shared interior, but x is external to y and z is internal to y, so their interiors are disjoint.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would imply part/whole relationships, which are inconsistent with x being external to y and z being a proper part of y.

### Answer: DC or EC
