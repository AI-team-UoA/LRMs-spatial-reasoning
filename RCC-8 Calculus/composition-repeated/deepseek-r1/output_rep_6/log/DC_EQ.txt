PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be the same as between x and y because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical spatial regions. Therefore, the relation DC(x,y) directly applies to x and z. Specifically:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible since EQ(y,z) makes z equivalent to y, preserving the DC relation.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
