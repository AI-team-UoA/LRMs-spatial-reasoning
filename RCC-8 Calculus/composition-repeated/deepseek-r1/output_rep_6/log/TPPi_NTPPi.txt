PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y ⊆ x and y touches the boundary of x).
- NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., z ⊆ y and z does not touch the boundary of y).

Since z ⊆ y and y ⊆ x, it follows that z ⊆ x. Because z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary, and y is tangential to x, z does not touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as z must be a proper part of x and cannot be equal to x, tangential to x, or have any other relation (e.g., disconnected, externally connected, partially overlapping) due to the containment hierarchy.
