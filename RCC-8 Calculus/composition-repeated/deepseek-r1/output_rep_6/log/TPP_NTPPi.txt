PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are determined as follows:

- Both x and z are proper parts of y: x is a tangential proper part (touching y's boundary), while z is a non-tangential proper part (entirely within y's interior).
- x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP) because x touches y's boundary, but z is interior to y, leading to a contradiction if x were inside z.
- x and z cannot be equal (EQ) because x touches y's boundary, but z does not.
- Possible relations include:
  - **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disjoint (e.g., non-overlapping regions inside y).
  - **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally at a boundary point within y's interior.
  - **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but not containing each other.
  - **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP; z touches x's boundary).
  - **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP; z is entirely within x's interior).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
