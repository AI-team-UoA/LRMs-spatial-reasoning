PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z):  
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x.  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).  

Since y and z are identical, the relation between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, TPPi(x,y) directly implies TPPi(x,z).  

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
