PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This occurs if x is a tangential proper part of y but does not touch the boundary region where y and z are externally connected.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs if x touches the boundary of y at the same location where y and z are externally connected.

Other relations are impossible:
- PO(x,z) is excluded because x is entirely within y, and y and z share no interior, so x and z cannot partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) are excluded because x is inside y, and z is outside y (only touching at a boundary), so x cannot be part of z or vice versa.
- EQ(x,z) is excluded because x is a proper part of y, while z is a distinct region.

Thus, the only possible relations are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
