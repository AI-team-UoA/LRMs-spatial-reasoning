PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be consistent with the spatial relations defined in RCC-8.

- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, so they represent the same spatial region.

Since y and z are identical, the relation between x and z must be the same as the relation between x and y. Therefore, x is also a tangential proper part of z.

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
