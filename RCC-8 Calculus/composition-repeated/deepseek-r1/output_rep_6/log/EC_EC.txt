PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. The relations DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi are possible, while EQ, NTPP, and NTPPi are not possible due to the constraints of external connection and the properties of the regions.

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected if they are on opposite sides of y and do not touch each other.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch each other externally if they both touch y and are adjacent to each other.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if they share some interior but neither is part of the other, with y touching both externally at non-overlapping boundaries.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z if x is part of z and touches its boundary, with y touching x externally at that boundary point.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP) if z is part of x and touches its boundary, with y touching z externally at that boundary point.

NTPP and NTPPi are impossible because if x were a non-tangential proper part of z (or vice versa), it would contradict the external connection with y without sharing interior. EQ is impossible because EC relations imply distinct regions.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.
