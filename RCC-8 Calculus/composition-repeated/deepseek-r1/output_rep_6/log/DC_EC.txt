PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The relations DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP are possible for x and z, while TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible due to constraints from the given relations.

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are disconnected and share no parts, which can occur if x is positioned away from z and not influenced by y's connection to z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch externally but do not share interior parts, which can happen if x and z share a boundary point not involving y.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other, which can occur if x overlaps with z in a region disjoint from y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches its boundary, which can occur if x is contained in z and positioned away from the point where y touches z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z but does not touch its boundary, which can similarly occur if x is contained in z and disjoint from y.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible:
- **TPPi(x,z)** (i.e., TPP(z,x)) and **NTPPi(x,z)** (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) would imply that z is part of x, but since EC(y,z) means y touches z, this would require y to touch x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **EQ(x,z)** would imply x and z are the same, but this contradicts DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) being different relations.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
