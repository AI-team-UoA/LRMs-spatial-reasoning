PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x, y), x and y are spatially identical. Given DC(y, z), y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. Since x is identical to y, x and z must also be disconnected and share no spatial parts. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x, z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EC would require boundary contact, but DC precludes any contact.
- PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi would require some spatial overlap, but DC means no shared parts.
- EQ would imply x and z are identical, but DC(y, z) contradicts this as y (and thus x) cannot be identical to z if disconnected.

Thus, DC(x, z) is the only possible relation.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
