PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the constraints:

- PO(x,y) indicates that x and y share some interior parts but each has parts not shared with the other.
- DC(y,z) indicates that y and z have no common parts.

Considering x and z:
- The part of x that overlaps with y (interior) must be disjoint from z because y and z are DC.
- The part of x not overlapping with y may interact with z in various ways, leading to the following possibilities:

1. **DC(x,z)**: If the non-overlapping part of x (with y) is entirely disjoint from z, then x and z have no common parts.
2. **EC(x,z)**: If the non-overlapping part of x touches z only at a boundary without sharing interior parts.
3. **PO(x,z)**: If the non-overlapping part of x and z share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other (since part of x is in y and disjoint from z, and z may extend beyond x).
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: If z is entirely within the non-overlapping part of x and touches the boundary of x (i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x).
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: If z is entirely within the non-overlapping part of x and does not touch the boundary of x (i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of x).

Relationships TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPP/NTPP(x,z) would require x to be part of z, but part of x (overlapping with y) is disjoint from z, violating containment.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible as x shares parts with y while z does not.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
