PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which means that x and y partially overlap, and z is a tangential proper part of y (since TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y)). The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the spatial configurations:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected, if z is entirely within the part of y not overlapping with x and not touching the boundary with x.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected, if z is entirely within the part of y not overlapping with x but touches the boundary of x.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping, if z is partially within the overlap of x and y and partially within the part of y not overlapping with x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of tangential proper part, meaning TPP(z,x), if z is entirely within the overlap of x and y and touches the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of non-tangential proper part, meaning NTPP(z,x), if z is entirely within the overlap of x and y and does not touch the boundary of x.

These cover all possible relationships, as EQ, TPP, and NTPP are impossible due to the constraints: z is a proper part of y, and x is not a subset of y (since PO(x,y)), so x cannot be part of z or equal to z.
