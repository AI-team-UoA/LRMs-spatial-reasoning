PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), the possible relations between x and z are derived from the composition of these relations. The constraints are:

- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and does not touch y's boundary).
- TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary).

Considering the spatial relationships between x and z within y:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are disjoint (e.g., x is in the interior of y, z is near the boundary, and they do not overlap or touch).
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch externally (e.g., x is inside y, z is at the boundary, and they share a boundary point).
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z partially overlap (e.g., x is partially inside z and partially outside, or vice versa, while both are within y).
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and z is inside y).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and does not touch z's boundary, and z is inside y).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). This requires a specific configuration, such as in a region y with a hole, where x is a ring inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is inside x and touches both the boundary of x and the boundary of y (through the hole).

However, **NTPPi(x,z)** (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) is impossible because if z is inside x and x does not touch y's boundary, then z cannot touch y's boundary, contradicting TPP(z,y). **EQ(x,z)** is impossible as x and z have different boundary interactions with y.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi
