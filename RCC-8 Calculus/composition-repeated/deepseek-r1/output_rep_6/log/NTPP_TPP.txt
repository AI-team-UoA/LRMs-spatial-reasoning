PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x, y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary).
- TPP(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is entirely within z and touches z's boundary).

Analysis:
- Since x is entirely within y (NTPP) and y is entirely within z (TPP), x must be entirely within z.
- x does not touch y's boundary (due to NTPP(x, y)). Because y touches z's boundary only at its own boundary (due to TPP(y, z)), and x is strictly interior to y (not touching y's boundary), x cannot touch z's boundary. Thus, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.
- The composition of NTPP and TPP yields only NTPP for the relation between x and z, as per the RCC-8 composition table.

Possible relation:
- NTPP(x, z)

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
