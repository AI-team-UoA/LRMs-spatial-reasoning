PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z include all eight RCC-8 relations. This is because the disconnections with y impose no constraints on how x and z relate spatially. Examples for each relation exist:

- **DC(x,z)**: x, y, z are three separate regions.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally but are disconnected from y (e.g., x and z adjacent, y isolated).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, both avoiding y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, both disconnected from y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, both disconnected from y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x, both disconnected from y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x, both disconnected from y.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are the same region, disconnected from y.

Thus, any relation is possible.
