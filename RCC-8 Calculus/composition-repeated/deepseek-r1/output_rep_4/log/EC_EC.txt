PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the RCC-8 composition table for the relations EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are DC (disconnected), EC (externally connected), PO (partially overlapping), TPP (tangential proper part), TPPi (inverse tangential proper part), and EQ (equal). 

- **DC(x,z)**: Example: x, y, z in a line, where x and z are separated by y.
- **EC(x,z)**: Example: x, y, z mutually touching (e.g., three adjacent regions in a triangular arrangement).
- **PO(x,z)**: Example: x and z partially overlap and both touch y at their boundaries.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Example: z is a larger region; x is a tangential proper part of z and both touch y externally.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Example: x is a larger region; z is a tangential proper part of x, with y touching both externally (e.g., during a "cutting" scenario where y is a tool).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Example: x and z are the same region, both externally connected to y.

The relations NTPP and NTPPi are impossible because they require x or z to be entirely contained without boundary contact, contradicting the external connection constraints.
