PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z must be determined. NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x must be entirely contained within z, making x a proper part of z. The key question is whether x touches z's boundary. Because x does not touch y's boundary (due to NTPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary only at specific points, x cannot be connected to z's boundary. This is because x is "insulated" within y and separated from y's boundary, hence also from z's boundary. Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z, leading to NTPP(x,z).

Other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z): Impossible because x and z share spatial regions (x is inside z).
- PO(x,z): Impossible because x is entirely within y and y entirely within z, so x cannot partially overlap with z.
- TPP(x,z): Impossible because x does not touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z): Impossible because this would imply z is a proper part of x, but x is smaller than y and y is smaller than z.
- EQ(x,z): Impossible because x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, so x cannot be equal to z.

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
