PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the relation between x and z must be DC(x,z). This is because:

- EC(x,y) indicates that x and y share only a boundary point, with no interior overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- Since z is strictly inside y and not touching the boundary, and x only contacts y at the boundary (with no interior overlap), x and z share no points. Therefore, they are disconnected.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- EC(x,z) would require x and z to share a boundary point, but z is not on y's boundary.
- PO(x,z) would require partial overlap, but x and y have no interior overlap, and z is inside y.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi would imply a part-whole relationship, which is not possible since x is outside y and z is inside.
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, which is inconsistent with the premises.

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer:  
DC(x,z)
