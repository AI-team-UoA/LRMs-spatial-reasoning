PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x.

Given TPP(y,z), so y is a tangential proper part of z. Thus, y is part of z and touches the boundary of z.

The possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, meaning x and z share some spatial parts but neither is a part of the other. This occurs when x and z overlap in a region including y, but x extends beyond z (since y is on the boundary of z and interior to x), and z may extend beyond x in other directions.
  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is part of x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary, with y on the boundary of z but interior to x (so not forced to touch x's boundary).

- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x. This is possible if z is contained within x without touching its boundary, with y on the boundary of z but interior to x.

Other relations are not possible:
- **DC(x,z)** and **EC(x,z)** are impossible because x and z share the region y, so they are not disconnected or externally connected.
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(y,x)** (but we need x and z), **NTPPi(y,x)**, and **EQ(x,z)** are impossible because if x were a proper part of z, it would contradict that y (interior to x) is on the boundary of z, leading to a spatial inconsistency.
- **EQ(x,z)** is impossible since y is a proper part of both x and z, so x and z cannot be equal.

Thus, the possible relationships are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).
