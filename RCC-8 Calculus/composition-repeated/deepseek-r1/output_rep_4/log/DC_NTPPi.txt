PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary). Since DC(x,y) indicates that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts, x must also be disconnected from z, as z is a part of y. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), as no other RCC-8 relations (such as EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ) are possible under these constraints.

### Answer:  
DC(x,z)
