PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations. According to the RCC-8 composition table:

- DC(x,z) is possible (e.g., x and z are disconnected, with y as a shared boundary point not affecting z).
- EC(x,z) is possible (e.g., x and z touch externally at a boundary point shared via y).
- PO(x,z) is possible (e.g., x and z partially overlap, with y facilitating the overlap at a boundary).
- TPP(x,z) is possible (e.g., x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z) is possible (e.g., x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary).
- TPPi(x,z) is possible (e.g., z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary).
- NTPPi(x,z) is possible (e.g., z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary).

The relation EQ(x,z) is not possible, as x and z cannot be coincident given the constraints. Thus, all relations except EQ are possible.
