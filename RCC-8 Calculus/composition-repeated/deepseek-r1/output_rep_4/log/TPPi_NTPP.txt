PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x: y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z: y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Considering the spatial constraints:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

To avoid contradiction:
- If x were tangential to z (TPP(x,z)), y touching x's boundary would imply y touches z's boundary, violating NTPP(y,z). Hence, TPP(x,z) is impossible.
- If z were a proper part of x (TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x)), y would be inside z, but y must touch x's boundary. However, y being non-tangential in z and deep inside z prevents it from touching x's boundary, violating TPP(y,x). Hence, TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are impossible.
- Disconnected (DC), externally connected (EC), partial overlap (PO), or equal (EQ) relations are impossible because both x and z contain y (so they must overlap), and y's specific positioning (tangential to x, non-tangential to z) rules out these cases.
- The only consistent relation is NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Here, x is entirely within z's interior, so y touching x's boundary does not violate y being non-tangential to z.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
