PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z):  
- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are the same region.  
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches zâ€™s boundary).  

Since x and y are identical (EQ), substituting y with x in TPP(y,z) yields TPP(x,z). Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is TPP(x,z).  

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
