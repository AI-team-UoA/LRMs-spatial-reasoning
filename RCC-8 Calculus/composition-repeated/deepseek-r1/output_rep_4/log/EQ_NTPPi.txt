PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), which means x and y are coincident (identical spatial regions), and NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y) (z is a non-tangential proper part of y).

Since x and y are identical, z being a non-tangential proper part of y implies that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), meaning NTPP(z,x).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and EQ are inconsistent with the given conditions.
- Specifically, z must be entirely within x, not touching the boundary, and not equal to x.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
