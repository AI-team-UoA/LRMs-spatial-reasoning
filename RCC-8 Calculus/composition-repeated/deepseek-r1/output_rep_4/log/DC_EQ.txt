PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x, y) and EQ(y, z), meaning x and y are disconnected, and y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions). Since y and z are identical, the relationship between x and z must mirror that between x and y. Therefore, x and z must also be disconnected, as they share no spatial parts. No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EC would require touching boundaries, but DC precludes any contact.
- PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would imply some spatial overlap or containment, contradicting DC.

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x, z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
