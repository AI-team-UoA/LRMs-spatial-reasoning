PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, meaning x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, meaning x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, meaning x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

These are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning:
- EC(x,y) implies x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior.
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary.
- Since x touches y at a boundary point internal to z, x must intersect z, ruling out DC(x,z) and EQ(x,z).
- EC(x,z) is impossible because the shared boundary point between x and y is interior to z, not on z's boundary, implying x must share interior or be part of z.
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because they would imply z is part of x, conflicting with EC(x,y) (as y would be part of x, sharing interior, but EC requires no shared interior).

Thus, only PO, TPP, and NTPP are possible.
