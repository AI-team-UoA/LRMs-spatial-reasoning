PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), we need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is part of x and touches the boundary of x).
- DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is completely outside x, ensuring no overlap with y or other parts of x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This can occur if z touches the boundary of x at a point not occupied by y, as y and z are disconnected.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z overlaps with x in a region not including y, since y and z share no parts.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. z can be a part of x that touches the boundary and is disjoint from y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z can be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary and disjoint from y.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are impossible:
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are identical, but since y is part of x, y would share parts with z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, implying y is part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, also implying y is part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
