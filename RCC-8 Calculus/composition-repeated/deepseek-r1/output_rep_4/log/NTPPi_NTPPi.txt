PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which translate to NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(z,y) respectively, we analyze the relationship between x and z:

- NTPP(y,x) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely contained within x without touching its boundary).
- NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely contained within y without touching its boundary).

By transitivity, since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary. This implies NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

The RCC-8 composition table confirms that the composition of NTPP (or NTPPi) with NTPP (or NTPPi) results only in NTPP (or its inverse, NTPPi). Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
