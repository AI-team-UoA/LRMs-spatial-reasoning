PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).  
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.  
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap: they share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other.  

Possible relations between x and z:  
1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible. For example, z extends outside x but overlaps with y (which is inside x), so x and z share interior parts but neither is part of the other.  
2. **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within x, touches x's boundary, and partially overlaps y (ensuring PO(y,z) holds because z is not part of y and y is not part of z).  
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within x, does not touch x's boundary, and partially overlaps y (again satisfying PO(y,z)).  

Other relations are impossible:  
- DC or EC: x and z must share interior parts due to the overlap of y and z (y is inside x).  
- EQ: Would imply x and z are identical, but y is a proper part of x and overlaps z, leading to contradiction with PO(y,z).  
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z): Would imply x is part of z, making y part of z (since y is part of x), contradicting PO(y,z) (which requires y not part of z).  
- TPPi(y,z) or similar: Not applicable as we are relating x and z.  

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.  

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
