PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).  
- EQ(y,z) implies y and z are identical regions.  
- PO(x,y) indicates x and y partially overlap (share interior parts but neither is part of the other).  
- Substituting z for y (due to EQ(y,z)), x and z must also partially overlap.  
No other RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible, as they contradict the properties of PO (e.g., EQ would require x=z, but PO implies x≠y and thus x≠z; part relations violate PO’s "neither part of the other" condition; DC/EC lack interior overlap).  

### Answer: PO(x,z)
