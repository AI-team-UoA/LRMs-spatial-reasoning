PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.  
- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region.  
- PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap: they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other, and they are not coincident.  
Since x and y are identical (due to EQ(x,y)), the relation between x and z is identical to the relation between y and z. Thus, PO(y,z) directly implies PO(x,z).  
No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:  
- DC, EC, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are inconsistent with the partial overlap (PO) requirement.  
- The relations are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, so only PO satisfies the conditions.
