PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other. DC(y,z) indicates that y and z are disconnected, sharing no points.

The composition PO ; DC results in the following possible relations for x and z:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but share no interior parts).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).

These are the only possible relations, as other RCC-8 relations (TPP, NTPP, EQ) are inconsistent with the given constraints. For example, if x were a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP), it would imply that y and z share points through x, contradicting DC(y,z). Similarly, EQ(x,z) would imply PO(y,z), contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
