PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The composition table for EC and TPP yields the following possible relations: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.  

- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs when the contact point between x and y is on the boundary of z, and x does not extend into the interior of z.  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other. This can happen in both cases where the contact point between x and y is on the boundary or inside z, and x extends partially into z.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z, touches the boundary of z at some point, and is not equal to z. This can occur if the contact point between x and y is on the boundary of z (with x entirely inside) or inside z (if x also touches the boundary elsewhere).  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z, does not touch the boundary of z, and is not equal to z. This is possible only when the contact point between x and y is inside z (not on the boundary) and x does not touch the boundary of z at any point.  

These relations cover all possibilities based on the topological interactions between x, y, and z.  

### Answer:  
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
