PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) holds, x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region. Therefore, any relation involving y and z must also hold for x and z. The relation EC(y,z) is given, meaning y and z touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts. Since x is identical to y, it follows that x and z must also touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts. Hence, the only possible relation between x and z is EC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) would require x and z to be disconnected, but EC(y,z) implies they touch, so DC is impossible.
- PO(x,z) would require overlapping without one being part of the other, but EC(y,z) precludes sharing interior parts, so PO is impossible.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi all imply a part-whole relationship, but EC(y,z) involves no such relationship, and EQ(x,y) does not introduce one.
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be coincident, but EC(y,z) implies they are distinct and only touch externally, so EQ is impossible.

Thus, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).
