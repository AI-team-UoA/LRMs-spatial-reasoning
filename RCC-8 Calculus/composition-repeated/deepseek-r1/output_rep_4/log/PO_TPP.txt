PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).  

- **PO(x,z) (Partial Overlap)**: This occurs when x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other. For example, if x extends outside z while overlapping y (which is inside z), PO(x,z) holds.  
- **TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part)**: This occurs when x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z. For instance, if x is contained in z, overlaps y, and shares a boundary point with z, TPP(x,z) holds.  
- **NTPP(x,z) (Non-Tangential Proper Part)**: This occurs when x is entirely within z but does not touch the boundary of z. For example, if x overlaps y and is deeper inside z (not touching the boundary), NTPP(x,z) holds.  

Relations such as DC(x,z), EC(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible:  
- DC and EC are impossible because x and z share interior parts (due to PO(x,y) and y âŠ† z).  
- EQ is impossible because PO(x,y) implies x and y are not coincident, contradicting if x and z were equal.  
- TPPi and NTPPi are impossible because they imply z is part of x, which would make y part of x, contradicting PO(x,y).  

### Answer:  
PO, TPP, NTPP
