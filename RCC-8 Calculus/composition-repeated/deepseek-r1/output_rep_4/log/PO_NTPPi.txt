PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 relations. The conditions imply that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (so z is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary), and x partially overlaps with y (so they share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other).

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, with no shared parts. This occurs if z is in a part of y that does not overlap with x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, sharing only a boundary point but no interior parts. This occurs if x touches the boundary of z without overlapping its interior, while still partially overlapping y elsewhere.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other. This occurs if z is partially within the region where x and y overlap, but not entirely contained in x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary). This occurs if z is entirely within the overlap of x and y and touches the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary). This occurs if z is entirely within the overlap of x and y and is strictly inside x.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because x cannot be a proper part of or equal to z, given that z is a proper part of y and x is not a subset of y. Similarly, TPPi(y,z) or NTPPi(y,z) are not relations between x and z.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
