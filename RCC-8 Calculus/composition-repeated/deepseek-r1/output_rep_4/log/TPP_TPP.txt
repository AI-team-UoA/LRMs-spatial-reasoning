PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z):  
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely within y, touches y's boundary, and is not equal to y.  
- TPP(y,z) implies y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely within z, touches z's boundary, and is not equal to z.  

Thus, x is entirely within z (since x ⊂ y ⊂ z), so x must be a proper part of z (i.e., either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)). The specific relation depends on whether x touches z's boundary:  
- **TPP(x,z)** occurs if x touches z's boundary. This can happen if x touches y at a point that is also on z's boundary (e.g., where y touches z).  
- **NTPP(x,z)** occurs if x does not touch z's boundary. This can happen if x touches y at an interior point of z (away from where y touches z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as x cannot be disconnected from, externally connected to, partially overlapping, equal to, or an inverse part of z (since x ⊂ z).
