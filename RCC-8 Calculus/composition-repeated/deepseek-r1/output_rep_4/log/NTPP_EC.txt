PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x, y) and EC(y, z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- **NTPP(x, y)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained within y and does not touch the boundary of y.
- **EC(y, z)**: y and z are externally connected, meaning they share a common boundary but no interior parts.

Since x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary, x is separated from any external regions by y's interior. The EC relation between y and z implies that y and z touch only at their boundaries, with no overlap of interiors. Therefore, x, being strictly inside y and away from its boundary, cannot overlap with or touch z. This means x and z must be disconnected.

The only possible relation is:
- **DC(x, z)**: Disconnected, as they share no spatial parts.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EC(x, z)**: Requires x and z to touch at a boundary, but x does not reach y's boundary.
- **PO(x, z)**: Requires partial overlap of interiors, but y and z have no interior overlap, and x is inside y.
- **TPP(x, z)**, **NTPP(x, z)**, **TPPi(x, z)**, **NTPPi(x, z)**: Require x to be part of z or vice versa, but z is outside y except at the boundary, and x is inside y.
- **EQ(x, z)**: Requires coincidence, which is impossible given the disjointness.

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x, z).

### Answer: DC(x, z)
