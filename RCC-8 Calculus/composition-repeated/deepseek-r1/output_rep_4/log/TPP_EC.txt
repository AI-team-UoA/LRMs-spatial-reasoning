PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).  

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if x does not touch the boundary region where y and z are externally connected. Since x is entirely within y and y touches z only at a boundary, x may not overlap or connect with z.  
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This occurs if x touches the boundary of y at the same location where y and z touch. Since x is a tangential proper part of y, it can share a boundary point with z without overlapping interiors.  

Other relations (PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi, EQ) are impossible because:  
- x is entirely within y and cannot extend into z (no interior overlap).  
- z is externally connected to y and cannot contain x (as z's interior is disjoint from y's interior).  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
