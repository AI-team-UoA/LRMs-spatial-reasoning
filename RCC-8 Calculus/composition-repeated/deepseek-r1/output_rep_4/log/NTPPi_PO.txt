PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) (equivalent to NTPP(y,x)) and PO(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs if z extends outside x but shares some interior parts with x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x, touches x's boundary, and overlaps y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x, does not touch x's boundary, and overlaps y.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC, EC: Ruled out because y is inside x and overlaps z, so x and z must share interior parts.
- EQ: Contradicts NTPP(y,x) and PO(y,z), as y would need to be part of both x and z without being equal to either.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z): Would imply x is part of z, but then y (inside x) would be entirely in z, contradicting PO(y,z) which requires parts of y outside z.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
