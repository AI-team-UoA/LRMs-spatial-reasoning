PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by considering the spatial configurations. Since DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected with no shared parts, and TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary), the following relations between x and z are possible:

- **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. This occurs if x is entirely outside z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x is externally connected to z, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if x touches z at a point not shared with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps with z, sharing some spatial parts but neither being part of the other. This can happen if x overlaps with a part of z not containing y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is a separate part of z from y, touching the boundary at a different location.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This can occur if x is inside z and disconnected from y.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are the same, but since y is part of z and DC(x,y), x cannot equal z.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is part of x, but since y is part of z, this would mean y is part of x, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
