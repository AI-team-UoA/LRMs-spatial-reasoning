PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs when z partially overlaps with x but neither is part of the other. This is possible because y is entirely within x (non-tangentially), and z touches y at a boundary point inside x, allowing z to extend outside x while maintaining contact.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x. The contact between y and z occurs inside x, consistent with y not touching x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Here, z is entirely within x and does not touch the boundary of x. The contact between y and z occurs strictly in the interior of x, satisfying both relations.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Cannot occur because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must intersect or be inside x.
- **EC(x,z)**: Cannot occur because the contact between y and z is inside x (due to y's non-tangential containment), but EC would require contact only at x's boundary, which is not the case.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Cannot occur because if x were a tangential proper part of z, z would need to extend beyond x, but the contact between y and z (inside x) would require part of z to be inside x, conflicting with x being part of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Similarly impossible for the same reason as TPP.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Cannot occur because y is a non-tangential proper part of x (so x and y are not equal), and z touches y externally, implying x and z cannot be coincident.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
