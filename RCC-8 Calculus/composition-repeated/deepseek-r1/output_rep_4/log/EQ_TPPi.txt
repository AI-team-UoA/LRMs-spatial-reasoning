PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the premises EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the relationship between x and z can be determined as follows:

- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical spatial regions (x ≡ y).
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), as TPPi is the inverse of TPP.

Since x and y are identical (x ≡ y), it follows that z is a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation from x to z is the inverse of TPP, which is TPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- z cannot be equal to x (EQ(x,z)) since TPP(z,y) implies z is a proper part of y, and thus z ≠ x.
- z cannot be disconnected (DC(x,z)) or externally connected (EC(x,z)) because z is part of x and shares interior parts.
- z cannot be partially overlapping (PO(x,z)) because z is a proper part of x, not merely overlapping.
- z cannot be a non-tangential proper part (NTPP(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)) because TPP(z,y) specifies that z touches the boundary, and this property is preserved when substituting y with x.
- The tangential aspect is fixed by TPP(z,y), so no variation to non-tangential is allowed.

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
