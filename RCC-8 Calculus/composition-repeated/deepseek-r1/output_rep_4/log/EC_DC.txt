PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the RCC-8 composition table for the relations EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z include all base relations except EQ(x,z), as equality would contradict the given conditions. The compositions yield:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected (e.g., x and y touch, y and z disjoint, x and z far apart).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally (e.g., x and z touch at a boundary not shared with y).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (e.g., x and z share an interior part disjoint from y).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (e.g., in configurations involving holes or complex boundaries).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (e.g., x strictly inside z without boundary contact).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z inside x and touching x's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., z strictly inside x).

EQ(x,z) is impossible because it would imply x â‰¡ z, leading to EC(x,y) and DC(x,y) (contradiction, as EC and DC are mutually exclusive).
