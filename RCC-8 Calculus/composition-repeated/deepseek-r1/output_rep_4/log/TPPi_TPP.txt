PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), which are equivalent to TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x: y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z: y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region, as y is a tangential proper part of both.
2. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs if x is inside z and touches the boundary of z, while y is inside both and touches their boundaries.
3. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, with y inside both and touching their boundaries.
4. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other. This is possible if y is in the overlap and touches the boundaries of both x and z.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible because they share interior parts (via y).
- **NTPP(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper parts are impossible because y touches the boundary of both x and z, so x and z must also touch at the boundary if one contains the other.

Thus, the possible relations are EQ, TPP, TPPi, PO.

### Answer: EQ, TPP, TPPi, PO
