PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x, y) and NTPP(y, z), the possible relations between x and z are analyzed as follows:

- **DC(x, z)**: x is disconnected from z. Since y is entirely inside z (NTPP(y, z)) and x has no overlap with y, x could be entirely outside z.
- **EC(x, z)**: x touches z externally. x could be outside z but share a boundary point with z, without overlapping y (as y is interior to z).
- **PO(x, z)**: x partially overlaps z. Part of x may be inside z (avoiding y) and part outside, satisfying no overlap with y.
- **TPP(x, z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z (touching its boundary) and disjoint from y (which is also inside z).
- **NTPP(x, z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z (not touching the boundary) and disjoint from y.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x, z)**: Would imply x contains y (since z does), contradicting DC(x, y).
- **TPPi(x, z) or NTPPi(x, z)**: Would imply z is part of x, so y (inside z) overlaps x, contradicting DC(x, y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
