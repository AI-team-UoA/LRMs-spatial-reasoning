{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "The relations EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) imply that x, y, and z are all spatially coincident. Therefore, by transitivity of the EQ relation, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 39.69917416572571, "reasoning-tokens": 715, "completion-tokens": 772}
