PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints of the RCC-8 calculus.

- PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap; they share some interior points but neither is a proper part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z) indicates that y is a non-tangential proper part of z; y is entirely contained within z and does not touch its boundary.

From this, the following relations between x and z are possible:

1. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs when x shares some interior points with z but is not a proper part of z, for example, if x extends outside z while overlapping the region where y is contained within z.
2. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs when x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z, while still overlapping y (which is inside z).
3. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This occurs when x is entirely contained within z and does not touch the boundary of z, while overlapping y (which is also inside z).

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Impossible because x overlaps y, and y is contained within z, so x must intersect z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Impossible because x shares interior points with y (which is interior to z), so x must share interior points with z, not just boundary points.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible because y is a proper part of z (from NTPP(y,z)), but PO(x,y) implies x is not equal to y and has parts outside y, so x cannot be equal to z.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Impossible because these would imply z is a proper part of x, but then y (as part of z) would be part of x, contradicting PO(x,y), which requires that y is not part of x.

Thus, the only possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP between x and z.
