PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and shares a boundary point with y.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is entirely contained within z and does not share any boundary points with z.
- Since y is strictly inside z (no boundary contact) and x is part of y, x must also be strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, resulting in NTPP(x,z).
- No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
  - DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are inconsistent with x being part of z.
  - TPP would require x to touch z's boundary, but this is prevented by NTPP(y,z).
  - PO would require partial overlap without one being part of the other, but x must be part of z.
