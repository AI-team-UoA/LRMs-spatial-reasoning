PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. Given EC(y,z), y and z are externally connected, meaning they share a boundary but no interior parts. Since x is identical to y, the relationship between x and z must be the same as between y and z. Therefore, x and z must be externally connected.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) would require x and z to be disconnected, contradicting EC(y,z) and the identity of x and y.
- PO(x,z) would imply they share interior parts, but EC(y,z) explicitly forbids shared interiors.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi require one to be a proper part of the other, which is not the case in EC.
- EQ(x,z) would make x and z identical, but EC(y,z) requires y and z to be distinct regions.

Thus, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).
