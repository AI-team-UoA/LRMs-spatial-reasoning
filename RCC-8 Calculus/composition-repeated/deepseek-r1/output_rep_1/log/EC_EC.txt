PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi. This is derived from the composition table of the RCC-8 calculus, where the composition of EC and EC results in these relations. Specifically:
- DC(x,z) is possible if x and z are separated and do not touch.
- EC(x,z) is possible if x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts.
- PO(x,z) is possible if x and z partially overlap but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z) is possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (x part of z and touching z's boundary).
- TPPi(x,z) is possible if z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).

Relations NTPP, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible due to the constraints of external connection, which involve boundary touching and prevent non-tangential parts or equality.
