PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)):

- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.
- TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, consider the relationship between x and z:

1. **DC(x,z) is possible**: If the boundary point where z touches y is different from the boundary point where x touches y, then x and z do not share any boundary or interior points. Since x is outside y and z is inside y, they are disconnected. Thus, DC(x,z) holds.

2. **EC(x,z) is possible**: If the boundary point where z touches y overlaps with the boundary point where x touches y, then x and z share a boundary point. Since x is outside y and z is inside y, they share no interior parts, so they are externally connected. Thus, EC(x,z) holds.

3. **Other relations are impossible**:
   - PO(x,z) is impossible because x and z cannot share an interior part (x is outside y, z is inside y).
   - TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because neither x nor z is part of the other (x is outside y, z is inside y).
   - EQ(x,z) is impossible as x and z are distinct and not coincident.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are DC and EC.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
