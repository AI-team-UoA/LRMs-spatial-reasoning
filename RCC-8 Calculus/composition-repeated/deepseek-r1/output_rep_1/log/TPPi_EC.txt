PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is part of x and touches the boundary of x), and EC(y,z), which means y and z are externally connected (i.e., they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if z is entirely outside x except for the point where they touch, which is the same point where y and z touch. Since y touches the boundary of x at this point, x and z share this boundary point but no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping. This occurs if z partially overlaps with x, meaning they share some interior points, but z is not entirely contained within x and does not contain x. This is possible because z can extend into the interior of x beyond the touch point with y, while still satisfying EC(y,z) (no interior shared with y).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is part of x and touches the boundary of x). This occurs if z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x at the same point where it touches y, satisfying EC(y,z) (external connection with y).

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. Impossible because x and z share at least the boundary point where y and z touch, which is also on the boundary of x.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal. Impossible because z is external to y (from EC(y,z)), while y is part of x, so x and z cannot be the same region.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. Impossible because if x were part of z, then y ⊆ x ⊆ z, so y would be part of z, contradicting EC(y,z) (which requires no interior sharing).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Impossible for the same reason as TPP(x,z); it would imply y ⊆ z, contradicting EC(y,z).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Impossible because if z were a non-tangential part of x, it would not touch the boundary of x, but since it touches y and y touches the boundary of x, z must touch the boundary of x, so it cannot be non-tangential.

Thus, the possible relationships are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).
