PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.  
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y: x is inside y, shares a boundary point with y, but is not equal to y.  
- TPP(y,z) implies y is a tangential proper part of z: y is inside z, shares a boundary point with z, but is not equal to z.  

By transitivity:  
- x is inside z (since x ⊆ y ⊆ z), and x ≠ z (as x ≠ y and y ≠ z). Thus, x is a proper part of z.  
- The boundary contact between x and z depends on the points of contact:  
  - If x contacts y at a point that is the same as where y contacts z, then x contacts z's boundary, leading to TPP(x,z).  
  - If x contacts y at a point not on z's boundary (e.g., where y is interior to z), then x does not contact z's boundary, leading to NTPP(x,z).  

Other relations are impossible:  
- EQ(x,z): x and z cannot be equal (as x ⊂ y ⊂ z).  
- PO(x,z): x and z cannot partially overlap (x is entirely within z).  
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z): x and z cannot be disconnected or externally connected (x is inside z).  
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z): z cannot be a proper part of x (since x ⊂ z).  

Thus, the possible relations are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
