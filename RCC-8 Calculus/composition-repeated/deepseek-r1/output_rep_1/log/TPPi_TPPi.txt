PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

- TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary).

This is because:
- TPPi(x,y) implies that y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z) implies that z is a tangential proper part of y.
- Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be part of x (transitivity of parthood).
- However, z may or may not touch x's boundary, depending on the spatial configuration:
  - If z touches y at a point that also lies on x's boundary, then z touches x's boundary, resulting in TPPi(x,z).
  - If z touches y at a point not on x's boundary, then z does not touch x's boundary, resulting in NTPPi(x,z).

Other RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, EQ) are not possible because z must be a proper part of x, and equality (EQ) is excluded since y is a proper part of x and z is a proper part of y.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
