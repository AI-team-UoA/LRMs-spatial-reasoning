PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we have:  
- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely inside x without touching its boundary).  
- NTPPi(y,z) implies NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely inside y without touching its boundary).  

By transitivity:  
- z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is entirely inside x.  
- Since z does not touch y's boundary and y does not touch x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary.  
- Thus, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x).  

Expressed as a relation between x and z:  
- NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **DC(x,z)**: Not possible, as z is inside x.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Not possible, as z is entirely inside x (no boundary-only contact).  
- **PO(x,z)**: Not possible, as z has no part outside x.  
- **TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z)**: Not possible, as z is non-tangential to x.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Not possible, as this would imply x is inside z, but z is inside x and proper (so x â‰  z).  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Not possible, as z is a proper part of x (since z is inside y and y is a proper part of x).  

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPPi(x,z).
