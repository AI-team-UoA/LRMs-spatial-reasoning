PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z.  
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely inside x without touching its boundary).  
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no parts.  

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:  
1. **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. Since y is inside x and disconnected from z, z could be entirely outside x.  
2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. z could be outside x but touching its boundary, while y (inside x) remains disconnected from z.  
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. The overlap can avoid y's region, maintaining DC(y,z).  
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches its boundary). y can be placed away from z inside x, preserving DC(y,z).  
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x without touching its boundary). y and z can be disjoint regions inside x.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is inside z, forcing y inside z and violating DC(y,z).  
- EQ(x,z) would make x and z identical, but y inside x contradicts DC(y,z).  

Thus, the possible relations are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
