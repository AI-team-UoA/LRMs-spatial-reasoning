PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the spatial relation between x and z can be determined as follows:

- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (i.e., identical regions).
- Therefore, the relation between x and z must be identical to the relation between x and y.
- Since EC(x,y) holds (x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), it follows that EC(x,z) must hold for x and z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) would imply disconnection, but EC requires connection.
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap, which EC excludes.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) would imply part-hood, which EC does not involve.
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are equal, but EC(x,y) implies x and y are distinct.

Thus, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
