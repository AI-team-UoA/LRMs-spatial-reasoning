PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y ⊆ x, y touches the boundary of x, and y ≠ x).  
Given NTPP(y,z), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y ⊆ z, y does not touch the boundary of z, and y ≠ z).  

The possible relations between x and z are:  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x ⊆ z, x touches the boundary of z, and x ≠ z. The point where y touches the boundary of x may not coincide with the point where x touches the boundary of z, so y does not necessarily touch the boundary of z, satisfying NTPP(y,z).  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x ⊆ z, x does not touch the boundary of z, and x ≠ z. Since y touches the boundary of x and x is entirely within the interior of z, y does not touch the boundary of z, satisfying NTPP(y,z).  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Contradiction because y touches the boundary of x but not z, yet x and z being equal would require consistent boundary conditions.  
- **DC(x,z)**, **EC(x,z)**: Contradiction because y is a common part of x and z, so they must overlap.  
- **PO(x,z)**: Contradiction due to boundary conflicts; y touching the boundary of x while being interior to z leads to inconsistencies.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: Contradiction because if z were a proper part of x, y (inside z) could not touch the boundary of x.  

Thus, only TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible.
