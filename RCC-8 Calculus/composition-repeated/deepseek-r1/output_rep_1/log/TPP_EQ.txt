PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the given relations:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This implies that x is part of y, they share a boundary, and x is not equal to y.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they are the same spatial region.

Since y and z are identical due to EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be the same as that between x and y. Therefore, TPP(x,y) directly implies TPP(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- x must be a proper part of z (so DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPPi, NTPPi are excluded).
- x must touch z's boundary (so NTPP is excluded).

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
