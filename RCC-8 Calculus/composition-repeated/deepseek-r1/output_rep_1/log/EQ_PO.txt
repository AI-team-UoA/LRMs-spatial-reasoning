PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), the relation between x and z is determined as follows:  
- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are identical regions.  
- PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap (share parts but neither is fully contained in the other).  
- Since x is identical to y, substituting x for y yields PO(x,z).  

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is PO(x,z).  

### Answer: PO(x,z)
