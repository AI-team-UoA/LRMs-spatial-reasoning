PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is completely inside x and does not touch its boundary). TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is part of z and touches z's boundary).

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, where x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is part of x and touches x's boundary; equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary; equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).

These relations are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning:
- PO(x,z) is possible when x and z overlap partially, with y in the shared interior touching z's boundary.
- TPP(x,z) is possible when x is part of z and tangential, allowing y to touch z's boundary while inside x.
- TPPi(x,z) is possible when z is part of x and tangential, with y touching z's boundary inside x.
- NTPPi(x,z) is possible when z is completely inside x (non-tangential), with y touching z's boundary within x's interior.

Relations such as DC, EC, EQ, and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because:
- DC and EC are excluded since y is part of both x and z, requiring overlap.
- EQ is impossible because y is a proper part of both x and z, preventing equality.
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible because it would imply x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, contradicting TPP(y,z) which requires y to touch z's boundary.

Thus, the possible relationships are PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi
