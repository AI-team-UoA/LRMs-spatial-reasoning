PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the relationship between x and z.

- NTPP(x,y) implies x is entirely within the interior of y, not touching y's boundary, and x ≠ y.
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is entirely within the interior of z, not touching z's boundary, and y ≠ z.

Thus, x must be entirely within the interior of z, not touching z's boundary (since x is inside y and y is inside z, both without boundary contact). Additionally, x cannot equal z because x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

Other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z): Requires no spatial overlap, but x is inside z.
- EC(x,z): Requires touching only at boundaries, but x is entirely inside z.
- PO(x,z): Requires partial overlap without one being part of the other, but x is entirely within z.
- TPP(x,z): Requires x touching z's boundary, but x is interior to z (non-tangential).
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z): Imply z is a proper part of x, which is impossible since x is inside z.
- EQ(x,z): Requires x and z to be coincident, but x is a proper part of z.

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).
