PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x.  
Given NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y.  

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it does not touch y's boundary and is strictly interior to y. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, it touches x's boundary but is interior to x except at the boundary points.  

Because z is strictly interior to y and y is part of x, z must be strictly interior to x and cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:  
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so x, y, and z are distinct.  
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) are impossible because z is contained within x.  
- PO(x,z) is impossible because z is entirely contained within x.  
- TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) would imply x is part of z or z is tangential to x, but z is strictly interior to x.  
- NTPP(x,z) would imply x is part of z, which is not possible.  

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
