PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within x, does not touch x's boundary, and x ≠ y.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the relationship between x and y directly applies to x and z:
- NTPP(y,x) implies NTPP(z,x) (substituting z for y).
- NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but NTPP(z,x) implies x ≠ z.
- DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPP(x,z) are inconsistent with z being a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., DC, EC, PO imply no containment; TPP, TPPi, NTPP imply incorrect containment or tangency).

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
