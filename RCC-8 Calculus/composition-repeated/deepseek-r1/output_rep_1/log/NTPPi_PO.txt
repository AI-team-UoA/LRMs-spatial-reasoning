PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within the interior of x, with no boundary contact. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z must account for the spatial constraints:
- Since y is inside x, and z overlaps y, x and z must share some interior region, ruling out DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected).
- EQ (equal) is impossible because if x = z, then NTPP(y,x) and PO(y,z) would imply NTPP(y,x) and PO(y,x), but NTPP implies y is a proper part of x, while PO implies neither is part of the other, a contradiction.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a proper part of z, implying y is part of z (since y is part of x), but PO(y,z) requires that y is not a proper part of z, another contradiction.

The possible relations are:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. For example, z overlaps y (which is inside x) but extends outside x, so x and z share parts but neither is contained in the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. For example, z is entirely within x, overlaps y, and touches the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For example, z is entirely within the interior of x, overlaps y, and does not touch the boundary of x.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
PO, TPPi, NTPPi
