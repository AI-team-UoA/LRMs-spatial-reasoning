PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints. Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary), and x partially overlaps with y (x and y share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other), the following relations between x and z are possible:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, with no shared parts. This occurs if x does not intersect z or its boundary, for example, if the overlap between x and y is disjoint from z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if x touches z at a boundary point without overlapping its interior, even though z is in the interior of y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other. This occurs if x and z intersect in their interiors, but z is not entirely contained within x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This happens if z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but z is contained within y, and PO(x,y) means x is not entirely within y (it has parts outside y), so x cannot be a subset of z.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical, but PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y) imply different spatial extents, making equality impossible.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
