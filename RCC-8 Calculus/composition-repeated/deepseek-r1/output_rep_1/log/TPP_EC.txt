PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) or EC(x,z). This is because:
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is inside y and shares a boundary with y.
- EC(y,z) implies y and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary but no interior parts.
- Since the interior of x is contained within the interior of y (from TPP(x,y)), and the interior of y is disjoint from the interior of z (from EC(y,z)), the interior of x must be disjoint from the interior of z. Therefore, no relations involving shared interiors (PO, EQ, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) are possible.
- Depending on whether x is located at the boundary where y and z connect:
  - If x is at the connection boundary, x and z may be externally connected (EC(x,z)).
  - If x is not at the connection boundary, x and z may be disconnected (DC(x,z)).

### Answer:  
DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)
