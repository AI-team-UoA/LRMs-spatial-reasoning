PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z is determined by the fact that EQ(y,z) implies y and z are identical regions. Therefore, the relation between x and z must be the same as that between x and y, which is PO(x,y). Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z)
