PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident (identical regions). Given NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary). Since x and y are identical, the relationship between x and z is the same as that between y and z. Thus, x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
