PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, so they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- Since x is inside y and does not touch y's boundary, and y only touches z at its boundary with no interior sharing, x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected, meaning DC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EC(x,z) is impossible because x does not touch y's boundary, so it cannot touch z.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because x is entirely within y, and y and z share no interior, so x and z cannot share any interior parts.
- TPP or NTPP relations would imply x is part of z, but x is part of y and z is separate from y.
- TPPi or NTPPi relations would imply z is part of x, which is impossible since z is outside y and x is inside y.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible as x and z are distinct regions with no overlap.

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
