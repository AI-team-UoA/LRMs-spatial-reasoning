{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region. Thus, any relation involving y can be directly applied to x. Since EC(y,z) holds (y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), substituting x for y gives EC(x,z). Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 15.91014575958252, "reasoning-tokens": 199, "completion-tokens": 285}
