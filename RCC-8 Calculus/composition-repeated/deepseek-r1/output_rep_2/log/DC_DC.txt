PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z can be any of the eight RCC-8 relations. This is because the disconnection of both x and z from y does not impose any constraints on how x and z relate to each other spatially. They can be disconnected, externally connected, partially overlapping, related by proper parthood (tangential or non-tangential, in either direction), or even coincident.

The possible relations are:
- DC(x,z) (disconnected)
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,z) (coincident)

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
