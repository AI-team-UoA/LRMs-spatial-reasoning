PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- **PO(x,y)**: x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **NTPP(y,z)**: y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

The part of x overlapping with y is inside z (since y is inside z). The part of x not overlapping with y may either be:
  - Entirely within z (possibly touching or not touching z's boundary).
  - Partially outside z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. **PO(x,z)**: If x extends outside z (i.e., the non-overlapping part of x with y is outside z).
2. **TPP(x,z)**: If x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
3. **NTPP(x,z)**: If x is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)** or **EC(x,z)**: Not possible because x and z share interior parts (via y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Not possible because x and y partially overlap while y is strictly inside z, so x cannot equal z.
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Not possible because if z were a proper part of x, then y (inside z) would be a part of x, contradicting PO(x,y) where neither is part of the other.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
