PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (touch at boundary but no interior overlap).
- TPPi(y,z): equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary).

To determine possible relations between x and z:

1. **z is inside y**: Since TPP(z,y) holds, z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. **x is outside y**: EC(x,y) implies x and y share no interior points, so x is disjoint from y except at the boundary contact point.

### Analysis of x and z:
- **No interior overlap**: The interior of z lies entirely within y, while x has no interior overlap with y. Thus, x and z cannot share interior points, ruling out PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.
- **Possible contact at boundary**: 
  - If the boundary point where z touches y is the same as where x touches y, then x and z may touch at that point (EC(x,z)).
  - If z touches y at a different boundary point than where x touches y, then x and z do not touch (DC(x,z)).

### Possible relations:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected (no contact).
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected (touch at boundary but no interior overlap).

### Excluded relations:
- PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ are impossible due to the spatial constraints (no interior overlap, and x cannot be part of z or vice versa).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z)

### Final Answer:
DC(x,z) and EC(x,z)
