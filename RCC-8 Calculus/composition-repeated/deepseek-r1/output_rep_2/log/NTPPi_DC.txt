PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x, with no contact at x's boundary. Additionally, DC(y,z) indicates y and z are disconnected and share no points.

To determine possible relations between x and z:

1. **DC(x,z)**: Possible if z is entirely outside x. Since y is inside x and z is outside, DC(y,z) holds, and DC(x,z) follows.
2. **EC(x,z)**: Possible if z touches x's boundary externally. y is inside x without touching the boundary, so z and y remain disconnected.
3. **PO(x,z)**: Possible if z partially overlaps x but not y. For example, z overlaps a region of x away from y, ensuring DC(y,z).
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. z is entirely inside x, touching x's boundary, and can be placed away from y, satisfying DC(y,z).
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary, and can be disjoint from y.

Impossible relations:
- **TPP(x,z)**: Would imply x is part of z, but then y (inside x) would be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Similarly, x inside z implies y inside z, violating DC(y,z).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would make x and z identical, but y inside x contradicts DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
