PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. This means that x and z are entirely contained within y and do not touch the boundary of y. The possible relationships between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations, as there are no additional constraints that prevent any specific relation. The composition of NTPP and NTPPi allows for all eight relations between x and z.

The possible relationships are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPP(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
