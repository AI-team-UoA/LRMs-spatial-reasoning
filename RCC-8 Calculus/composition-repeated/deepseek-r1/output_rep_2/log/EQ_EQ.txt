PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), this means that x and y are spatially coincident (identical), and y and z are spatially coincident. By the transitivity of the EQ relation in the RCC-8 calculus, x and z must also be spatially coincident. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
