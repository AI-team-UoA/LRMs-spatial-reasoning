PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which translate to:
- NTPPi(x,y) ≡ NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) ≡ NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since NTPP is transitive, NTPP(z,y) and NTPP(y,x) imply NTPP(z,x). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- z must be entirely within x due to the containment.
- z cannot touch the boundary of x because both NTPP relations imply no boundary contact.
- Equality or partial overlap is impossible since NTPP denotes a proper part relationship.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)
