PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The composition PO o NTPPi yields the following possible relations:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if z is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary. This occurs if z is in the non-overlapping part of y but touches the boundary of the overlapping region (which is part of x).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs if z is partially in the overlapping region of x and y and partially in the non-overlapping part of y (with respect to x), sharing interior parts.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and does not touch the boundary of x.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because x has parts outside y (due to PO(x,y)), while z is entirely within y (due to NTPP(z,y)), so x cannot be a proper part of z or equal to z.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
