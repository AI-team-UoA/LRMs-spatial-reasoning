PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).
- NTPP(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z without touching its boundary).

We need to find possible relations between x and z.

### Analysis:
1. **Constraints**:
   - y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y, z)), so y shares no boundary with z and is completely contained in z's interior.
   - x and y are disconnected (DC(x, y)), meaning x and y share no parts.

2. **Possible spatial scenarios for x relative to z**:
   - **x is entirely outside z**:
     - If x does not touch z, then DC(x, z).
     - If x touches z's boundary but does not overlap, then EC(x, z).
   - **x is partially inside and partially outside z**:
     - Since y is inside z, but x and y are disconnected, x can overlap parts of z that avoid y. Thus, PO(x, z) is possible (overlap without containment).
   - **x is entirely inside z**:
     - If x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x, z).
     - If x is strictly inside z (no boundary touch), then NTPP(x, z).
     - Note: x can be inside z without conflicting with DC(x, y) if x and y occupy disjoint regions within z.

3. **Impossible relations**:
   - **TPPi(x, z) or NTPPi(x, z)**: These require z to be a proper part of x. However, if z were inside x, then y (inside z) would also be inside x, contradicting DC(x, y).
   - **EQ(x, z)**: Equality would imply x contains y, violating DC(x, y).
   - **PO(x, z) is possible**: Even though y is inside z, x can overlap z in regions not occupied by y (since DC(x, y) holds).

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x, z) (disconnected)
- EC(x, z) (externally connected)
- PO(x, z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x, z) (tangential proper part)
- NTPP(x, z) (non-tangential proper part)

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
