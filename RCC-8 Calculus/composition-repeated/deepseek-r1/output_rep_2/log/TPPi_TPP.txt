PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the RCC-8 composition. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary). TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is part of z and touches z's boundary).

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, where x and z share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other. This is possible when x and z overlap only in regions including y, and both have parts outside the overlap.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality, where x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region, with y being a tangential proper part of both.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, where x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is part of z and shares a boundary point with z, influenced by y touching z's boundary.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse tangential proper part, where z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is part of x and shares a boundary point with x, influenced by y touching x's boundary.

The relations DC, EC, NTPP, and NTPPi are not possible because:
- DC and EC require no shared interior parts, but y is a shared part with interior.
- NTPP and NTPPi require no boundary touching, but y forces tangency with the boundaries of both x and z.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, EQ, TPP, and TPPi.

### Answer: PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi
