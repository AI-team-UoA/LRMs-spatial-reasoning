PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. Since PO(x,y) implies x and y share some interior points but not all, and TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z touching its boundary, x could extend outside z or overlap z in a way that neither is part of the other. For example, x might share parts with z but also have regions outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. Since y is inside z and partially overlaps x, x could be entirely within z and touch z's boundary. The overlap with y might allow x to reach z's boundary without covering all of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely contained within z's interior (not touching its boundary) and overlaps y (which is inside z), this is possible. For instance, x could be a subset of z's interior, partially overlapping y which touches z's boundary.

These possibilities arise because:
- PO(x,y) ensures x and y share interior points, but neither contains the other.
- TPP(y,z) places y inside z, touching z's boundary.
- Thus, x could interact with z in varied ways: overlapping without containment (PO), being a proper part touching the boundary (TPP), or being a proper part entirely in the interior (NTPP).

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)**: Contradicted because x and z share interior points (via y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible since y is a proper part of z (so z has points not in y), but PO(x,y) requires points in y not in x, so x ≠ z.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Would imply z is a proper part of x, but then y ⊆ z ⊆ x, contradicting PO(x,y) which requires points in y not in x.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
