PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is that they are disconnected, meaning DC(x,z). This is because:

- NTPP(x,y) indicates that x is entirely contained within y and does not touch the boundary of y.
- EC(y,z) indicates that y and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.
- Since x is not near the boundary of y and y only touches z at the boundary, x and z cannot share any points (boundary or interior). Thus, they must be disconnected.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z in this scenario.

### Answer:  
DC(x,z)
