PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary). Also given TPP(y,z), so y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary).

The possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. x and z share some spatial parts, but neither is a part of the other. This is possible because y is inside x and on the boundary of z, and z may extend outside x while x extends outside z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x). z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary). This is possible if y touches z's boundary at a point not on x's boundary, ensuring NTPP(y,x) holds.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x). z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and does not touch x's boundary). This is possible because y is inside x and on the boundary of z, and if z is entirely within x without touching its boundary, NTPP(y,x) is consistent.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share spatial parts.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because NTPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z) imply conflicting boundary conditions for y if x and z are equal.
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because if x were part of z, y being deep inside x and not touching boundaries would contradict TPP(y,z), which requires y to touch z's boundary.
- PO, TPPi, and NTPPi are the only possible relations.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
