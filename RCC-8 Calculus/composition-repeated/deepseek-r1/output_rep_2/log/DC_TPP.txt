PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely outside z and does not touch its boundary. For example, x and z are separate regions with no overlap.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x touches the boundary of z externally at a point not shared with y. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, x can touch z elsewhere without conflicting with DC(x,y).
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x partially overlaps with z, but the overlapping part does not include y. Since y is a proper part of z and disjoint from x, x can share parts with z without intersecting y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (inside z and touching its boundary), as long as x does not overlap y and avoids the boundary points occupied by y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (entirely inside z without touching the boundary), and disjoint from y.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible:
- EQ(x,z) would imply x = z, but TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, conflicting with DC(x,y) (x and y must be disjoint).
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, so y (inside z) would overlap x, violating DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
