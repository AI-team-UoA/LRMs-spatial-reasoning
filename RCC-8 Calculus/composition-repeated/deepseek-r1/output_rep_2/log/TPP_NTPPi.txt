PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y):

- TPP(x,y) implies x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(z,y) implies z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary (i.e., z is entirely in y's interior).

Both x and z are within y, but their relative positions can vary. The possible relations between x and z are:

1. **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x (touching y's boundary) and z (in y's interior) do not overlap or touch.
2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. This occurs if they share a boundary point but no interior parts.
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. They share interior points but neither is a proper part of the other.
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Since z is in y's interior and x touches y's boundary, z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained in x's interior without touching x's boundary.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is inside z, but z is entirely in y's interior, so x could not touch y's boundary, contradicting TPP(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because x touches y's boundary while z does not.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
