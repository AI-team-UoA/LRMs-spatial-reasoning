PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- NTPP(x, y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and does not touch y's boundary).
- TPPi(y, z): equivalent to TPP(z, y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary).

The possible relationships between x and z are determined by considering the spatial constraints:
- x is strictly interior to y (no boundary contact).
- z is part of y but touches y's boundary.

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x, z)**: Disconnected. x and z do not touch or overlap (e.g., x is in the deep interior of y, z is near the boundary, and they are separated).
- **EC(x, z)**: Externally connected. x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts (e.g., x touches z internally in y without overlapping).
- **PO(x, z)**: Partially overlapping. x and z share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other (e.g., x and z overlap in the interior of y).
- **TPP(x, z)**: Tangential proper part. x is a tangential proper part of z (x touches z's boundary and is part of z; note that z's boundary may be internal to y, so x does not necessarily touch y's boundary).
- **NTPP(x, z)**: Non-tangential proper part. x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary).

These relations are consistent because:
- x cannot be EQ, TPPi, or NTPPi to z, as that would imply z contains x and touches y's boundary, forcing x to touch y's boundary (contradicting NTPP(x, y)).
- The composition table for RCC-8 (NTPP âˆ˜ TPPi) confirms these five possibilities.
