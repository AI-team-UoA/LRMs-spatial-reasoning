PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be the same as between x and y because EQ(y,z) implies y and z are identical regions. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap (share some but not all parts, and neither is a part of the other). Therefore, the relation between x and z is also partial overlap, PO(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) imply x and y (hence x and z) are not identical.  
- DC, EC, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi would contradict PO(x,y) by implying disconnection, boundary-only contact, or a part-whole relationship, which PO excludes.  

Thus, the only possible relation is PO(x,z).
