PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).
- NTPPi(y, z): Equivalent to NTPP(z, y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely contained within y's interior, not touching its boundary).

Analysis:
- Since z is entirely inside y (as a non-tangential part), any part of z is also a part of y.
- DC(x, y) implies x and y share no parts (disconnected).
- Therefore, x cannot share any part with z (because z is part of y, and x shares nothing with y).
- This rules out all relations except DC(x, z):
  - EC(x, z): Impossible, as touching would imply a common boundary point, but x and y are disconnected, and z is inside y.
  - PO(x, z): Impossible, as partial overlap would imply shared parts with z (and thus with y).
  - TPP(x, z), NTPP(x, z), TPPi(x, z), NTPPi(x, z): Impossible, as any part-of relation would imply x and z share parts (contradicting DC(x, y) via z âŠ† y).
  - EQ(x, z): Impossible, as equality would imply x and z are the same, making x part of y (contradicting DC(x, y)).

Conclusion:  
The only possible relation between x and z is DC(x, z).
