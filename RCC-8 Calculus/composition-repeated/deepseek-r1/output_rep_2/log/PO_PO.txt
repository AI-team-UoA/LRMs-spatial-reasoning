PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations. This is because the composition of the partial overlap (PO) relation with itself can result in all base relations, depending on the spatial configurations of x, y, and z. Below are the possible relations and brief examples for clarity:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. For example, y is a circle; x overlaps the top-left part of y, and z overlaps the bottom-right part of y, with x and z not touching or sharing any parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. For example, y is a circle; x and z both overlap y but touch only at a boundary point without sharing interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. For example, y is a circle; x and z both overlap the same region of y, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. For example, z is a large rectangle; y partially overlaps z (e.g., 70% inside z); x partially overlaps y and is entirely within z, touching z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For example, similar to TPP, but x is entirely within z without touching its boundary.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP). For example, x is large; y partially overlaps x; z partially overlaps y and is entirely within x, touching x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP). For example, similar to TPPi, but z is entirely within x without touching its boundary.
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal). For example, x and z are the same region, both partially overlapping y.

Thus, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.
