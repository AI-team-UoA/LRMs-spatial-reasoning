PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the RCC-8 composition table for the relations EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, and NTPPi. 

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected (e.g., y is a buffer region between x and z, preventing contact).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally (e.g., x, y, z form a chain where x and z share a boundary).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (e.g., x and z overlap in a way that y connects at their boundaries without sharing interiors).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (e.g., x is inside z, touching its boundary, and y connects externally to both).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is inside x, touching its boundary, and y connects externally to both).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (e.g., x is inside z without touching its boundary, and y connects externally via a configuration involving holes or complex boundaries).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is inside x without touching its boundary, and y connects externally via a configuration involving holes or complex boundaries).

The relation EQ(x,z) (x and z coincident) is not possible under the standard RCC-8 composition for EC o EC, as it would require x=z, but EC relations imply distinct regions, and the composition does not yield EQ.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi
