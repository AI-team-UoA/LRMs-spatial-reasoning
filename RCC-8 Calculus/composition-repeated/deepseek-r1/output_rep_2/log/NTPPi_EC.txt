PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).  
- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.  
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected; they share a boundary point but no interior points.  

The contact point between y and z lies on the boundary of y. Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, this boundary point is strictly inside x (not on x's boundary). Therefore, z must intersect x at this point, meaning z cannot be disconnected from x.  

Possible relations between x and z:  
1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. z overlaps with x but is not a part of x, and x is not a part of z. This is possible because z can share the contact point with y (inside x) and extend partially outside x.  
2. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible; z can touch y (inside x) and also touch x's boundary.  
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary. This is possible; z can touch y (inside x) without reaching x's boundary.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected – excluded because z touches y inside x.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected – requires no interior overlap, but the contact point is inside x.  
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a proper part of z, as z would need to contain x (including y), conflicting with EC(y,z).  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality – excluded as y is a proper part of x but only externally connected to z.  

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
