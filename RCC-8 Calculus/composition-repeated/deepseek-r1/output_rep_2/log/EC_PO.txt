PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts. This occurs when z does not extend to the boundary point where x and y touch.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs when z includes the boundary point where x and y touch, allowing x and z to meet externally.

Other relations are impossible:
- PO(x,z) is excluded because x and z share no interior parts (since EC(x,y) implies no interior overlap with y, and PO(y,z) implies z overlaps y's interior, disjoint from x).
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are excluded because they require one region to be part of the other or equality, which contradicts the disjoint interiors of x and z.
