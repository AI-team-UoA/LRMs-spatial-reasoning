PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which mean:
- TPPi(x,y) ≡ TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z) ≡ TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

This implies that z is a proper part of x, but the exact nature of the relationship depends on the spatial configuration:
- If z touches the boundary of x (e.g., if the point where z touches y aligns with the boundary shared between y and x), then z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x) holds, meaning TPPi(x,z).
- If z does not touch the boundary of x (e.g., if z touches an internal part of y's boundary not shared with x), then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x) holds, meaning NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, for the relationship between x and z, the possible relations are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Other RCC-8 relations are not possible because:
- DC, EC, PO: Excluded since z is entirely contained within x due to the part-of chain.
- EQ: Excluded because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x.
- TPP, NTPP: These would imply that x is a part of z, which contradicts the hierarchy (z is part of y and y is part of x, so x cannot be part of z).

Thus, the possible relationships are TPPi and NTPPi.

### Answer: TPPi, NTPPi
