PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- EQ(x,y) means x and y are spatially identical.
- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is part of y, touches y's boundary, but is not equal to y).

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), the spatial properties of y apply directly to x. Therefore:
- z being a tangential proper part of y implies that z is also a tangential proper part of x.
- This corresponds to the relation TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible, as z is a proper part of y (and thus of x) and not equal.
- NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) is impossible, as the tangential condition (touching the boundary) is specified.
- PO(x,z), EC(x,z), or DC(x,z) are impossible, as z is part of x, so they must be connected and overlapping in a part-whole manner.
- Other relations like TPP(x,z) or its inverses do not hold, as z is part of x, not vice versa.

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z)
