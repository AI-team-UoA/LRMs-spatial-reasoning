PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are derived from spatial reasoning. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other. DC(y,z) indicates that y and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts. The possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if the overlapping part of x with y does not extend towards z, leaving x and z with no common points.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x extends from y and touches the boundary of z without sharing interior parts, as y and z are disconnected.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x shares some interior parts with z in a region not involving y, since y and z share no parts.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is part of x and touches the boundary of x, with y overlapping x in a different area, avoiding conflict with DC(y,z).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x without touching the boundary, and y overlaps x in a separate region.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, forcing y to share parts with z (due to PO(x,y)), contradicting DC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are identical, but PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) cannot both hold (as PO(x,y) requires shared parts with y, while DC(y,z) requires no shared parts with z if x and z are the same).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
