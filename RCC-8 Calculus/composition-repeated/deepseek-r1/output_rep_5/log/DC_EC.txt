PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.  
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.  
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.  
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.  
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.  
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  

The relations EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible because:  
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are the same, contradicting DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).  
- TPPi(x,z) (i.e., TPP(z,x)) or NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) would mean z is a proper part of x, but since EC(y,z) implies y touches z, and thus touches x, this contradicts DC(x,y).  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
