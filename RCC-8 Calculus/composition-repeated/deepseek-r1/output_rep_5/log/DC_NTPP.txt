PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus.  

- DC(x,y) indicates x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).  
- NTPP(y,z) indicates y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z, not touching its boundary).  

Considering the spatial configuration:  
- x must not overlap with y, but x could be outside z, partially overlapping z, or entirely inside z (in regions not overlapping y).  
- The relations TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because they would imply z is inside x, but y is inside z (by NTPP(y,z)), leading to y being inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).  
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because it would imply x and z are identical, but y is inside z and disconnected from x, which is inconsistent.  
- PO(x,z) is possible: x and z overlap partially, but the overlap avoids y.  
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible: x is entirely inside z (tangentially or non-tangentially) in a region disjoint from y.  
- DC(x,z) is possible: x is completely outside z.  
- EC(x,z) is possible: x touches z externally without overlapping.  

Thus, the possible relations are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
