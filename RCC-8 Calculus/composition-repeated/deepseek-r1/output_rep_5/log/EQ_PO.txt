PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (identical spatial regions), and PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other), the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

- Since EQ(x,y) implies x and y are the same region, the relation PO(y,z) directly translates to PO(x,z) because x is indistinguishable from y.
- No other RCC-8 relation is possible:
  - EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but PO(y,z) implies y and z are not identical, and since x = y, this is impossible.
  - DC(x,z) would mean disconnected, but PO(y,z) implies overlap, so they are connected.
  - EC(x,z) would mean touching but no interior sharing, but PO(y,z) implies interior sharing.
  - TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) would imply that one is a proper part of the other, but PO(y,z) states that neither is part of the other.

Thus, the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).
