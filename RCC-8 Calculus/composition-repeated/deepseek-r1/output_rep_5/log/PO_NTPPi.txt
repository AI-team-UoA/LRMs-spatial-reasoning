PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of the relations. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other. NTPPi(y,z) indicates that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if the overlap between x and y does not intersect with z, so x and z share no parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if x and z touch only at their boundaries but share no interior parts, which is possible since z is inside y and x overlaps y in a way that allows boundary contact without interior sharing.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs if x and y overlap in a region that includes part of z, so x and z share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x). It occurs if z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible because x can contain z while having parts outside y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x). It occurs if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary. This is possible if x fully contains z in its interior.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(y,x), and NTPPi(y,x) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but z is a proper part of y while x is not contained in y.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but z is a proper part of y, and x is not contained in y, leading to a contradiction.
- The inverses TPPi(y,x) and NTPPi(y,x) are not applicable here as the relations are between x and z.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
