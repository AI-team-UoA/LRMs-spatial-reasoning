PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be consistent with the spatial properties.

- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since y and z are identical, the spatial relation between x and z is the same as between x and y. Therefore, x and z must be externally connected, meaning EC(x,z) holds.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) would imply disconnection, contradicting EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap, but EC(x,y) requires no shared interior.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) would imply a part-whole relationship, which is not present in EC.
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are identical, but EC(x,y) implies x and y are distinct and only touch at a boundary.

Thus, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
