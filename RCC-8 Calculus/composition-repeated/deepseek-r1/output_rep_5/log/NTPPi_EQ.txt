PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), this means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, so y is strictly inside x and does not touch x's boundary. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. The only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which indicates that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible since z is a proper part of x (not equal).
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, or TPPi do not hold, as z is strictly inside x without touching the boundary, and the relation is specifically non-tangential.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
