PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary). Since x is disconnected from y (they share no spatial points), and z is a part of y, x must also be disconnected from z. Any other relation (e.g., EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ) would imply some spatial connection between x and z, which would contradict DC(x,y) because z is part of y. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
