PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), which translate to TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z). This means y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, sharing boundary points with each. The possible relations between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and topological considerations for regular closed sets:

- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region, and y is a tangential proper part of both.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs when x and z share interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other, and y is placed at a boundary point common to both.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z and shares a boundary point with z, with y positioned at that boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This can occur in non-convex or disconnected regions where x is entirely within the interior of z, and y touches the boundary of z from within x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)). This is possible if z is inside x and shares a boundary point with x, with y at that boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)). This can occur in non-convex or disconnected regions where z is entirely within the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of x from within z.

The relations DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are impossible because y is a common part of both x and z, ensuring they share at least some interior points. Thus, the possible relations are EQ, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: EQ, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi
