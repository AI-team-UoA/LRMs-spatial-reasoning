PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z). NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch its boundary. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but each has parts not shared by the other.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the spatial configurations:

1. **x is entirely within the overlap of y and z**:
   - If x is entirely within the interior of z, then NTPP(x,z) holds.
   - If x is within z but touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) holds.

2. **x is not entirely within the overlap of y and z**:
   - If x and z have no common points, then DC(x,z) holds.
   - If x and z touch at a boundary point but share no interior points, then EC(x,z) holds.
   - If x and z share interior points but neither is part of the other, then PO(x,z) holds.

All five relations are possible, as verified by examples:
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a small region deep inside the overlap, entirely in the interior of z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is contained in z but touches z's boundary.
- **DC(x,z)**: x is in y but entirely outside z, with no contact.
- **EC(x,z)**: x touches z's boundary at a point but shares no interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps with z, sharing interior points but not fully contained.

The inverse relations (TPPi, NTPPi) and EQ are impossible because x is a proper part of y, and z is not contained in y, so z cannot be part of or equal to x.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
