PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible because x and y share some parts, and y is inside z. However, x may extend beyond z or not cover all of z, leading to shared parts and distinct parts between x and z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This can occur if the overlapping region between x and y is near the boundary of z, or if x extends to the boundary while remaining inside.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part is possible if x is entirely contained within z without touching its boundary. This can happen if x overlaps y in the interior of z and does not extend to the boundary.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because x and y share parts, and y is part of z, so x and z must share parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible because x and z share interior parts (from the overlap of x and y inside z).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal is impossible because y is a proper part of z (so z has parts not in y), and x only partially overlaps y (so x has parts not in y), implying x and z cannot be identical.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverses (z part of x) are impossible because y is a proper part of z, and z has parts not in y, which may not be covered by x (since PO(x,y) does not require x to extend beyond y).

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP.
