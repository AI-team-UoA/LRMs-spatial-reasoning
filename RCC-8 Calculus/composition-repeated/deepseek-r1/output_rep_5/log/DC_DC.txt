PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), meaning that y is disconnected from both x and z, there are no restrictions on the possible relationship between x and z. All eight RCC-8 relations are possible:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary).
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal).

This is because the disconnection of y from both x and z does not impose any constraints on the spatial relationship between x and z; they can be in any configuration relative to each other while y remains separate.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
