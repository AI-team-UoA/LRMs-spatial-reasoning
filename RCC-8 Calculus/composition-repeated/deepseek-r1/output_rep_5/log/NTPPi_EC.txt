PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is completely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x.

Given EC(y,z), which means y and z are externally connected. They share a boundary point but no interior points.

The possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. x and z share some interior points but neither is a part of the other. This occurs when z overlaps with x and touches y at a boundary point, which is interior to x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Tangential proper part inverse, equivalent to TPP(z,x). This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x. Since z touches y (which is inside x), this is possible if z is near the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part inverse, equivalent to NTPP(z,x). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x. Since z touches y (which is also inside x), this is possible if both are fully interior to x.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are impossible because the point where y and z touch is interior to x, forcing x and z to share interior points.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they imply x is part of z or equal to z, which would mean y is part of z, contradicting EC(y,z) (which requires no shared interior points).

Thus, the possible relationships are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
