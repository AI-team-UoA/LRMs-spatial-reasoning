PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), meaning x and y are coincident and y and z are coincident, the relation between x and z must be coincident due to transitivity. Therefore, the only possible relationship is EQ(x,z).

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
