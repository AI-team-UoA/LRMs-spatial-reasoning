PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. Given TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is part of z, touches z's boundary, and is not equal to z.  

Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between x and z is identical to that between y and z. Therefore, x must also be a tangential proper part of z.  

Possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, satisfying the conditions.  

No other relations are possible:  
- DC, EC, PO: Require x and z to not be part-related, but x is part of z.  
- NTPP: Requires no boundary touching, but TPP implies boundary contact.  
- TPPi, NTPPi: Would imply z is part of x, but z contains x.  
- EQ: Requires x and z to be equal, but z properly contains x.  

Thus, the only possible relation is TPP(x,z).
