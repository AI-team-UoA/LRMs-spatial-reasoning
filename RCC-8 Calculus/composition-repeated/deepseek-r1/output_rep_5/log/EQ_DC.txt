PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are identical regions. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected and share no parts. Since x is identical to y, x must also be disconnected from z and share no parts. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
