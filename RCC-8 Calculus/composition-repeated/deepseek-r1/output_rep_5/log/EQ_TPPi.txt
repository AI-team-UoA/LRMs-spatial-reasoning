PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are spatially identical. Given TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), z is a tangential proper part of y. Since x and y are identical, z is also a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is the inverse of TPP(z,x), which is TPPi(x,z). This is the only possible relation, as no other RCC-8 relations are consistent with the given conditions.
