PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and logical reasoning. PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial region but neither being a proper part of the other. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y, implying z is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected, if z is entirely within the part of y not overlapped by x, so x and z share no common points.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected, if z is in the non-overlapped part of y but touches the boundary where x and y meet, so x and z share a boundary point but no interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping, if z is partially within the overlapped region of x and y, so x and z share some interior but neither is a proper part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Tangential proper part inverse, meaning z is a tangential proper part of x, if z is entirely within the overlapped region and touches x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part inverse, meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x, if z is entirely within the overlapped region but does not touch x's boundary.

Relations such as EQ, TPP, NTPP, or POi (which is the same as PO) are not possible because:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible since x and z cannot be coincident (as z is a proper part of y and x is not part of y).
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but z is a proper part of y, and x is not part of y, so x cannot be part of z.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
