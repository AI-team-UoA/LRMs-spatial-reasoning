PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x (touching y's boundary) and z (entirely within y's interior) do not share any points.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This occurs if they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts, which is feasible since x is near y's boundary and z is in the interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This happens if they share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other, which is possible as both are within y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Since z is entirely within y's interior and x is a tangential part of y, z could be contained within x without touching its boundary, satisfying the conditions.

Other relations are impossible:
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **EQ(x,z)**: These would require x to be part of z or vice versa, but x touches y's boundary while z does not, leading to contradictions (e.g., if z contains x, z would inherit the boundary touch, violating NTPP(z,y); if x contains z, it must do so non-tangentially for NTPP(z,x)).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, NTPPi
