PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y touches the boundary of x and is inside x). Also given NTPP(y,z), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z and does not touch z's boundary).  

The possible relations between x and z are:  
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs when x and z share some interior parts (including y), but neither is entirely contained in the other. For example, x may extend beyond z in some regions while overlapping in others, as long as the boundary point of x touched by y lies within z's interior (to avoid y touching z's boundary).  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. Since y touches x's boundary but is entirely within z, x must be inside z without reaching its boundary to prevent y from touching z's boundary.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **DC(x,z)**, **EC(x,z)**: Excluded because x and z share y, so they must overlap.  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Excluded because y is a tangential proper part of x but a non-tangential proper part of z, which would be contradictory if x and z were equal.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part is excluded because if x touched z's boundary, then y (touching x's boundary) would indirectly touch z's boundary, violating NTPP(y,z).  
- **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: Excluded because z cannot be a proper part of x without conflicting with the given relations (e.g., if z were inside x, y would be forced to touch z's boundary).  

Thus, the possible relations are PO(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: PO(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
