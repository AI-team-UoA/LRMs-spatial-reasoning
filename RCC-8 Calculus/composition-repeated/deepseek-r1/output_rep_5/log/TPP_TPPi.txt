PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), we have:
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y: x is part of y, touches y's boundary, and x ≠ y.
- TPP(z,y) implies z is a tangential proper part of y: z is part of y, touches y's boundary, and z ≠ y.

The possible relations between x and z are determined by their spatial arrangement within y. Both x and z must touch y's boundary, and they may or may not overlap, be disjoint, or have part-whole relationships. However, non-tangential relations (NTPP and NTPPi) are impossible because they would imply one region does not touch y's boundary, contradicting the given tangential conditions.

The possible relations are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disjoint (no shared parts).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally but share no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (share some interior parts but neither is part of the other).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (same region).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary).

These six relations are consistent with the constraints. For example:
- **EQ**: If x and z are identical, both satisfy the given relations.
- **DC/EC/PO**: x and z can be arranged within y without violating tangency (e.g., separate or touching regions both tangential to y).
- **TPP/TPPi**: If x is a tangential part of z (or vice versa), the tangency to y is preserved through the shared boundary point.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi
