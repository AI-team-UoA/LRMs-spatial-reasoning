PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations, as there exist spatial configurations that satisfy each case. The possible relations are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.  
  Example: y is a region between x and z; x and y touch externally, y and z touch externally, but x and z do not share any boundary or interior points.  
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected.  
  Example: x, y, z form a chain where each pair touches externally; x and z share a boundary point directly.  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.  
  Example: x and z both touch y externally but also share some interior points with each other.  
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal).  
  Example: x and z are the same region; both touch y externally.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.  
  Example: x is a proper part of z, touching z's boundary; y touches x externally and also touches z externally at a different point.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  
  Example: x is strictly inside z, not touching its boundary; y touches x externally and also touches z externally at a separate point.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).  
  Example: z is a proper part of x, touching x's boundary; y touches z externally and also touches x externally at a different point.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).  
  Example: z is strictly inside x, not touching its boundary; y touches z externally and also touches x externally at a separate point.  

Thus, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.
