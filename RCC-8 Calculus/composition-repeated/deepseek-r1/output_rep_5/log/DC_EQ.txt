PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts, and EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (i.e., identical in spatial terms), the spatial relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, x and z are disconnected, so the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because EQ(y,z) implies that z is identical to y, so any relation involving x and y directly applies to x and z. For example:
- EC(x,z) is impossible because x and z cannot touch if they are disconnected.
- PO(x,z) is impossible as there can be no partial overlap.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi are all impossible since DC implies no part-whole relationship.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because x and y are disconnected, so x and z cannot be coincident.

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
