PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), since EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical regions, the spatial relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z)
