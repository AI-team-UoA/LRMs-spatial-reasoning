PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. The composition EC ; DC results in the following possible relations for x and z:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This occurs if z is positioned such that it is far from both x and y, or not in contact with x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs if z is in contact with x but not with y, for example, when z is adjacent to x on a side opposite to where y is connected.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other. This occurs if z overlaps with x but not with y, for instance, when z is positioned to cover part of x away from y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary). This occurs if z is a sub-region of x touching x's boundary, and y is externally connected to x but disconnected from z.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary). This occurs if z is a sub-region of x not touching the boundary, and y is externally connected to x but disconnected from z.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because:
- If x were a proper part of z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)), then since y is externally connected to x, y would necessarily be connected to z (at least EC(y,z)), contradicting DC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are the same region, but this is inconsistent with the given relations involving y.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
