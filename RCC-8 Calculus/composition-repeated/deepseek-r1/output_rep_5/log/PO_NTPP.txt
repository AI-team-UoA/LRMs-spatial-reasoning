PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined as follows:

- **PO(x,y)**: x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **NTPP(y,z)**: y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Considering the spatial interactions:
1. Since y is entirely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), the part of x that overlaps with y (from PO(x,y)) must also be inside z. Thus, x and z share at least some interior parts.
2. However, the part of x not overlapping y (which exists due to PO(x,y)) may or may not be entirely contained within z:
   - If the entire x is contained within z, then x is a proper part of z. This leads to:
     - **TPP(x,z)**: if x touches z's boundary.
     - **NTPP(x,z)**: if x is entirely in z's interior (not touching the boundary).
   - If x extends outside z, then x and z partially overlap, leading to **PO(x,z)**.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Contradicts PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), as it would imply y is a proper part of x, violating PO(x,y).
- **DC(x,z)** or **EC(x,z)**: Impossible because x and z share interior parts (from the overlap of x and y within z).
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Require z to be a proper part of x, but z contains y, and PO(x,y) prevents y from being part of x.

Thus, the possible relations are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and PO(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), PO(x,z)
