PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, meaning x and z share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary).

These are the only possible relations, as other RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, EQ, TPP, NTPP) are inconsistent with the given conditions.

### Answer:  
PO, TPPi, NTPPi
