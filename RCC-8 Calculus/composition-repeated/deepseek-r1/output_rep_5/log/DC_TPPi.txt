PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected with no common parts.
- TPPi(y, z): equivalent to TPP(z, y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary).

Analysis:
- Since z is a part of y (from TPP(z, y)), any part of z is also a part of y.
- DC(x, y) implies x shares no parts with y.
- Therefore, x cannot share any parts with z (as z is part of y), ruling out relations like PO, EC, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.
- The only remaining relation is DC(x, z), indicating x and z are disconnected with no common parts.

Verification:
- Consider spatial consistency: If x is disconnected from y and z is entirely within y (touching y's boundary), then x must be disconnected from z.
- The RCC-8 composition table confirms that the composition of DC and TPPi results in DC.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x, z).
