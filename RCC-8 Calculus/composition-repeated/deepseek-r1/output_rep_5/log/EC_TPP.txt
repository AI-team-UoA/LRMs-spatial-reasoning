PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. The composition of EC and TPP results in the following possible relations for x and z: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs when x is entirely outside z but touches it at the point where y is connected to z's boundary.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some spatial parts but neither is a part of the other. This occurs when x overlaps with z, extending both inside and outside z, while touching y at the boundary.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This occurs when x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z at the same point as y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This occurs when x is entirely within z and touches y at a point that is not on z's boundary, so x itself does not touch z's boundary.

The relations DC, EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)** is impossible because x touches y, and y is part of z, so x cannot be disconnected from z.
- **EQ(x,z)** is impossible because y is a proper part of z (due to TPP(y,z)), and x touches y externally, so x cannot be coincident with z.
- **TPPi(x,z)** and **NTPPi(x,z)** are impossible because they imply z is part of x, but TPP(y,z) means y is part of z, leading to a contradiction with EC(x,y) (which requires no shared interior between x and y).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
