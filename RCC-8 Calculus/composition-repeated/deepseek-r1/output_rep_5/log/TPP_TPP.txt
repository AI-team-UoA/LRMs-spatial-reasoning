PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

- TPP(x,z) occurs if x shares a boundary point with z, which can happen when x is positioned at the point where y and z touch.
- NTPP(x,z) occurs if x does not share any boundary point with z, which can happen when x is not near the boundary point of contact between y and z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as x must be a proper part of z due to transitivity, but it may or may not be tangential depending on the positioning.

### Answer: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
