PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- NTPP(x,y) implies that x is entirely contained within y, with no part of x touching the boundary of y.
- DC(y,z) implies that y and z share no common points (disconnected).

Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, every point of x is a point of y. Because y and z are disconnected (DC), they have no common points. Therefore, x and z cannot share any points, as any point in x would also be in y, but y and z are disjoint.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC (disconnected). Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would require some form of spatial overlap or contact, which contradicts DC(y,z) and the containment of x in y.
