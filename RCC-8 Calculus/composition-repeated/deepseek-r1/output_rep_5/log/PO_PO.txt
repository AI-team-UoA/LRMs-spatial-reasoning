PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z can be any of the eight RCC-8 relations, as the composition of PO with PO allows for all possibilities. This is because the spatial configurations can vary such that x and z may be disconnected, externally connected, partially overlapping, related by tangential or non-tangential proper parthood in either direction, or equal.

The possible relations are:
- DC(x,z): Disconnected
- EC(x,z): Externally connected
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP)
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP)
- EQ(x,z): Equal

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
