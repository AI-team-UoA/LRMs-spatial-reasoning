{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x, y), x and y are coincident (identical regions). Given EC(y, z), y and z are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts). Since x is identical to y, the relationship between x and z must be the same as that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation is EC(x, z).\n\n### Answer: EC", "elapsed-time": 29.028879404067993, "reasoning-tokens": 378, "completion-tokens": 461}
