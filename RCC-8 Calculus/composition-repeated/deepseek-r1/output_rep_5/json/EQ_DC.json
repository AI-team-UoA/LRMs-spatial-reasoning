{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y), x and y are identical regions. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected and share no parts. Since x is identical to y, x must also be disconnected from z and share no parts. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: DC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 20.016545057296753, "reasoning-tokens": 268, "completion-tokens": 338}
