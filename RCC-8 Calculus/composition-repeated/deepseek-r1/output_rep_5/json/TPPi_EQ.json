{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z):  \n- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x.  \n- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).  \n\nSince z is identical to y, the relationship between x and z is the same as between x and y. Thus, TPPi(x,z) holds, meaning TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.  \n\nNo other RCC-8 relations are possible because EQ(y,z) implies z inherits y's spatial relations exactly.  \n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 42.14801049232483, "reasoning-tokens": 667, "completion-tokens": 805}
