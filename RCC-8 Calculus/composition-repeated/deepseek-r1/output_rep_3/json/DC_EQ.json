{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z):  \n- EQ(y,z) means y and z are spatially coincident (identical).  \n- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).  \nSince y and z are identical, x must be disconnected from z in the same way. Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).  \n\n### Answer: DC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 18.132598638534546, "reasoning-tokens": 199, "completion-tokens": 287}
