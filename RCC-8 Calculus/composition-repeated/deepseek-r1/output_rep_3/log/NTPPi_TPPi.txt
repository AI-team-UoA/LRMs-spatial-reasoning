PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch its boundary.

Given TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This implies that z is part of y and touches the boundary of y.

Since z is part of y and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely contained within the interior of x. Because y does not touch the boundary of x, and z touches only the boundary of y (which is internal to x), z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x), which corresponds to the relation NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as z must be a proper part of x (ruling out DC, EC, PO, EQ), and it cannot touch the boundary of x (ruling out TPP and TPPi for (x,z)). NTPPi is the only possible relation.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
