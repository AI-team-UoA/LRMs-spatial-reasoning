PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), which means x and y are coincident (spatially identical), and DC(y,z), which means y and z are disconnected (share no spatial parts), the relationship between x and z must be disconnected because x is equivalent to y. Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
