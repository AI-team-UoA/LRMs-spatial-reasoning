PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a proper part of the other. DC(y,z) indicates that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

The composition of PO and DC allows for the following relations between x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, sharing no parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but sharing no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a proper part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x)).

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are not possible because they would imply that x is a part of or equal to z, which conflicts with DC(y,z) since x shares parts with y.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
