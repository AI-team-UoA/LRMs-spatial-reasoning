PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. This means:
- x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

The possible spatial relations between x and z can be any of the eight RCC-8 relations, as there are no additional constraints forcing a specific relationship. The reasoning is as follows:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z could be disjoint and share no common parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z could touch externally at a boundary without overlapping interiors.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z could partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither containing the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x could be a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z could be a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z without touching z's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x without touching x's boundary).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z could be the same region (coincident).

All eight relations are possible because the given conditions (both x and z inside y non-tangentially) do not restrict the relative configuration of x and z within y.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPP(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
