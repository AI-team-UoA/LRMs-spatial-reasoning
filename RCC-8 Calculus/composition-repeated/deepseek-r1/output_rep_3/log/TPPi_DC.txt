PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition rules. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, sharing no parts. This occurs if z is completely outside x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but sharing no interior parts. This is possible if z touches x's boundary at a point not occupied by y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither is part of the other. This can happen if z overlaps with x in a region away from y, ensuring no overlap with y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. z is part of x and touches x's boundary, but is disconnected from y within x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary, and is disconnected from y within x.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(z,x) (which would imply TPP(x,z)), NTPPi(z,x) (implying NTPP(x,z)), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would imply that x is part of z or equal to z, leading to a contradiction with DC(y,z) since y is part of x.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
