PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary), and PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap (they share interior points but neither is part of the other), the possible relations between x and z are as follows:

- **PO(x,z)**: This occurs if z is not entirely contained within x. Since z overlaps y (which is inside x), part of z is inside x and part is outside, resulting in partial overlap between x and z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Since z overlaps y and y touches x's boundary, z may also touch the boundary in some configurations.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely contained within x but does not touch x's boundary. Since z overlaps y, which is inside x, z can be contained without boundary contact.

The relations DC, EC, EQ, TPP, and NTPP are impossible because:
- DC and EC are excluded due to interior point sharing (from PO(y,z) and y being part of x).
- EQ is impossible because y is a proper part of x, and z overlaps but is not equal to y, so x and z cannot be equal.
- TPP and NTPP would imply x is part of z, but this contradicts PO(y,z) where y cannot be part of z.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
PO, TPPi, NTPPi
