PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. Since x and y are identical, z is also a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z). This is the only possible relation.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
