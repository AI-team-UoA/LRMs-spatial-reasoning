PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- NTPP(x,y) indicates that x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary. Thus, every point of x is also a point of y.
- DC(y,z) indicates that y and z are disjoint and share no points. Thus, no point of y is shared with z.

Since x is a subset of y (due to NTPP), and y has no points in common with z (due to DC), it follows that x and z share no points. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC (disconnected).

Other relations are impossible:
- EC(x,z) would require touching at a boundary, but x is inside y and y is disjoint from z.
- PO(x,z) would require partial overlap, but x is entirely within y and y is disjoint from z.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would require x to be inside z, but x is inside y and y is disjoint from z, leading to contradiction.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would require z to be inside x, but x is inside y, implying z inside y, contradicting DC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to coincide, but x is inside y and y is disjoint from z.

Thus, DC(x,z) is the only possible relation.
