PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), the relationship between x and z must be analyzed.

- DC(x,y) implies that x and y are disconnected and share no parts.
- NTPP(z,y) implies that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is entirely contained within y's interior and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is entirely inside y (due to NTPP), and x is disconnected from y (due to DC), x cannot share any part with z. If x and z shared any part, that part would also be part of y (because z is part of y), contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, x and z must also be disconnected.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EC(x,z)**: Requires x and z to touch at a boundary, but z is separated from y's boundary (by NTPP), and x is disconnected from y, so no contact is possible.
- **PO(x,z)**: Requires partial overlap, which would imply x and y share a part (via z), contradicting DC(x,y).
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**, or **EQ(x,z)**: Would imply x is part of z, z is part of x, or x equals z, all of which would force x to overlap with y (since z is part of y), again contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
