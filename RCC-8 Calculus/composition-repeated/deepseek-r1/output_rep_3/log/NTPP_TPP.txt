PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPP(x, y) and TPP(y, z), we analyze the possible relationship between x and z.  
- NTPP(x, y) means x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.  
- TPP(y, z) means y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.  

Since x is strictly inside y (non-tangential) and y is inside z (touching z's boundary), x must be entirely inside z. However, x does not touch y's boundary, and y's boundary is the only point of contact with z's boundary. Thus, x cannot touch z's boundary. Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x, z), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  

### Answer: NTPP(x, z)
