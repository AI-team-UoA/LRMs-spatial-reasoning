PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.

Since x is strictly inside y (not touching its boundary) and y only contacts z at its boundary (with no interior overlap), x cannot be in contact with z. Specifically:
- x and z share no common points (interior or boundary) because x is in the interior of y, away from the boundary where y and z touch, and y and z have no shared interior.
- Thus, x and z are completely separate.

Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z) (disconnected).
