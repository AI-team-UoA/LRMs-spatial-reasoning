PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z):  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are spatially coincident (identical).  
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).  
Since y and z are identical, x must be disconnected from z in the same way. Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
