PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be consistent with the fact that y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical spatially). Since EC(x,y) indicates that x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts, and z is identical to y, the relation between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).

Other relations are not possible:
- DC(x,z) would imply x and z are disconnected, but EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) mean they touch.
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap, but EC(x,y) rules out any overlap.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) would imply a part-whole relationship, but EC(x,y) indicates no such relationship.
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are coincident, but this would contradict EC(x,y) since EC requires x and y to be distinct regions that touch externally.

Thus, EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
