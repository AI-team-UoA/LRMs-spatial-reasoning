PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (i.e., they have identical spatial extents), and EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, it follows that x and z must also be coincident due to the transitive property of the EQ relation in the RCC-8 calculus. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) (disconnected) is false since x and z share all parts.
- EC(x,z) (externally connected) is false because they share interior parts.
- PO(x,z) (partial overlap) is false as they are identical, not partially overlapping.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) are false because x is not a proper part of z or vice versa; they are equal.

Thus, EQ(x,z) is the only possible relation.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
