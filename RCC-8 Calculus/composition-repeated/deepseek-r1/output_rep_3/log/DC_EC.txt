PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. Specifically:

- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected with no shared parts.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.

The possible relations for R(x,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z but does not touch z's boundary).

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- If z were a part of x (TPPi or NTPPi), then since y touches z (EC(y,z)), y would share a point with x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are equal, but DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) cannot hold simultaneously with EQ(x,z).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
