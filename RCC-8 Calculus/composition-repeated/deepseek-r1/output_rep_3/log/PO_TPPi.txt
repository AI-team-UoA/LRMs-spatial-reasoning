PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being part of the other. TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if z is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with x and does not touch the boundary of the overlapping region.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if z is entirely within the non-overlapping part of y but touches the boundary of the overlapping region (which is part of x), sharing only a boundary point with x.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs if z overlaps both the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y relative to x, meaning z shares some interior with x but also has parts outside x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Tangential proper part inverse. Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This occurs if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part inverse. Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a proper part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This occurs if z is entirely within the overlapping region and is strictly interior to x.

These relations are derived from the possible spatial arrangements of z relative to the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of x and y. Note that EQ, TPP, NTPP, and other relations are impossible due to the constraints of PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y).
