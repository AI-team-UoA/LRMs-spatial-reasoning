PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z). 

- **DC(x,z)**: This is possible if x overlaps y in a region away from the boundary with z, resulting in no connection between x and z.  
- **EC(x,z)**: This is possible if x overlaps y near the boundary where y and z touch, allowing x and z to share a boundary point but no interior points.  
- **PO(x,z)**: This is possible if x extends from y into the region of z, causing x and z to share interior points without one being part of the other.  

Relations such as TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ are impossible because:  
- x cannot be a proper part of z (or vice versa) due to PO(x,y) implying part of x is in y but not in z.  
- EQ is impossible as x and y are not coincident, and y and z are not coincident.

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z)
