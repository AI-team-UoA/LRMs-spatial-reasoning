PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y, not touching y's boundary, and x ≠ y).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the spatial relationship between x and y directly applies to x and z. Therefore:
- x must be entirely inside z (since it is inside y and y = z).
- x does not touch z's boundary (since it doesn't touch y's boundary).
- x cannot be equal to z (because if x = z, then x = y, but NTPP(x,y) implies x ≠ y).

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
