PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).  

### Reasoning:  
- TPP(x,y) indicates that x is a tangential proper part of y: x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.  
- DC(y,z) indicates that y and z are disconnected: they share no spatial parts.  
- Since x is a part of y (so every part of x is also a part of y), and y shares no parts with z, it follows that x and z share no parts.  
- Therefore, x and z must be disconnected (DC).  
- No other RCC-8 relation is possible:  
  - EC is impossible because x and z cannot touch (as y and z have no contact).  
  - PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would imply some spatial overlap, contradicting DC(y,z).  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z)
