PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In this case, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.
- **PO(x,z)**: This means x and z partially overlap; they share some common interior parts, but neither is a part of the other.

These are the only possible relations, as derived from the RCC-8 composition rules and spatial reasoning. No other RCC-8 relations (such as EQ, DC, EC, TPP, NTPP, TPPi) are possible due to contradictions with the given relations.

### Answer: NTPPi, PO
