PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z):  
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x.  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).  

Since y and z are identical, the relation between x and z directly follows from the relation between x and y:  
- TPPi(x,y) implies TPP(y,x), and substituting z for y (due to EQ(y,z)) gives TPP(z,x).  
- TPP(z,x) is equivalent to TPPi(x,z) by definition.  

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
