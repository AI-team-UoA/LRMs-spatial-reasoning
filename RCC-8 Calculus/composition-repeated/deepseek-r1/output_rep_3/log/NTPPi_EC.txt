PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is a part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches the boundary of x).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x but does not touch the boundary of x).

These are the only possible relations because:
- DC(x,z) is impossible, as y is inside x and touching z, so x and z cannot be disconnected.
- EC(x,z) is impossible, as the contact point between y and z is interior to x (since y does not touch x's boundary), but EC(x,z) would require contact on x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible, as it would imply y and z share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z).
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible, as they would imply x is part of z, leading to y being part of z and sharing interior points with z, contradicting EC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
