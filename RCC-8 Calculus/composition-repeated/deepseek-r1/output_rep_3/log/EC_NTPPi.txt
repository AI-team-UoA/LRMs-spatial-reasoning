PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected, sharing a boundary but no interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely within y's interior and does not touch y's boundary).

Reasoning:
- Since z is strictly inside y's interior (not touching y's boundary), and x only contacts y at y's boundary without overlapping y's interior, x and z cannot share any spatial parts.
- Specifically, x and z have no boundary or interior contact because:
  - z's entire boundary is inside y's interior, away from y's boundary.
  - x only interacts with y at y's boundary and does not penetrate y's interior.
- Therefore, x and z are completely disconnected.

The only possible relation is DC(x,z).
