PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).  

- **EC(x,z)**: This is possible if the point where x and y touch is on the boundary of z, and x is outside z except for this boundary contact.  
- **PO(x,z)**: This is possible if x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is part of the other.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: This is possible if x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely within z and touches its boundary.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: This is possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely within z but does not touch its boundary; this requires that the point where x and y touch is not on the boundary of z.  

Relations such as DC(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible due to the constraints:  
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and y share a boundary point, and since y is part of z, x and z must be connected.  
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because y is part of z but only externally connected to x, so x and z cannot be coincident.  
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because they imply z is part of x, but EC(x,y) prevents y from being part of x (no interior sharing), and y is part of z, leading to a contradiction.  

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
