PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs when z is outside x and touches x at the point where y is located.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other. This occurs when z overlaps with x in addition to touching y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs when z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and is externally connected to y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs when z is inside x, does not touch the boundary of x, and is externally connected to y.

These relations are derived from the RCC-8 composition rules and spatial reasoning:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because y connects x and z.
- EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(y,x) (which would imply z contains x), and NTPPi(y,x) are impossible due to the constraints from EC(y,z) and TPPi(x,y) (which implies y is part of x).
