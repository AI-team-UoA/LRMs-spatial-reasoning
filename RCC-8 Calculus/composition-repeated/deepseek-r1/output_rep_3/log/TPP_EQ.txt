PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be TPP(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical spatial regions. Therefore, the relation TPP(x,y) directly translates to TPP(x,z), as x is a tangential proper part of y (and thus of z), meaning x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as the relations are pairwise disjoint and mutually exclusive.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
