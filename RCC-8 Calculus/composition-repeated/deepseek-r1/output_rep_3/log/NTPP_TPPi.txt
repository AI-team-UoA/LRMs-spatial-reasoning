PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x, y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary).
- TPPi(y, z): equivalent to TPP(z, y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary).

We determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. **DC(x, z)**: Possible if x and z are disjoint regions within y. For example, x is in the interior of y away from z, and z touches y's boundary without overlapping x.
2. **EC(x, z)**: Possible if x and z touch at a boundary (without overlapping interiors). Since x does not touch y's boundary, the contact must occur at an internal boundary of z within y.
3. **PO(x, z)**: Possible if x and z partially overlap (share some interior parts but neither is part of the other). This can occur within y's interior.
4. **TPP(x, z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). The boundary contact must be at an internal part of z (away from y's boundary), which is consistent as x avoids y's boundary.
5. **NTPP(x, z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary). This is consistent as x remains away from y's boundary.

Excluded relations:
- **EQ(x, z)**: Impossible because x does not touch y's boundary, while z does, so they cannot be coincident.
- **TPPi(x, z) (i.e., TPP(z, x))**: Impossible because if z were inside x, z would not touch y's boundary (since x avoids it), contradicting TPP(z, y).
- **NTPPi(x, z) (i.e., NTPP(z, x))**: Impossible for the same reason as TPPi; z must touch y's boundary, but x avoids it, so z cannot be inside x.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
