PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are EC(x,y) and PO(y,z). Using the RCC-8 composition table, the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- **EC(x,y)**: x and y are externally connected, sharing only a boundary point with no interior overlap.
- **PO(y,z)**: y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being a proper part of the other.

The composition of EC and PO yields all RCC-8 relations except EQ(x,z), as equality is impossible due to the constraints of EC and PO. Specifically:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected (e.g., if the overlap between y and z avoids the boundary shared by x and y).
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected (e.g., if z covers the boundary point between x and y but no further).
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap (e.g., if z extends from y into the interior of x).
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part of (e.g., if z contains x and x touches z's boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part of (e.g., if z contains x without boundary contact).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of TPP (e.g., if z is a tangential proper part of x, and z overlaps y at the boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of NTPP (e.g., if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and z overlaps y internally).

EQ(x,z) is excluded because x and z cannot be coincident given the disjoint interiors of x and y (from EC(x,y)) and the partial overlap of y and z (from PO(y,z)).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi
