PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which implies TPP(z,y), both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This means:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are as follows:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not touching or overlapping (e.g., two distinct tangential parts touching different boundary points of y).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally but share no interior parts. This is possible if x and z share a boundary point but do not overlap (e.g., both touching the same boundary point of y but with no interior overlap).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other (e.g., overlapping regions both touching y's boundary).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z contains x, and x touches z's boundary (e.g., x is a subpart of z that includes the point where z touches y's boundary, ensuring x also touches y's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x contains z, and z touches x's boundary (e.g., z is a subpart of x that includes the point where x touches y's boundary).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are equal. This is possible if x and z refer to the same region (e.g., both are identical tangential proper parts of y).

The relations NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible because:
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary). However, TPP(x,y) requires x to touch y's boundary, which cannot occur if x is interior to z and z is a proper part of y.
- Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) (which is NTPP(z,x)) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, but TPP(z,y) requires z to touch y's boundary, which cannot occur if z is interior to x.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ
