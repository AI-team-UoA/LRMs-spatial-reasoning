PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected with no shared parts, and PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither being a part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but share no interior parts).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary).

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because:
- If z were a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi), then PO(y,z) would imply that y and z overlap, meaning y and x must share parts (contradicting DC(x,y)).
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are the same, but DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) cannot hold simultaneously with EQ(x,z) as it would lead to contradictions (e.g., DC(z,y) but PO(y,z)).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
