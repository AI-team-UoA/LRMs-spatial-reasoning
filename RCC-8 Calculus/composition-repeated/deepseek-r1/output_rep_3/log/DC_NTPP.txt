PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. Since y is entirely inside z (non-tangentially) and x is disconnected from y, x could be entirely outside z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x touches z's boundary externally. This is possible as y is inside z without touching the boundary, so x could touch z's boundary without conflicting with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps z. x could overlap with a part of z that does not contain y (since x and y are disconnected), and extend outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z (touching z's boundary) and disjoint from y, which is also inside z but non-tangential.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z (not touching the boundary) and disjoint from y.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would imply x and z are the same, but then x would contain y (since y is inside z), contradicting DC(x,y).
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Would imply z is inside x, but then y (inside z) would be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
