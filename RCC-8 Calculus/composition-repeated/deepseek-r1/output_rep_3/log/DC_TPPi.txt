PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y, z): This is equivalent to TPP(z, y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:
- Since DC(x, y) holds, x and y share no common parts (neither interior nor boundary).
- TPPi(y, z) implies z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. Therefore, all parts of z are also parts of y.
- If x and z shared any common part (interior or boundary), that part would also be a part of y (because z âŠ† y). This would contradict DC(x, y), which requires no shared parts between x and y.
- Hence, x and z must share no common parts, meaning the only possible relation is DC(x, z).

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- EC(x, z): Requires sharing a boundary point, which would imply a common part with y, contradicting DC(x, y).
- PO(x, z): Requires sharing an interior part, which would imply a common part with y, contradicting DC(x, y).
- TPP(x, z), NTPP(x, z), TPPi(x, z), NTPPi(x, z): Require that one is a proper part of the other, implying spatial overlap, which contradicts DC(x, y).
- EQ(x, z): Requires x and z to be coincident, implying x shares parts with z (and thus y), contradicting DC(x, y).

Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x, z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
