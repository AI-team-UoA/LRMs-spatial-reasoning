PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze the relationships and find the possible relationships between x and z.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary

Now I need to determine what relationship(s) x and z can have. Let's analyze this systematically:

1. Can x be disconnected from z (DC)? 
   If x is disconnected from z, then x and z share no spatial parts. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least that part. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. Can x be externally connected to z (EC)?
   For x to be externally connected to z, they would need to touch only at their boundaries. But since y is contained in both x and z, they must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. Can x partially overlap z (PO)?
   This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained within the other. Since y is contained in both x and z, they definitely share some parts. It's possible that x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in others. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)?
   This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. But we know y is completely contained in x (since NTPPi(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (since TPP(y,z)). This means x must also touch z's boundary. However, it's not clear if x must be completely contained in z. If x extends beyond z, then TPP(x,z) would not be possible. But if x is completely within z, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)?
   This would mean x is completely contained in z and does not touch z's boundary. But we know y touches z's boundary and y is contained in x, so x must also touch z's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)?
   This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. We know y is completely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), and y is completely contained in z (TPP(y,z)). It's possible that z extends all the way to x's boundary in some places, making TPPi(x,z) possible.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)?
   This would mean z is completely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary. While y does not touch x's boundary, z might. However, if z doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. Can x and z be equal (EQ)?
   If x and z are equal, then any part of one is a part of the other. We know y is a proper part of both x and z, so EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me reconsider some of these. I think I need to be more precise.

1. We have NTPPi(x,y), which means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. We have TPP(y,z), which means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected): This is not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least this part.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected): This is not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping): This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. Since y is part of both x and z, they definitely share some parts. Now, we need to determine if one can be completely contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z): This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. We know y is inside x and touches z's boundary. It's possible that x is completely inside z and also touches z's boundary precisely where y does. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z): This would mean x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But we know y is inside x and touches z's boundary, so x must also touch z's boundary (at least where y does). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. We know y is completely inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is completely inside x, then z would touch x's boundary, but y wouldn't. This seems consistent with our given information. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But we know y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y must be even further inside x and definitely wouldn't touch x's boundary. This seems consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal): If x and z are equal, then any part of one is a part of the other. We know y is a proper part of both x and z. However, we also know y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary. If x and z are equal, their boundaries would be the same, and y would either touch both or neither. Since y touches z's boundary but not x's, x and z cannot be equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me analyze this again more carefully. I think I made some errors above.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's go through each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected): This means x and z share no points. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the points in y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected): This means x and z touch only at their boundaries. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping): This means x and z share some points, but neither is completely contained in the other. We know x and z share at least the points in y. It's possible that x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in others. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z): This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. 

   Let's think about this. We know:
   - y is completely inside x (doesn't touch x's boundary)
   - y touches z's boundary
   
   If x is completely inside z, then the only way y can touch z's boundary is if x also touches z's boundary at the same point. This is consistent with TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z): This would mean x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. 

   If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) can't touch z's boundary either. But we know y does touch z's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. 

   We know y is inside z and y doesn't touch x's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, then there would be parts of z touching x's boundary, but y isn't one of those parts. This is consistent with our given information. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. 

   If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then no part of z, including y, would touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal): This would mean x and z occupy exactly the same space. 

   If x and z are equal, then their boundaries are the same. We know y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is a contradiction if x and z are equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me go through each of these cases again to make sure I'm considering all the information and being consistent.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected): If x and z are disconnected, they share no points. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the points in y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected): If x and z are externally connected, they touch only at their boundaries. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other. 

   We know x and z share at least the points in y. If parts of x extend beyond z and parts of z extend beyond x, then PO(x,z) would be true. Is this possible given our constraints?
   
   We know y is completely inside x and touches z's boundary. So, at the point where y touches z's boundary, x must also be present (since y is inside x). But this means x touches z's boundary as well. This doesn't contradict the PO relationship. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z): This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. 

   We know y is inside x and touches z's boundary. If x is completely inside z, it's possible that x touches z's boundary at the same point where y does. This is consistent with TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z): This would mean x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. 

   We know y is inside x and touches z's boundary. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y (being inside x) can't touch z's boundary either. This contradicts TPP(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. 

   We know y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, there would be parts of z that touch x's boundary, but y isn't one of those parts. This is consistent with our given information. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. 

   We know y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then no part of z, including y, would touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal): This would mean x and z occupy exactly the same space. 

   If x and z are equal, then their boundaries are the same. We know y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is a contradiction if x and z are equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me check one more time on the case of PO(x,z).

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some interior points, but neither can be completely contained in the other. 

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's see if PO(x,z) is consistent with these conditions:

1. We know y is inside both x and z, so x and z share at least the points in y. This satisfies the first condition of PO, that x and z share some interior points.

2. For PO(x,z) to be true, neither x nor z can be completely contained in the other. 

   - Can x be completely contained in z? From our analysis above for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), we determined that x could be completely contained in z (specifically for TPP(x,z)), so this condition is not guaranteed.
   
   - Can z be completely contained in x? From our analysis for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), we determined that z could be completely contained in x, so this condition is not guaranteed either.

So, we can't guarantee that neither x nor z is completely contained in the other, which means PO(x,z) is not a guaranteed relation. It's only possible if there are parts of x outside of z AND parts of z outside of x.

Actually, let me reconsider the nature of these relations. 

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary).

We want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected): x and z share no points.
   We know y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the points in y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected): x and z touch only at their boundaries.
   We know y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping): x and z share some points, but neither is completely contained in the other.
   We know x and z share at least the points in y. For PO(x,z) to be true, there must be parts of x outside of z AND parts of z outside of x.
   
   Is this possible? Let's see:
   
   - We know y is completely inside x and touches z's boundary. 
   - Since y touches z's boundary, and y is inside x, x must extend at least to that point on z's boundary.
   - But this doesn't mean x must be completely inside z; x could extend beyond z. So there could be parts of x outside of z.
   
   - Similarly, z need not be completely inside x. There could be parts of z outside of x.
   
   So, it's possible for there to be parts of x outside of z AND parts of z outside of x, making PO(x,z) a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z): x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.
   
   We know y is inside x and touches z's boundary. If x is completely inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at least where y does. This is consistent with TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z): x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   
   We know y is inside x and touches z's boundary. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y (being inside x) can't touch z's boundary either. This contradicts TPP(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary.
   
   We know y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, there would be parts of z touching x's boundary, but y is not one of those parts. This is consistent with our given information. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   
   We know y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then no part of z, including y, would touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal): x and z occupy exactly the same space.
   
   If x and z are equal, then their boundaries are the same. We know y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is a contradiction if x and z are equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

To be extra certain, let me reconsider each of these again:

1. PO(x,z) - This is possible because if there's a part of x outside of z, and a part of z outside of x, while they still overlap (due to at least containing y), then they would have a partial overlap.

2. TPP(x,z) - This is possible because if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary (which it can, since y touches z's boundary and y is inside x), then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

3. TPPi(x,z) - This is possible because if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary (which can happen if z extends to parts of x's boundary that y doesn't touch), then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

4. NTPPi(x,z) - Wait, let me double-check this. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. 

   We know:
   - y is inside z and y doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - y touches z's boundary.
   
   If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then how can y touch z's boundary? If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's boundary is entirely inside x (not touching x's boundary). If y touches z's boundary, and z's boundary is entirely inside x, then y is touching something inside x, not x's boundary. This is consistent with our given information. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, I still get the same four possible relationships: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's think even more carefully on the case of NTPPi(x,z). For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's reason through this step by step:

1. y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
3. If z is completely inside x, then y is definitely inside x (which is consistent with (1)).
4. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's boundary is entirely inside x.
5. y touches z's boundary (from (2)).
6. So, y touches a boundary that's entirely inside x, not x's boundary. This is consistent with (1).

So, it is possible for z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, meaning NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me double-check the other cases one by one to be sure:

1. PO(x,z) - For this to be true, x and z must share some points (which they do, at least through y), and neither can be completely contained in the other.

   We know:
   - y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   
   Can x be completely outside of z? We already ruled out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), so x and z must share interior points. But x need not be completely inside z. There could be parts of x outside of z.
   
   Can z be completely outside of x? Again, z and x must share interior points, but z need not be completely inside x. There could be parts of z outside of x.
   
   So, PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z) - For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and must touch z's boundary.

   We know:
   - y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   
   If x is completely inside z, then y is also inside z (which is consistent with (2)). If x touches z's boundary, and y is inside x, then y must be away from the parts of x that touch z's boundary. But we're told y touches z's boundary. If both x and y touch z's boundary, and y is inside x, this seems consistent. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. TPPi(x,z) - For this to be true, z must be completely inside x and must touch x's boundary.

   We know:
   - y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   
   If z is completely inside x, then y is also inside x (which is consistent with (1)). If z touches x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y must be away from the parts of z that touch x's boundary. This is consistent with (1). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

4. NTPPi(x,z) - For this to be true, z must be completely inside x and must not touch x's boundary.

   We know:
   - y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   
   If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's boundary is entirely inside x. If y touches z's boundary, then y is touching a boundary that's inside x, not x's boundary. This is consistent with (1). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me revisit the case of PO(x,z) to be sure. For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some interior points (which they do, through y), and neither can be completely contained in the other.

The question is: Can we guarantee that neither x nor z is completely contained in the other given our constraints? Let's see:

1. Is it possible for x to be completely contained in z? Yes, as we saw in the TPP(x,z) case.
2. Is it possible for z to be completely contained in x? Yes, as we saw in the TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) cases.

So, both of these situations are possible. But for PO(x,z) to be true, we need a scenario where x is not completely contained in z AND z is not completely contained in x. This is a third possibility, different from the two we just considered.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

For a scenario where neither x is completely contained in z nor z is completely contained in x:

- y is a shared part of both x and z.
- There are parts of x outside of z.
- There are parts of z outside of x.

Is this scenario consistent with our constraints? Let's see:

1. y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is given.
2. y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is given.
3. For parts of x to be outside of z, x must extend beyond z's boundary. This doesn't contradict our constraints.
4. For parts of z to be outside of x, z must extend beyond x's boundary. This doesn't contradict our constraints either.

So, a scenario where x and z partially overlap (neither is completely contained in the other) is consistent with our constraints. Therefore, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Let's create a picture to visualize the PO(x,z) scenario:

Imagine x as a large circle, z as another large circle that overlaps with x but neither is completely inside the other, and y as a small circle that's inside both x and z. y doesn't touch x's boundary (it's well inside x) but it does touch z's boundary (it reaches all the way to z's edge in at least one point).

This visualization helps confirm that PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Now, let me check each of the other possible relationships with a similar visualization:

1. TPP(x,z) - Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle completely inside z, and y as an even smaller circle inside x. y touches z's boundary at some point, and since y is inside x, x must also touch z's boundary at that same point. This visualization confirms that TPP(x,z) is possible.

2. TPPi(x,z) - Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle completely inside x, and y as an even smaller circle inside z. y doesn't touch x's boundary, but it touches z's boundary. And z touches x's boundary at some point. This visualization confirms that TPPi(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPPi(x,z) - Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y as an even smaller circle inside z. y doesn't touch x's boundary, but it touches z's boundary. This visualization confirms that NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me check whether the case TPP(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and must touch z's boundary.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x is completely inside z, then y (being inside x) is also inside z, which is consistent. If x touches z's boundary, it's still possible for y to touch z's boundary as well (they can touch it at the same point). So, TPP(x,z) is consistent with our constraints.

Are there any other possibilities we've missed? Let's go through each of the 8 RCC-8 relations again and see if we've ruled them out correctly:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the points in y.
2. EC(x,z) (externally connected) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior points, not just boundary points.
3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping) - Possible, as we've determined.
4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z) - Possible, as we've determined.
5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z) - Not possible because y touches z's boundary, and y is inside x, so x must also touch z's boundary (contradicting the non-tangential requirement).
6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x) - Possible, as we've determined.
7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x) - Possible, as we've determined.
8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal) - Not possible because y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, which would be a contradiction if x and z were equal.

So, after thorough analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I think I've been making a conceptual error. Let me carefully think about the setup again.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.
   - y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, the following is important: if y touches z's boundary, and y is entirely inside x, then x must "extend" to z's boundary at the point where y touches it. This means x also touches z's boundary.

Given this, let's carefully reconsider each of the 8 RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the points in y.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping) - This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other. We know x and z share the points in y, and we've determined that x touches z's boundary at some point. This is consistent with a PO relation. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z) - This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. We know x touches z's boundary at some point (where y does). If x is completely inside z, this would be consistent with a TPP relation. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z) - This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We've determined that x touches z's boundary at the point where y does, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x) - This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. We know y is inside z and y doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is completely inside x, then z must touch x's boundary at some point (to satisfy the tangential requirement). This is not contradicted by our constraints. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x) - This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then any part of z (including y) won't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal) - This means x and z occupy exactly the same space. If x and z are equal, then their boundaries are the same. We know y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is a contradiction if x and z are equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after careful analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me further elaborate on the PO(x,z) case, as it seems to be the most complex. For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some interior points (which they do, through y), and neither can be completely contained in the other.

The question is: Is it possible for x and z to have a relationship where neither is completely contained in the other, while still satisfying our constraints? Let's see:

We know:
- y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

For a PO(x,z) scenario:
- y is a shared interior part of both x and z.
- x extends beyond z in some areas.
- z extends beyond x in some areas.

Is this consistent with our constraints? Yes. The constraints don't specify the exact size or extent of x and z beyond their relationship with y. So it's entirely possible for x to extend beyond z in some areas and for z to extend beyond x in others.

Let's create a picture to visualize this:

Imagine a scenario where:
- y is a small circle
- x is a larger circle that completely contains y (with some space between y and x's boundary)
- z is another larger circle that completely contains y (with y touching z's boundary at some point)
- x and z overlap such that they both contain y, but x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in others.

This visualization confirms that PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

So, the final answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me just double-check whether each of these cases is compatible with the constraints.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

For the case of PO(x,z):
For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some points, but neither can be completely contained in the other. So in this case, we have:
- y is in the intersection of x and z, as it's contained in both.
- y is completely inside x, and therefore far from x's boundary.
- y touches z's boundary, which means z's boundary passes through the interior of x.
- This is all consistent with a scenario where x and z partially overlap.

For the case of TPP(x,z):
For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and must touch z's boundary. So in this case, we have:
- y is completely inside x, so it's also inside z (which is consistent).
- y touches z's boundary, and since y is inside x, x must also touch z's boundary at that point.
- This is consistent with x being a tangential proper part of z.

For the case of TPPi(x,z):
For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x and must touch x's boundary. So in this case, we have:
- y is completely inside z, which is completely inside x, so y is inside x (which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y)).
- y touches z's boundary, but since z is entirely inside x, and y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), we know the point where y touches z's boundary is not the same as where z touches x's boundary.
- This is consistent with z being a tangential proper part of x.

For the case of NTPPi(x,z):
For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x and must not touch x's boundary. So in this case, we have:
- y is completely inside z, which is completely inside x, so y is inside x (which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y)).
- y touches z's boundary, and z is entirely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- Since z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, y also doesn't touch x's boundary (which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y)).
- This is consistent with z being a non-tangential proper part of x.

All four relationships (PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z)) seem to be compatible with the given constraints. Therefore, they are all possible relationships between x and z.

So my answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary

Let me determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior points.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible because y is inside both x and z, so they must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. X and z share at least region y, but x could extend beyond z in some areas, and z could extend beyond x in others.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. Since y touches z's boundary and y is inside x, x must also touch z's boundary at that point. X could be completely contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible. If x were completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (being inside x) couldn't touch z's boundary either.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. Z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary at some point (not where y is).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible. Z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Y touches z's boundary but this doesn't contradict y being away from x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. Y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, which would be contradictory if x and z were identical.
