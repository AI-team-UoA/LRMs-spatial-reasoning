PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step by step.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (exactly the same region)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z and touches z's boundary)

I need to determine what relation holds between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), this means x and y are identical in terms of spatial extent. They occupy exactly the same region.

Since TPP(y,z), this means y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary.

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), it follows that x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, TPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

To double-check this reasoning, let's think about each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - impossible because x (which is identical to y) is part of z, not disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - impossible because x is not just touching z, it's part of z
3. PO(x,z) - impossible because x (which is identical to y) is completely contained in z, not partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - this is the correct relation since x is identical to y, and y is a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z) - impossible because TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary, so x must also touch z's boundary
6. TPPi(x,z) - impossible because this would mean z is part of x, which contradicts TPP(y,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z) - impossible for the same reason as TPPi
8. EQ(x,z) - impossible because TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z, not equal to z

So the only possible relation is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think through this again to be absolutely sure.

If EQ(x,y), then x and y are spatially identical.
If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z.

Since x and y are identical, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

So TPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relation holds between x and z based on the given information.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same region)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical in terms of spatial extent, and TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary, it follows that x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does.

Since x is identical to y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
