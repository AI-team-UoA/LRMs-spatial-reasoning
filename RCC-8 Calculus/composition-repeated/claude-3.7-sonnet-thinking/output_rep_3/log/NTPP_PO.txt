PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We're given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither is contained in the other

We need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Let's visualize this. NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary. PO(y,z) means y and z share some common area, but each also has parts not shared with the other.

Given these constraints, what can the relationship between x and z be?

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) and analyze whether they're possible:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
   Can x and z have no common parts? Since x is completely inside y, and y shares some parts with z, it's possible that x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So DC(x,z) seems possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   Can x touch z's boundary without sharing interior? Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), and z and y only partially overlap, it seems unlikely that x could precisely touch z's boundary without going outside y. This seems impossible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap:
   Can x and z share some parts but not others? If x is in the overlapping region of y and z, then x would share parts with z. But since x is completely within y, it can't extend beyond y into parts of z that don't overlap with y. So x could be partially in the overlap region, making PO(x,z) possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   Can x be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary? Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), and z may not completely contain y, it seems unlikely that x could touch z's boundary while staying inside y. This seems impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   Can x be completely inside z without touching its boundary? If z includes all of x and more, this is possible. It would mean that the overlap between y and z completely contains x. So NTPP(x,z) seems possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   Can z be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary? Since x is completely inside y, and z extends beyond y (from PO(y,z)), z cannot be contained within x. This is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   Can z be completely inside x without touching its boundary? Again, since x is within y and z extends beyond y, z cannot be contained within x. This is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   Can x and z be identical? Since z partially overlaps with y and extends beyond it, while x is completely within y, they cannot be identical. This is impossible.

Wait, I need to be more careful about my reasoning. Let me reconsider some of these.

For TPP(x,z), I said it was impossible because x doesn't touch y's boundary. But that doesn't necessarily mean x can't touch z's boundary. Let me think more carefully.

If x is in the overlapping region between y and z, and that region happens to include part of z's boundary, then x could touch z's boundary while being completely inside y. So TPP(x,z) might be possible after all.

Actually, let me redo this analysis more carefully.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap

For each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   If x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z share no parts. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   For x to externally connect with z, they would need to touch at their boundaries. But since x is NTPP to y, x doesn't touch y's boundary. The only way x could touch z's boundary is if that boundary runs through the interior of y. Since PO(y,z), z's boundary does indeed cut through y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

   Actually, I think I made an error here. If x is NTPP to y, then x is completely inside y with some margin. For x to touch z's boundary, x would have to extend all the way to where z's boundary enters y. But if x touches that boundary, then x would no longer be NTPP to y; it would be TPP to y. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

   Let me rethink this. NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary. It doesn't prevent x from touching the boundary of z that happens to run through the interior of y. So EC(x,z) seems possible after all.

   Wait, I need to be very careful here. For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. If z's boundary cuts through the interior of y, and x touches that boundary, then x would be touching z's boundary. But for EC to hold, x and z must not share any interior points. This means x must be entirely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, but touch z's boundary. 

   Actually, I think EC(x,z) is impossible. Here's why: For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. If x is NTPP to y, then x is completely inside y with some margin from y's boundary. For x to touch z's boundary without sharing interior with z, z's boundary would have to penetrate into y exactly to the boundary of x. But if z's boundary reaches the boundary of x, and x doesn't share interior with z, then x must be in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. But for z's boundary to reach x, it must pass through the interior of y, which means there's a zone of overlap between y and z. If x is in this zone, then x shares interior with z, which contradicts EC. If x is not in this zone, then x doesn't touch z's boundary, which also contradicts EC.

   So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap:
   If part of x is in the overlapping region of y and z, and part of x is in the region of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   For TPP(x,z) to hold, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since x is NTPP to y, x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If the overlap between y and z completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary within that overlap, then TPP(x,z) would hold.

   Let me think: If z overlaps with y and extends beyond it, and x touches the boundary of z that runs through the interior of y, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   If the overlap between y and z completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary within that overlap, then NTPP(x,z) would hold. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Since PO(y,z), z extends beyond y in some parts. But since x is completely inside y (from NTPP(x,y)), z cannot be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   Similar to TPPi, since z extends beyond y, it cannot be completely inside x, which is inside y. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z must be identical. But since x is completely inside y and z extends beyond y, they cannot be identical. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

I think I'm overthinking the EC case. Let me reconsider it again.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. If x is NTPP to y, then x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For x to touch z's boundary, z's boundary must pass through the interior of y. But if x touches z's boundary without sharing interior points with z, x must be entirely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. But for z's boundary to reach x, it must pass through the interior of y, which means there's a zone of overlap between y and z. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, OK. I'm still not convinced about the EC case. Let me try a different approach. Maybe a concrete example would help.

Imagine y as a large circle. Inside y, we have x as a smaller circle that doesn't touch the boundary of y. Now, z could be another shape that partially overlaps with y. For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points.

Let's place x in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z, but right at the edge of where y and z overlap. In this scenario, the boundary of z might just touch the boundary of x, while z's interior is outside of x. This would satisfy EC(x,z).

But I just realized a problem with this example. If x is right at the edge of where y and z overlap, and z's boundary touches x's boundary, then the boundary of z runs through the interior of y. This is because x, being NTPP to y, is completely inside y with some margin. So, the boundary of z that touches x's boundary is inside y. This means there's a zone of overlap between y and z, and if x's boundary touches z's boundary, then x is partially in this overlap zone, which means x shares interior points with z. This contradicts EC, which requires that x and z touch only at their boundaries.

Actually, let me create an example where EC(x,z) holds. Imagine y as a large circle. Inside y, we have x as a smaller circle that doesn't touch the boundary of y. Now, z is shaped like a "C", with the opening of the C just touching the edge of x. The rest of z doesn't overlap with x, but it does overlap with other parts of y. This would make PO(y,z) true, and it would also make EC(x,z) true.

Wait, I think I see the issue now. If x is NTPP to y, and z's boundary touches x's boundary inside y, then z is "invading" the interior of y. This overlap between y and z is consistent with PO(y,z), and it allows for EC(x,z) to be possible.

Let me double-check: For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. If z's boundary touches x's boundary inside y, they're touching but not sharing interior. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I was confusing myself. Let's go back to basics.

PO(y,z) means that y and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. So there's a region of overlap between y and z, a region of y that doesn't overlap with z, and a region of z that doesn't overlap with y.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, for EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. This means x must be entirely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, but touch z's boundary.

Is this possible? Let's see: If x is entirely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, and z's boundary touches x's boundary, then there's a point on z's boundary that's inside y (because it's on x's boundary, and x is inside y). This point is in the overlap region of y and z, which is consistent with PO(y,z).

So, I think EC(x,z) is possible.

Actually, no, that's wrong. Let me think this through again.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. This means there's a point p that's on both the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

Now, since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So, the point p is inside y. Since p is on the boundary of z, it's on the boundary of the overlap region between y and z. But since p is inside y, it's not on the boundary of y. This means the boundary of z at point p is inside y. But if p is on the boundary of x, which is inside y, and p is also on the boundary of z, then x and z share a point of their boundaries. But this doesn't guarantee that they don't share interior points.

Let me think about it differently. If the boundary of z cuts through the interior of y, it could potentially touch the boundary of x without z's interior overlapping with x. This would make EC(x,z) true.

So, I think EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, I really think this isn't going to be settled this way. Let me try to draw a different example to see if EC(x,z) is possible.

Imagine y as a large circle. Inside y, we have x as a smaller circle that doesn't touch the boundary of y. Now, z is a shape that partially overlaps with y. For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points.

Let's place x in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z, but right at the edge of where y and z overlap. In this scenario, the boundary of z might just touch the boundary of x, while z's interior is outside of x. This would satisfy EC(x,z).

But here's the issue: If x is at the edge of where y and z overlap, then the boundary of z passes through the interior of y. This is consistent with PO(y,z). But if the boundary of z touches the boundary of x, then z's interior is very close to x's interior. In fact, if we move infinitesimally from the point of contact, we'd be inside both x and z, which would mean they share interior points. This contradicts EC, which requires that they touch only at their boundaries.

So, I think EC(x,z) is not possible after all.

Actually, I think I'm not visualizing this correctly. Let me reconsider the definition of the relations more carefully.

EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means the interiors of x and z are disjoint, but their boundaries intersect.

Now, if the boundary of z cuts through the interior of y, it could potentially touch the boundary of x without z's interior overlapping with x. This would make EC(x,z) true.

I think the source of my confusion is the notion of a "boundary" in the RCC-8 calculus. The boundary of a region is a set of points that are not in the interior of the region. Two regions can touch at a boundary without sharing interior points.

So, I think EC(x,z) is possible.

OK actually let me be more clear about all the relations.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y but does not touch y's boundary. So x is completely inside y with some margin from y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. So there's a region of overlap between y and z, a region of y that doesn't overlap with z, and a region of z that doesn't overlap with y.

Now, let's consider all possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   This means x and z share no points. If x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z are disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. For this to happen, x must be in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, but the boundary of x must touch the boundary of z. Since the boundary of z cuts through the interior of y (because of PO(y,z)), it's possible for the boundary of z to touch the boundary of x without z's interior overlapping with x. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap:
   This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. If part of x is in the overlapping region of y and z, and part of x is in the region of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If the overlap between y and z completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary within that overlap, then TPP(x,z) would hold. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If the overlap between y and z completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary within that overlap, then NTPP(x,z) would hold. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Since PO(y,z), z extends beyond y in some parts. But since x is completely inside y (from NTPP(x,y)), z cannot be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, since z extends beyond y, it cannot be completely inside x, which is inside y. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   This means x and z are identical. Since x is completely inside y and z extends beyond y, they cannot be identical. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm still not convinced about EC(x,z). Let me think about it one more time.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. If x is NTPP to y, then x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For x to touch z's boundary, z's boundary must pass through the interior of y. But, the point where x touches z is on the boundary of both x and z. This means it's a point of tangency.

Now, if x and z are tangent at a point, and x is inside y, then z must have a part that's inside y. This is consistent with PO(y,z). But the question is: Can x and z be tangent without sharing interior points?

Let's think about it geometrically. If x and z are tangent at a point, they touch at exactly one point. At this point, the boundaries of x and z are tangent, meaning they have the same tangent line. This means that, locally around the point of tangency, x is on one side of the tangent line and z is on the other side. This ensures that they don't share interior points.

So, I think EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

Alright, after all this back-and-forth, I'm confident in my answer. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

The impossible relationships are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

This makes sense: x cannot contain z because x is inside y and z extends beyond y. But all other relationships where x is either disconnected from, touching, overlapping, or inside z are possible.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither containing the other.

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can be positioned so it just touches z's boundary where z cuts through y's interior.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap with the intersection of y and z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z while touching z's boundary (where that boundary runs through y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely contained within the overlapping region of y and z, not touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible - since x is inside y and z extends beyond y, z cannot be contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible - same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible - x and z cannot be identical since z extends beyond y while x is completely inside y.
