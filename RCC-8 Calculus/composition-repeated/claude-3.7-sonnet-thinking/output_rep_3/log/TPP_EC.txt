PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

To answer this question, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between regions x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's recall what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. So y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, I need to consider what relationships are possible between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: x and z share no points.
   Since x is contained in y (TPP(x,y)), and y only touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), it's possible that x doesn't touch z at all. This would happen if x is in a part of y that's away from where y and z touch.
   So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
   Since x touches y's boundary (TPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (EC(y,z)), it's possible that x touches z exactly at the same point where y touches z.
   So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
   This is not possible because x is entirely contained in y (TPP(x,y)), and y doesn't share any interior points with z (EC(y,z)). So x cannot share interior points with z.
   So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
   This is not possible because x is entirely contained in y (TPP(x,y)), and y only touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)). So x cannot be contained in z.
   So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   Like with TPP, this is not possible because x is entirely contained in y, and y only touches z at the boundary.
   So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
   This would mean z is contained in x. But since TPP(x,y), x is contained in y. So this would imply z is contained in y, which contradicts EC(y,z).
   So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   For similar reasons as TPPi, this is not possible.
   So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: x and z occupy the same space.
   This would mean x and z are the same region. But since TPP(x,y), x is properly contained in y. And since EC(y,z), z is external to y. These are contradictory if x and z are the same.
   So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z) - disconnected
- EC(x,z) - externally connected

Let me double-check by thinking about it differently.

If TPP(x,y), then x is contained within y and touches y's boundary. If EC(y,z), then y and z touch only at their boundaries.

Now, considering x and z:
- Since x is contained in y, and y only touches z at the boundary, x could be positioned in y such that it doesn't touch z at all, leading to DC(x,z).
- Alternatively, x could touch y's boundary at exactly the point where y touches z, leading to EC(x,z).

Given that x is confined to y and y only touches z at the boundary, these are the only two possible relationships between x and z.

So, my answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, which means they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This would mean x and z don't share any points. Since x is contained in y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z only at the boundary, it's possible that x doesn't touch the specific part of y's boundary where y touches z. In this case, x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that TPP(x,y), x touches y's boundary. If x touches y's boundary at the specific point where y touches z, then x would also touch z's boundary, resulting in EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This would mean x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since x is entirely contained in y, and y doesn't share any interior points with z (due to EC(y,z)), it's not possible for x to share interior points with z. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since x is contained in y, and y only touches z at the boundary, x cannot be a proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For similar reasons as TPP, this is not possible. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z is not contained in y. And since TPP(x,y), x is contained in y. So, z cannot be contained in x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For similar reasons as TPPi, this is not possible. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This would mean x and z occupy the same space. Since TPP(x,y), x is properly contained in y. And since EC(y,z), z is not contained in y. So, x and z cannot occupy the same space. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Wait, actually let me double check by considering a concrete example:

Imagine y is a circle. Given TPP(x,y), x is a smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y at least one point. Now, let's introduce z, which, given EC(y,z), is another circle touching y only at the boundary.

If x touches y's boundary at a point different from where y touches z, then x and z don't share any points, so DC(x,z).

If x touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z, then x and z touch at a single point, so EC(x,z).

So, it seems my conclusion is correct: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given the provided constraints.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Since x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y only touches z at the boundary, there are two possibilities:

   a) x touches y's boundary at the exact point where y touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at their boundaries, resulting in EC(x,z).

   b) x touches y's boundary at a different point than where y touches z. In this case, x and z would be completely disconnected, resulting in DC(x,z).

2. No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
   - x cannot overlap with z since y and z don't share interior points
   - x cannot be part of z since x is contained in y
   - z cannot be part of x since z is outside y
