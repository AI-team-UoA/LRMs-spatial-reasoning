PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's recall the definition of TPP:
TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Since x is part of y, and y is part of z, we can infer that x is part of z by transitivity. But we need to determine whether x touches z's boundary.

Let's consider two possible cases:

Case 1: x touches z's boundary.
If x touches z's boundary, then x would be a "tangential proper part" of z, which means TPP(x,z).

Case 2: x does not touch z's boundary.
If x does not touch z's boundary, then x would be a "non-tangential proper part" of z, which means NTPP(x,z).

Both cases are possible. Let me reason through an example to see if there are any other possibilities:

Imagine z as a large circle, y as a medium circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and x as a small circle inside y.

If x is positioned so that it also touches z's boundary (at the same point where y touches z), then TPP(x,z).
If x is positioned so that it's entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

I don't see any other possible relationships between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So the possible relationships are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check by considering the definitions more carefully:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which means:
1. x is a proper part of y (all of x is inside y, but x is not equal to y)
2. x touches the boundary of y

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which means:
1. y is a proper part of z (all of y is inside z, but y is not equal to z)
2. y touches the boundary of z

Given these, we know that x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x is definitely inside z. The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

Since y touches the boundary of z, and x touches the boundary of y, there are two possibilities:
1. x touches y at the same point where y touches z, which means x also touches z's boundary. In this case, TPP(x,z).
2. x touches y's boundary at a point that is not where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Let me think about whether there are any other possibilities. Could x and z be related by any of the other relations?

- DC(x,z)? No, because x is inside y and y is inside z, so x cannot be disconnected from z.
- EC(x,z)? No, because x is inside y and y is inside z, so x cannot merely touch the boundary of z without being inside it.
- PO(x,z)? No, because x is inside y and y is inside z, so x is completely inside z and cannot partially overlap with it.
- TPPi(x,z)? No, because TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, but we know that x is inside z, not the other way around.
- NTPPi(x,z)? No, because NTPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, but we know that x is inside z, not the other way around.
- EQ(x,z)? No, because x is inside y and y is inside z, and y is not equal to z, so x cannot be equal to z.

So the only possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

To summarize, given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
2. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what happens when we have TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Since x is part of y, and y is part of z, we know x must be part of z by transitivity. The question is whether x touches z's boundary or not.

Two scenarios are possible:
1. If x touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary, then x will also touch z's boundary, giving us TPP(x,z).
2. If x touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x will be completely in the interior of z, giving us NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relation is possible in this situation.
