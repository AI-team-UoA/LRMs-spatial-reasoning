PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. We know that EC(x,y), which means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. We know that PO(y,z), which means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now, we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z. The possible RCC-8 relations are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

Let me visualize these relationships and see which ones are possible:

For EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
For PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

Now, let's consider different possible arrangements:

1. DC(x,z):
   Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if x touches y at one boundary, and z overlaps with y on a different part that doesn't include the boundary where x and y touch.

2. EC(x,z):
   Can x and z touch at a boundary? Yes, if x touches y at a boundary, and z overlaps with y in such a way that z also shares that same boundary with x.

3. PO(x,z):
   Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if x touches y at a boundary, and z overlaps with y in such a way that z also overlaps with x.

4. TPP(x,z):
   Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. Given that x only touches y at a boundary, and y and z partially overlap, it seems unlikely that x could be completely inside z. But actually, it could be possible if z completely contains x and extends beyond y.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Given that x touches y at a boundary, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that z completely contains x and also extends beyond y in all directions.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y and z partially overlap, and x only touches y at a boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be completely inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given that y and z partially overlap, and x only touches y at a boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be completely inside x.

8. EQ(x,z):
   Can x and z be equal? Given that x only touches y at a boundary, and y and z partially overlap, it seems unlikely that x and z could be equal.

Let me refine my analysis:

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need to consider different ways x and z can relate.

1. DC(x,z): If x touches y at a boundary, and z overlaps with y in a region that doesn't include that boundary, then x and z will be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): If x touches y at a boundary, and z overlaps with y in such a way that z also touches that same boundary, then x and z will touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, z would need to extend beyond the boundary where x and y touch, and into x. However, given that x and y only touch at a boundary and don't share interior parts, it's hard to see how z could overlap with x.

Hmm, this is more complex than I initially thought. Let me rethink this carefully.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior points.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y in an area that doesn't extend to the boundary where x and y touch.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y in such a way that z reaches the boundary where x and y touch.

3. PO(x,z): For this to be true, x and z need to share some interior points. Given that x and y only touch at a boundary, z would need to overlap with both y and x. But since x and y don't share interior points, z can't overlap with both x and y's interiors.

Wait, that's not quite right. Let me reconsider. It's possible that z extends beyond y in such a way that it overlaps with x.

Actually, I think I need to be more methodical. Let's consider a simple case to help understand:

Imagine x and y as two circles that touch at a single point, which satisfies EC(x,y). Now, z could be a circle that overlaps with y, which satisfies PO(y,z).

Now, depending on where z is positioned, we can have different relationships between x and z:

1. If z is positioned such that it doesn't reach the point where x and y touch, then DC(x,z).
2. If z is positioned such that it just reaches the point where x and y touch, then EC(x,z).
3. If z is positioned such that it overlaps with both x and y, then PO(x,z).
4. If z completely contains x and also overlaps with y (but doesn't completely contain y), then NTPP(x,z) or TPP(x,z).
5. If x completely contains z and z overlaps with y (but z doesn't completely contain y), then NTPPi(x,z) or TPPi(x,z).
6. If x and z are the same region, then EQ(x,z).

Oh wait, I don't think my visualization is correct. If x and y are two circles touching at a single point, then x and y are externally connected, which satisfies EC(x,y). But in this case, z cannot simultaneously overlap with y (PO(y,z)) and be either a proper part of x or have x as its proper part. So, TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) might not be possible. And since x and y touch only at a boundary, and y and z overlap, it seems unlikely that x and z would be equal.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let me try a different approach.

For EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary.
For PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Now, for the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected if z overlaps with y in a region away from where x and y touch.
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at a boundary if z overlaps with y in such a way that z also touches the boundary of x.
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap if z extends beyond y and into x.
4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and also overlaps with y.
5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and extends beyond it in all directions, and also overlaps with y.
6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and touch the boundary of x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y only touches x at a boundary, it's hard to see how z could be completely inside x. I think this is not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y only touches x at a boundary, it's hard to see how z could be completely inside x. I think this is not possible.
8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the exact same region. Given that y and z overlap, and y and x only touch at a boundary, it's hard to see how x and z could be equal. I think this is not possible.

Actually, I'm not being precise enough here. Let me refine my understanding further.

In the RCC-8 calculus, regions are considered to be sets of points in a topological space. Two regions are externally connected (EC) if they share at least one point but their interiors don't overlap. Two regions partially overlap (PO) if they share some points, but neither is a subset of the other.

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's think step by step:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. If z overlaps with y but doesn't extend to the boundary where x and y touch, then x and z will be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. If z overlaps with y and just reaches the boundary where x and y touch, then x and z will be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): This is a bit trickier. For x and z to partially overlap, they need to share some interior points, but neither can be a subset of the other. Given that x and y touch only at a boundary, it's not immediately obvious if z can overlap with both x and y. However, z could potentially extend beyond y and into x. So, PO(x,z) might be possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be a proper subset of z and share at least one boundary point with z. It's hard to see how this could be the case given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z). But I'm not sure I can rule it out without a more formal proof.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be a proper subset of z and not share any boundary points with z. Again, it's hard to see how this could be the case given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be a proper subset of x and share at least one boundary point with x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y only touches x at a boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be a proper subset of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be a proper subset of x and not share any boundary points with x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y only touches x at a boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be a proper subset of x.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the exact same region. Given that y and z overlap, and y and x only touch at a boundary, it seems unlikely that x and z could be equal.

I'm now realizing that I need to be more methodical. Let me revisit the RCC-8 composition table, which lists the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given the relations between x and y, and y and z.

For RCC-8, the composition of EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) results in the possible relations between x and z.

Looking at the composition table, the possible relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But I don't have the table in front of me, so I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me try to reason through it more carefully.

Given EC(x,y), x and y share at least one boundary point but no interior points.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.

Now, let's reason through the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y but doesn't extend to the boundary where x and y touch.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y and extends just to the boundary where x and y touch.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they need to share some interior points, but neither can be a subset of the other. Given that x and y touch only at a boundary, it's not immediately obvious if z can overlap with both x and y. But now I'm thinking: PO means that y and z overlap in their interiors, and EC means that x and y touch at a boundary. So, there's no direct connection between the interior of x and the interior of z. I'm leaning towards saying PO(x,z) is not possible, but I'm not entirely confident.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be a proper subset of z and share at least one boundary point with z. Given that x and y touch at a boundary, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that z could completely contain x and also overlap with y. So, TPP(x,z) might be possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be a proper subset of z and not share any boundary points with z. Given that x and y touch at a boundary, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that z could completely contain x and extend beyond it in all directions, and also overlap with y. So, NTPP(x,z) might be possible.

I'm still not sure about TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z). Let me think about these more.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be a proper subset of x and share at least one boundary point with x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y only touches x at a boundary, it seems difficult for z to be a proper subset of x.

But wait, let me think of a specific example: imagine y is a circle, x is another circle that touches y at a single point, and z is a small circle that is mostly inside x but slightly overlaps with y. In this case, z would be a proper subset of x and would touch the boundary of x, satisfying TPPi(x,z). And z would also partially overlap with y, satisfying PO(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) might be possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be a proper subset of x and not share any boundary points with x. Using a similar example as above, z could be a small circle completely inside x and not touching the boundary of x, while still overlapping with y. So, NTPPi(x,z) might be possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the exact same region. Given that y and z overlap, and y and x only touch at a boundary, it seems unlikely that x and z could be equal. But I'm not sure I can rule it out without a more formal proof.

I've now argued that all the relations might be possible, which is a bit confusing. Let me reason through this more carefully.

Given EC(x,y), x and y share at least one boundary point but no interior points.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.

Now, let's reason through the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y but doesn't extend to the boundary where x and y touch. This makes sense and should be a valid scenario.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y and extends just to the boundary where x and y touch. This makes sense and should be a valid scenario.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they need to share some interior points, but neither can be a subset of the other. Given that x and y touch only at a boundary (and don't share interior points), and y and z share some interior points, it's not immediately obvious if z can overlap with x. 

Actually, let me be more precise. If z overlaps with y in its interior, and y only touches x at a boundary, then z cannot overlap with the interior of x through y. However, z could potentially extend beyond y and into x, creating a partial overlap. So, PO(x,z) might be possible.

Wait, I'm now doubting myself. Let me think of a concrete example: Imagine y as a circle, x as another circle that touches y at a single point, and z as a third circle that overlaps with y. For z to partially overlap with x, it would need to extend into x, but if x and y only touch at a boundary, how would z get into x without going through y? I think I was confusing myself.

Since x and y touch only at a boundary, and y and z share some interior points, z can't overlap with the interior of x without going through the interior of y, which is not connected to the interior of x. I've been going back and forth, but now I'm leaning towards PO(x,z) not being possible.

Wait, I just had a realization. If y and z partially overlap, then z doesn't have to be completely contained within y. It could extend beyond y. If x and y touch at a boundary, then z could potentially extend beyond y and into x, creating a partial overlap between x and z. So, PO(x,z) might be possible.

OK, this is getting complex. Let me draw out some scenarios explicitly.

Scenario 1: Imagine x and y as two 2D rectangles that touch at a single edge. They're externally connected, satisfying EC(x,y). Now, imagine z as a rectangle that overlaps with a part of y, away from the edge where x and y touch. In this case, x and z would be disconnected, satisfying DC(x,z).

Scenario 2: Imagine the same setup as above, but now z extends all the way to the edge where x and y touch. In this case, x and z would be externally connected, satisfying EC(x,z).

Scenario 3: Imagine the same setup, but now z extends beyond the edge where x and y touch, into the interior of x. In this case, x and z would partially overlap, satisfying PO(x,z).

Scenario 4: Imagine z as a rectangle that completely contains x and also partially overlaps with y. In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z, satisfying TPP(x,z).

Scenario 5: Imagine z as a rectangle that completely contains x, extends beyond x in all directions, and also partially overlaps with y. In this case, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, satisfying NTPP(x,z).

Scenario 6: Imagine x as a rectangle, y as a smaller rectangle that touches x at a single edge, and z as an even smaller rectangle that is mostly inside x but slightly overlaps with y. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, satisfying TPPi(x,z).

Scenario 7: Imagine x as a rectangle, y as a smaller rectangle that touches x at a single edge, and z as an even smaller rectangle that is completely inside x (not touching the boundary of x) but slightly overlaps with y. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, satisfying NTPPi(x,z).

Scenario 8: This is trickier. For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the exact same region. But if y and z partially overlap, and y and x only touch at a boundary, it seems hard for x and z to be the same region. I'm leaning towards EQ(x,z) not being possible, but I'm not entirely confident.

Actually, wait, I think I'm making this too complex. Let me think of EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) in terms of sets of points.

Given EC(x,y), x and y share at least one boundary point but no interior points.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.

Now, let's reason through the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y but doesn't include the boundary where x and y touch. Example: x and y are touching squares, z is a square that overlaps with part of y away from the touching boundary.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y and includes the boundary where x and y touch. Example: x and y are touching squares, z is a square that overlaps with part of y and extends to the touching boundary.

3. PO(x,z): For this to be true, x and z need to share some interior points, but neither can be a subset of the other. Given that x and y don't share interior points, it's hard for z to share interior points with both x and y. However, z could potentially extend beyond y and into the interior of x. Example: x and y are touching squares, z is a square that overlaps with part of y and extends past the touching boundary into x.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be a proper subset of z and share a boundary point with z. Given the constraints, this could happen if z completely contains x and also overlaps with y. Example: x is a square, y is a square that touches x at a single edge, and z is a large square that completely contains x and also overlaps with part of y.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be a proper subset of z and not share any boundary points with z. Given the constraints, this could happen if z completely contains x, extends beyond x in all directions, and also overlaps with y. Example: x is a square, y is a square that touches x at a single edge, and z is a very large square that completely contains x, extends beyond x in all directions, and also overlaps with part of y.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z would need to be a proper subset of x and share a boundary point with x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y touches x at a boundary, it's challenging to see how z could be a proper subset of x.

But wait, I think there might be a scenario: x is a square, y is a square that touches x at a single edge, and z is a small square that is mostly inside x but slightly overlaps with y. In this case, z would be mostly inside x and would touch the boundary of x, satisfying TPPi(x,z). And z would also partially overlap with y, satisfying PO(y,z).

Actually, I now realize the mistake in my reasoning. In the scenario I just described, if z is mostly inside x but slightly overlaps with y, then z is not properly contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not satisfied. 

Wait, there could still be a valid scenario: imagine x is a square, y is a square that touches x at a single edge, and z is a small square that is inside x and touches the boundary of x, but not the same boundary that y touches. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, satisfying TPPi(x,z). But for z to also partially overlap with y, it would need to extend outside of x into y, which contradicts it being a proper part of x.

I think TPPi(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar reasoning applies here. For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be a proper subset of x and not share any boundary points with x. But if z overlaps with y, and y touches x at a boundary, it's challenging to see how z could be a proper subset of x.

Using the same logic as above, if z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, it would satisfy NTPPi(x,z). But for z to also partially overlap with y, it would need to extend outside of x into y, which contradicts it being a proper part of x.

I think NTPPi(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the exact same region. Given that y and z partially overlap, and y and x only touch at a boundary, it seems challenging for x and z to be the same region.

But wait, I think there might be a scenario: if y touches x at a single point (or set of points), and z overlaps with y but also is exactly the same as x, then EQ(x,z) would be satisfied. 

Hmm, that's problematic though. If z is the same as x, and y touches x at a boundary, then z would also touch y at a boundary, not partially overlap with it. 

I think EQ(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)

But I'm not entirely confident in my reasoning, especially for PO(x,z).

OK, let me be a bit more systematic. First, I want to recall the exact meanings of all the relationships in RCC-8:

1. DC(x,y): x and y share no points.
2. EC(x,y): x and y share some boundary points but no interior points.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y and shares at least one boundary point with y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y and does not share any boundary points with y.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x and shares at least one boundary point with x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x and does not share any boundary points with x.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are the same set of points.

Now, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), let's systematically reason through each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y but doesn't include any of the boundary points where x and y touch. Example: x and y are touching circles, z is a circle that overlaps with part of y away from the touching point.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with y and includes a boundary point where x and y touch. Example: x and y are touching circles, z is a circle that overlaps with part of y and extends to the touching point.

3. PO(x,z): For this to be true, x and z need to share some interior points, but neither can be a subset of the other. Given that x and y don't share interior points, it's challenging for z to share interior points with both x and y. 

But let's think about it differently: If z overlaps with y in the interior, and then extends to the boundary where x and y touch, and then further extends into the interior of x, then z would share interior points with both x and y. This would satisfy PO(x,z).

Actually, for this, we have to assume that the boundary shared by x and y is not just a 'point' but a region itself with some points. Then, z could overlap with y in the interior, extend to the boundary, and then further into x, sharing interior points with both.

On second thought, I believe the RCC-8 calculus is typically applied to regions in a topological space, where regions are considered to be sets of points. In this context, boundaries are not separate entities but are parts of the regions. So, if x and y touch at a boundary, it means they share some points. And if z overlaps with y and extends to the boundary where x and y touch, it could potentially share points with both x and y.

Let's consider a 2D example: Imagine x and y as two squares that touch at a single edge. They're externally connected, satisfying EC(x,y). Now, imagine z as a square that overlaps with a part of y, and also extends past the edge where x and y touch, into the interior of x. In this case, z would share interior points with both x and y, satisfying PO(x,z) and PO(y,z).

I think PO(x,z) is possible, but I'm not 100% sure. It depends on the exact formalization of the RCC-8 calculus and the nature of the regions under consideration.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be a proper subset of z and share a boundary point with z. Given the constraints, this could happen if z completely contains x and also overlaps with y. Example: x is a square, y is a square that touches x at a single edge, and z is a large square that completely contains x and also overlaps with part of y.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be a proper subset of z and not share any boundary points with z. Given the constraints, this could happen if z completely contains x, extends beyond x in all directions, and also overlaps with y. Example: x is a square, y is a square that touches x at a single edge, and z is a very large square that completely contains x, extends beyond x in all directions, and also overlaps with part of y.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z would need to be a proper subset of x and share a boundary point with x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y touches x at a boundary, it's challenging to see how z could be a proper subset of x. If z overlaps with y, then it contains some points of y. If y touches x at a boundary, then they share some boundary points. But for z to be a proper subset of x, it would need to be completely contained within x, which contradicts it overlapping with y.

I believe TPPi(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar reasoning applies here. For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be a proper subset of x and not share any boundary points with x. But if z overlaps with y, and y touches x at a boundary, it's challenging to see how z could be a proper subset of x.

I believe NTPPi(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the exact same region. Given that y and z partially overlap, and y and x only touch at a boundary, it seems challenging for x and z to be the same region. If z is the same as x, and y touches x at a boundary, then z would also touch y at a boundary, not partially overlap with it.

I believe EQ(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Based on my systematic analysis, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)

I'm not 100% confident about PO(x,z), but I believe it's possible based on the example I provided. The other relationships seem more straightforward.

Actually, let me think about the tangential relations more.

For TPP(x,z), we have:
- x is a proper subset of z.
- x shares at least one boundary point with z.

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is TPP(x,z) possible?
If x is a proper subset of z, then all points of x are in z. If y touches x at a boundary, then y shares some boundary points with x. Since z overlaps with y, z contains some points of y. It's possible that z completely contains x and also extends to include some points of y. Example: x is a square, y is a square that touches x at a single edge, and z is a large square that completely contains x and also overlaps with part of y.

Actually, wait, I need to ensure the correct boundary relationships. For TPP(x,z), x needs to share a boundary point with z. Given EC(x,y), x shares some boundary points with y. For TPP(x,z) to be true, it's not just that x is contained in z, but also that x touches the boundary of z. This means some boundary points of x are also boundary points of z.

Hmm, actually, x can be tangentially contained in z, meaning the points where x touches the boundary of z don't have to be the same points where x touches y. So, I think TPP(x,z) can be possible.

Now, for NTPP(x,z), we have:
- x is a proper subset of z.
- x does not share any boundary points with z.

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is NTPP(x,z) possible?
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Given EC(x,y), x shares some boundary points with y. For NTPP(x,z) to be true, these boundary points of x (which are also boundary points of y) would need to be interior points of z. This seems plausible.

Example: x is a square, y is a square that touches x at a single edge, and z is a very large square that completely contains x, extends beyond x in all directions, and also overlaps with part of y.

So, I think NTPP(x,z) can be possible.

Based on my systematic analysis, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)

I believe I've now correctly evaluated all possible RCC-8 relations.

For EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If z overlaps with y in a region that doesn't include the boundary where x and y touch, then x and z will be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. If z overlaps with y and extends to include the boundary point(s) where x and y touch, then x and z will be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. If z overlaps with y and extends beyond the boundary where x and y touch into the interior of x, then x and z will partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. Z could completely contain x as a tangential proper part while also overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. Z could completely contain x as a non-tangential proper part while also overlapping with y.

The remaining relations (TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ) are not possible because:
- If z overlaps with y, it cannot be completely contained within x (ruling out TPPi and NTPPi)
- If z overlaps with y, it cannot be identical to x (ruling out EQ)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
