PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

We're given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that PO(x,y), and y is identical to z (because EQ(y,z)), then x must have the same relationship with z as it does with y.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

To verify this:
- If x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y))
- And y is identical to z (EQ(y,z))
- Then x must also partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))

So the answer is PO(x,z).

Let me double-check this by considering all RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - not possible because x overlaps with y, and y is identical to z
2. EC(x,z) - not possible because x has interior overlap with y, and y is identical to z
3. PO(x,z) - possible because x partially overlaps with y, and y is identical to z
4. TPP(x,z) - not possible because x is not a tangential proper part of y, and y is identical to z
5. NTPP(x,z) - not possible because x is not a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is identical to z
6. TPPi(x,z) - not possible because y is not a tangential proper part of x, and y is identical to z
7. NTPPi(x,z) - not possible because y is not a non-tangential proper part of x, and y is identical to z
8. EQ(x,z) - not possible because x is not identical to y, and y is identical to z

So my answer is confirmed: the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me rethink this to be thorough.

We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some spatial part, but neither is entirely contained in the other.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are exactly the same region.

Since y and z are exactly the same region (EQ(y,z)), any relationship that holds between x and y must hold between x and z as well.

PO(x,y) means x partially overlaps with y. Since z is identical to y, x must also partially overlap with z. 

Therefore, PO(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Let me verify this by checking the definitions of each RCC-8 relation:

- DC(x,z) would mean x and z are disconnected, but this contradicts PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z).
- EC(x,z) would mean x and z only touch at the boundary with no interior overlap, but PO(x,y) means x and y have interior overlap, and y is identical to z.
- PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap, which is consistent with PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z).
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, but PO(x,y) means x is not entirely contained in y, and y is identical to z.
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, but again, PO(x,y) contradicts this.
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, but if y is identical to z, this would mean y is a tangential proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y).
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which similarly contradicts PO(x,y) given that EQ(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical, but if y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), this would mean x and y are identical, which contradicts PO(x,y).

Therefore, PO(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

So the answer is PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationship between x and z is constrained by the given relations.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (exactly the same spatial region)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region, z must have exactly the same relationship with x that y has with x.

Since we know PO(x,y), and y is identical to z, then x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: PO(x,z)
