PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We have:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's consider each of the eight RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part
6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse
7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse
8. EQ(x,z) - equal

Let's use spatial reasoning to figure out which of these are possible given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

For each relation, I'll try to construct a scenario that satisfies the conditions PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

1. DC(x,z) - Can x and z be disconnected?
   Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles on the left, and y and z as two overlapping circles on the right, where the overlap between x and y is completely separate from the overlap between y and z. In this case, x and z can be disconnected.
   So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z) - Can x and z be externally connected?
   Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and y and z as two overlapping circles, where x and z just touch at a single point. This can happen if x and z both have "cut-outs" that meet at a point. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z) - Can x and z partially overlap?
   Imagine x, y, and z as three circles, each overlapping with the other two. In this case, x and z can partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   Imagine x as a small circle, y as a larger circle that contains part of x, and z as an even larger circle that contains all of x and part of y. If x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) holds. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Similar to the above, but now imagine z is so large that x doesn't touch its boundary. Then NTPP(x,z) holds. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   By a similar argument as for TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   By a similar argument as for NTPP(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z) - Can x and z be equal?
   Imagine x and z as the same circle, and y as a slightly larger circle that contains part of x=z. Then PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) both hold, and EQ(x,z) also holds. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

It looks like all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). Let me double-check a couple of the less obvious ones with more detailed reasoning.

For TPP(x,z):
PO(x,y) means x and y share a part, but neither is contained in the other.
PO(y,z) means y and z share a part, but neither is contained in the other.
TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., x is completely contained in z and touches its boundary).

Can these all be satisfied simultaneously? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine x as a small disc, z as a larger disc that completely contains x such that x touches the boundary of z. Now, we need to place y such that it partially overlaps with both x and z. We could place y as a disc that intersects with part of x and part of z outside of x. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

For NTPPi(x,z):
NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch its boundary).

Can this be satisfied along with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine x as a large disc, z as a smaller disc completely contained within x and not touching its boundary. Now, we need to place y such that it partially overlaps with both x and z. We could place y as a disc that intersects with part of z and part of x outside of z. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

I think I was correct in my initial assessment: all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

But wait, let me make sure that my understanding of the RCC-8 relations is correct and that my constructed examples are valid. Let me double-check each one carefully:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   For this to be possible given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need y to be partly in x and partly in z, with no overlap between x and z. This is indeed possible. Imagine y as a dumbbell shape, with one end overlapping with x and the other end overlapping with z, and the middle part not overlapping with either. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   For this to be possible, we need x and z to touch at a boundary but not share any interior points. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), this means y must overlap with parts of x and z that are away from the boundary where x and z touch. This is a bit tricky to visualize, but I think it's possible. Imagine x and z as two shapes that touch at a single point, and y as a shape that overlaps with parts of x and z away from where they touch. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is straightforward. Imagine x, y, and z as three circles that all partially overlap with each other. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be possible, x must be completely contained in z and touch its boundary. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need y to overlap with part of x and part of z outside of x. Imagine x as a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z, and y as a circle that overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP(x,z), but now x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Imagine x as a small circle completely inside a larger circle z, and y as a circle that overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is just the reverse of TPP(x,z), so it's also a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is just the reverse of NTPP(x,z), so it's also a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   For this to be possible, x and z must be the same region. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), since x=z, we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,x). This is possible if y partially overlaps with x=z. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So it looks like all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

But wait, let's be very precise here in our understanding of PO. 

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y overlap.
- x is not a subset of y.
- y is not a subset of x.

Given this, let's revisit each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and DC(x,z). Let's consider x and z as two discs that are far apart. For y, we can have a dumbbell shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z. This satisfies all three relations.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and EC(x,z). Let's consider x and z as two discs that touch at a point. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z away from where they touch. This satisfies all three relations.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and PO(x,z). Let's consider x, y, and z as three discs that all partially overlap with each other. This satisfies all three relations.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPP(x,z). Let's consider x as a small disc touching the boundary of a larger disc z. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x. This satisfies all three relations.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPP(x,z). Let's consider x as a small disc completely inside a larger disc z. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x. This satisfies all three relations.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPPi(x,z). Let's consider z as a small disc touching the boundary of a larger disc x. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of z and part of x outside of z. This satisfies all three relations.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z). Let's consider z as a small disc completely inside a larger disc x. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of z and part of x outside of z. This satisfies all three relations.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and EQ(x,z). Let's consider x and z as the same disc. For y, we can have a disc that partially overlaps with x=z. This satisfies all three relations. Actually, since x=z, PO(y,z) is the same as PO(y,x), which is the same as PO(x,y) (because PO is symmetric). So we really just need to ensure PO(x,y) and EQ(x,z), which is clearly possible.

So, I still maintain that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, wait, I think there might be a problem with my understanding of the RCC-8 relations. Let me be precise:

- DC(x,y): x and y have no points in common.
- EC(x,y): x and y have no interior points in common, but they have boundary points in common.
- PO(x,y): x and y have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y, and x has boundary points in common with y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y, and x has no boundary points in common with y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and y has boundary points in common with x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and y has no boundary points in common with x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same set.

Given these precise definitions, let's revisit each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z have no points in common.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and DC(x,z). Let's consider x and z as two discs that are far apart. For y, we can have a dumbbell shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z. This satisfies all three relations.

2. EC(x,z): x and z have no interior points in common, but they have boundary points in common.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and EC(x,z). Let's consider x and z as two discs that touch at a point. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z away from where they touch. This satisfies all three relations.

3. PO(x,z): x and z have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and PO(x,z). Let's consider x, y, and z as three discs that all partially overlap with each other. This satisfies all three relations.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and x has boundary points in common with z.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPP(x,z). Let's consider x as a small disc touching the boundary of a larger disc z. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x. This satisfies all three relations.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and x has no boundary points in common with z.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPP(x,z). Let's consider x as a small disc completely inside a larger disc z. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x. This satisfies all three relations.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and z has boundary points in common with x.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPPi(x,z). Let's consider z as a small disc touching the boundary of a larger disc x. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of z and part of x outside of z. This satisfies all three relations.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and z has no boundary points in common with x.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z). Let's consider z as a small disc completely inside a larger disc x. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of z and part of x outside of z. This satisfies all three relations.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same set.
   We need to construct a scenario where PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and EQ(x,z). Let's consider x and z as the same disc. For y, we can have a disc that partially overlaps with x=z. This satisfies all three relations.

So, I still maintain that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Hmm, actually, let me double-check a couple of the less obvious ones more carefully to make sure I'm not missing anything.

For DC(x,z):
PO(x,y) means x and y have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.
PO(y,z) means y and z have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.
DC(x,z) means x and z have no points in common.

Can these all be satisfied simultaneously? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine x and z as two discs that are far apart. For y, we can have a dumbbell shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

For EC(x,z):
EC(x,z) means x and z have no interior points in common, but they have boundary points in common.

Can this be satisfied along with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine x and z as two discs that touch at a point. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z away from where they touch. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

For TPP(x,z):
TPP(x,z) means x is a proper subset of z, and x has boundary points in common with z.

Can this be satisfied along with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine x as a small disc touching the boundary of a larger disc z. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

For NTPP(x,z):
NTPP(x,z) means x is a proper subset of z, and x has no boundary points in common with z.

Can this be satisfied along with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine x as a small disc completely inside a larger disc z. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

For TPPi(x,z):
TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper subset of x, and z has boundary points in common with x.

Can this be satisfied along with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine z as a small disc touching the boundary of a larger disc x. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of z and part of x outside of z. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPPi(x,z). So TPPi(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

For NTPPi(x,z):
NTPPi(x,z) means z is a proper subset of x, and z has no boundary points in common with x.

Can this be satisfied along with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine z as a small disc completely inside a larger disc x. For y, we can have a shape that overlaps with part of z and part of x outside of z. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

For EQ(x,z):
EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same set.

Can this be satisfied along with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Let's try to construct an example. Imagine x and z as the same disc. For y, we can have a disc that partially overlaps with x=z. This satisfies PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and EQ(x,z). So EQ(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

So, after careful consideration, I still maintain that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, wait. I think I was being a bit sloppy in some of my reasoning. Let me make sure I have the definitions right and am being precise in my examples.

RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they have no points in common).
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they have no interior points in common, but they have boundary points in common).
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other).
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is a proper subset of y, and x has boundary points in common with y).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is a proper subset of y, and x has no boundary points in common with y).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(y,x)).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(y,x)).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (they are the same set).

Now, for the problem at hand, we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), and we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   For this to be true, x and z must have no points in common. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need y to have parts in common with both x and z, but x and z should have no common parts. This is possible. Imagine y as a "bridge" between the disconnected regions x and z. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   For this to be true, x and z must have boundary points in common but no interior points in common. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need y to have interior points in common with both x and z, but x and z should only share boundary points. This is possible. Imagine x and z as two regions that touch at their boundaries, and y as a region that overlaps with both. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   For this to be true, x and z must have interior points in common, but neither should be a subset of the other. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), this is possible. Imagine x, y, and z as three regions where each pair shares some interior points. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x must be a proper subset of z and have boundary points in common with z. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need y to have interior points in common with both x and z, but x should be completely contained in z and touch its boundary. This is possible. Imagine x as a small region inside z, touching its boundary, and y as a region that overlaps with both. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x must be a proper subset of z and have no boundary points in common with z. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need y to have interior points in common with both x and z, but x should be completely contained inside z without touching its boundary. This is possible. Imagine x as a small region inside z, not touching its boundary, and y as a region that overlaps with both. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be a proper subset of x and have boundary points in common with x. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need y to have interior points in common with both x and z, but z should be completely contained in x and touch its boundary. This is possible. Imagine z as a small region inside x, touching its boundary, and y as a region that overlaps with both. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be a proper subset of x and have no boundary points in common with x. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need y to have interior points in common with both x and z, but z should be completely contained inside x without touching its boundary. This is possible. Imagine z as a small region inside x, not touching its boundary, and y as a region that overlaps with both. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   For this to be true, x and z must be the same set. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,x) (since x = z). This is possible as long as y partially overlaps with the region x=z. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, after careful analysis, I still maintain that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me try one more time, though, and make sure I'm not making a mistake, by focusing on the specific regions of intersection. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), there are several distinct regions to consider:

1. Region A: Points in x but not in y or z.
2. Region B: Points in y but not in x or z.
3. Region C: Points in z but not in x or y.
4. Region D: Points in x and y but not in z.
5. Region E: Points in y and z but not in x.
6. Region F: Points in x and z but not in y.
7. Region G: Points in x, y, and z.

For PO(x,y) to hold, regions A and D must be non-empty. Similarly, for PO(y,z) to hold, regions B and E must be non-empty.

Now, let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   For this to be true, regions F and G must be empty. This is consistent with the constraints above, so DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   For this to be true, region F must be empty, and x and z must share boundary points. This is consistent with the constraints above, so EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   For this to be true, regions A, C, and F must all be non-empty. This is consistent with the constraints above, so PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, region A must be empty, and region F must be non-empty. Moreover, x must touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with the constraints above, so TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, region A must be empty, and region F must be non-empty. Moreover, x must not touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with the constraints above, so NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, region C must be empty, and region F must be non-empty. Moreover, z must touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with the constraints above, so TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, region C must be empty, and region F must be non-empty. Moreover, z must not touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with the constraints above, so NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   For this to be true, regions A and C must be empty, and region F must be the same as the union of x and z. This is consistent with the constraints above, so EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, after this more detailed analysis, I still maintain that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually I think there is an issue with my last analysis. Let me fix that:

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), there are several distinct regions to consider:

1. Region A: Points in x but not in y or z.
2. Region B: Points in y but not in x or z.
3. Region C: Points in z but not in x or y.
4. Region D: Points in x and y but not in z.
5. Region E: Points in y and z but not in x.
6. Region F: Points in x and z but not in y.
7. Region G: Points in x, y, and z.

For PO(x,y) to hold, regions A and D must be non-empty, and regions B and D must be non-empty, which ensures that x and y have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.

Similarly, for PO(y,z) to hold, regions B and E must be non-empty, and regions C and E must be non-empty, which ensures that y and z have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.

Now, let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   For this to be true, regions F and G must be empty. This is consistent with the constraints above, so DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   For this to be true, regions F and G must be empty, and x and z must share boundary points. This is consistent with the constraints above, so EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   For this to be true, regions A, C, and F or G must all be non-empty. This is consistent with the constraints above, so PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, region A must be empty, and regions D or G must be non-empty. Moreover, x must touch the boundary of z. Actually, if A is empty, it means x is a subset of the union of y and z. For x to be a proper subset of z, we would need the union of regions D and G to be equal to x, which means there are no points in x that are not in z. But PO(x,y) requires region A to be non-empty. So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let's try again.

For TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, regions A and F must be empty, and region D or G must be non-empty. Moreover, x must touch the boundary of z. This would mean x is contained in z (because regions A and F are empty). But PO(x,y) requires regions A or D to be non-empty, and PO(y,z) requires regions B or E to be non-empty. These constraints can be satisfied simultaneously. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, wait, I think I'm getting confused again.

For TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, every point in x must be in z, and there must be points in z that are not in x. Moreover, x must touch the boundary of z. 

   In terms of our regions:
   - Every point in x must be in z, so regions A and D must be empty (since they are in x but not in z).
   - There must be points in z that are not in x, so regions C or E must be non-empty.
   - For x to be non-empty, regions F or G must be non-empty.

   But PO(x,y) requires regions A or D to be non-empty, which contradicts the requirement for TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

OK this is getting confusing, so let me take a more direct approach. I'll consider each of the eight RCC-8 relations and decide whether they are possible or not.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Let's construct a concrete example. Consider:
   - x is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 1.
   - z is the region defined by the disc with center at (3,0) and radius 1.
   - y is the region defined by the disc with center at (1.5,0) and radius 1.

   Clearly, x and z are disconnected (they are 1 unit apart). y overlaps with both x and z, but neither is fully contained in the other. So PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and DC(x,z) also holds. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   Let's construct a concrete example. Consider:
   - x is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 1.
   - z is the region defined by the disc with center at (2,0) and radius 1.
   - y is the region defined by the disc with center at (1,1) and radius 1.

   x and z touch at the point (1,0), so they are externally connected. y overlaps with both x and z, but neither is fully contained in the other. So PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and EC(x,z) also holds. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Let's construct a concrete example. Consider:
   - x is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 1.
   - z is the region defined by the disc with center at (1,0) and radius 1.
   - y is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,1) and radius 1.

   x and z overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other. y overlaps with both x and z, but neither is fully contained in the other. So PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and PO(x,z) all hold. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Let's try to construct a concrete example. For TPP(x,z) to hold, x must be a proper subset of z, touching its boundary. For PO(x,y) to hold, x and y must overlap, but neither can be a subset of the other. For PO(y,z) to hold, y and z must overlap, but neither can be a subset of the other.

   Consider:
   - z is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 2.
   - x is the region defined by the disc with center at (1,0) and radius 1.
   - y is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,2) and radius 1.5.

   x is entirely contained within z and touches its boundary at the point (2,0). y overlaps with z but is not contained within it. y also overlaps with x but is not contained within it. So PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPP(x,z) all hold. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, I think I need to think about this more carefully. In the last example, x is a proper subset of z, but for PO(x,y) to hold, y must overlap with x but neither is a subset of the other. Now, if some part of y is outside of z, then it can't also be in x, because x is fully contained in z. But that means that y can't have parts that are outside of both x and z. So this might not work.

Let me try again. For TPP(x,z) to hold, x must be a proper subset of z, touching its boundary. For PO(x,y) to hold, x and y must overlap, but neither can be a subset of the other. For PO(y,z) to hold, y and z must overlap, but neither can be a subset of the other.

Consider:
- z is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 2.
- x is the region defined by the disc with center at (1,0) and radius 1.
- y is a crescent-shaped region that overlaps with the left half of x and extends outside of z to the left.

With this setup, x is a tangential proper part of z. y overlaps with x but is not contained within it, and x is not contained within y. y also overlaps with z but is not contained within it, and z is not contained within y. So PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPP(x,z) all hold. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Let's try to construct a concrete example. For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x must be a proper subset of z, not touching its boundary. For PO(x,y) to hold, x and y must overlap, but neither can be a subset of the other. For PO(y,z) to hold, y and z must overlap, but neither can be a subset of the other.

   Consider:
   - z is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 3.
   - x is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 1.
   - y is a crescent-shaped region that overlaps with the left half of x and extends outside of z to the left.

   With this setup, x is a non-tangential proper part of z. y overlaps with x but is not contained within it, and x is not contained within y. y also overlaps with z but is not contained within it, and z is not contained within y. So PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPP(x,z) all hold. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

   Actually, I think my example doesn't work if y extends outside of z, because then y would contain parts that are in x but not in z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). Let me fix this.

   Consider:
   - z is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 3.
   - x is the region defined by the disc with center at (0,0) and radius 1.
   - y is a crescent-shaped region that overlaps with the left half of x and extends within z but outside of x.

   With this setup, x is a non-tangential proper part of z. y overlaps with x but is not contained within it, and x is not contained within y. y also overlaps with z but is not contained within it, and z is not contained within y. So PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPP(x,z) all hold. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

OK this is getting complicated, so let me see if I can draw out some examples. For each of the eight RCC-8 relations, I'll try to give a simple example that satisfies the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Example: x is on the left, z is on the right, and y is in the middle, overlapping with both x and z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   Example: x is on the left, z is on the right, they touch at a point, and y is positioned to overlap with both x and z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Example: x and z overlap, and y is positioned to overlap with both x and z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Actually, I'm not sure if this is possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then every point in x is also in z. For PO(x,y) to hold, there must be points in x that are not in y, and there must be points in y that are not in x. Similarly, for PO(y,z) to hold, there must be points in y that are not in z, and there must be points in z that are not in y. But if every point in x is also in z, then the points in y that are also in x must be in z. So the points in y can be:
   - In both x and z
   - In z but not in x
   - Not in x and not in z

   But for PO(x,y) to hold, there must be points in y that are in x. And those points must also be in z. So the points in y can be:
   - In both x and z
   - In z but not in x
   - Not in x and not in z

   And there must be points in y that are not in x. But for PO(y,z) to hold, there must be points in y that are not in z. But these points can't be in x (because all points in x are in z). So the points in y that are not in z are also not in x. But then y doesn't have any points that are in x but not in z, which means that if a point is in both x and y, it's also in z. And if a point is in y but not in z, it's not in x. This seems to describe the pattern of a TPP relation, not a PO relation.

   Let me try to be more concrete. If TPP(x,z), then x is a subset of z. If PO(x,y), then there are points in x that are not in y, and there are points in y that are not in x. If PO(y,z), then there are points in y that are not in z, and there are points in z that are not in y.

   Let's try with an example. Let x be the unit disc centered at (0, 0), and let z be the disc with radius 2 centered at (0, 0). Then TPP(x,z) holds. Now, we need to find a region y such that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold. For PO(x,y) to hold, y must have points in common with x, but neither can be a subset of the other. For PO(y,z) to hold, y must have points in common with z, but neither can be a subset of the other.

   Let's try defining y as the unit disc centered at (1, 0). Then y overlaps with x (they share the region around (0.5, 0)), but neither is a subset of the other. y also overlaps with z, but y is not a subset of z (because y extends beyond z at the point (2, 0)), and z is not a subset of y (because z includes points like (-1, 0) that are not in y). So PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) both hold.

   So it seems like TPP(x,z) is a possible relation, but that means that both TPP(x,z) and DC(x,z) are possible, which seems strange.

Actually, let me think about this in a different way.

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we know that:
- x and y have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.
- y and z have interior points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.

Now, I'll try to work out the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Can x and z be disconnected given the constraints? Yes, if y forms a "bridge" between the disconnected regions x and z. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   Can x and z be externally connected given the constraints? Yes, if y overlaps with both x and z, and x and z touch at a boundary. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Can x and z partially overlap given the constraints? Yes, if x, y, and z all partially overlap with each other. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x must be a proper subset of z, and x must touch the boundary of z. Given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), can TPP(x,z) hold? Let's consider:

   For PO(x,y) to hold, there must be points in x that are not in y, and there must be points in y that are not in x. Similarly, for PO(y,z) to hold, there must be points in y that are not in z, and there must be points in z that are not in y.

   If TPP(x,z) holds, then every point in x is also in z. So, if a point is in x but not in y, it's also in z. And if a point is in both x and y, it's also in z.

   But for PO(y,z) to hold, there must be points in y that are not in z. These points can't be in x (because all points in x are in z). So, the points in y that are not in z are also not in x.

   Can these constraints be satisfied simultaneously? Yes, if:
   - There are points in x that are not in y (satisfying part of PO(x,y)).
   - There are points in y that are in x (satisfying the other part of PO(x,y)).
   - There are points in y that are not in x and not in z (satisfying part of PO(y,z)).
   - There are points in z that are not in y (satisfying the other part of PO(y,z)).
   - All points in x are in z (satisfying TPP(x,z)).
   - x touches the boundary of z (satisfying the "tangential" part of TPP(x,z)).

   I believe these constraints can be satisfied simultaneously, so TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to the analysis for TPP(x,z), but now x doesn't touch the boundary of z. I believe NTPP(x,z) is also a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be a proper subset of x, and z must touch the boundary of x. Using a similar analysis as for TPP(x,z), but with the roles of x and z reversed, I believe TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to the analysis for TPPi(x,z), but now z doesn't touch the boundary of x. I believe NTPPi(x,z) is also a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   For this to be true, x and z must be the same set. Given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), can EQ(x,z) hold? If x = z, then PO(x,y) is the same as PO(z,y), which is the same as PO(y,z) (because PO is symmetric). So, the constraints reduce to just PO(x,y). This can be satisfied if y partially overlaps with the region x=z. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, after careful analysis, I believe all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me double-check a couple of the more intricate cases:

For TPP(x,z), my argument was:
If TPP(x,z) holds, then every point in x is also in z. So, if a point is in x but not in y, it's also in z. And if a point is in both x and y, it's also in z.

But for PO(y,z) to hold, there must be points in y that are not in z. These points can't be in x (because all points in x are in z). So, the points in y that are not in z are also not in x.

Let's try to draw this out. We'd have regions like:
- Points in x but not in y (and these are also in z).
- Points in y but not in x and not in z.
- Points in both x and y (and these are also in z).
- Points in z but not in x and not in y.

Is this a valid configuration? It seems to be. We have:
- PO(x,y) because there are points in x but not in y, and there are points in y but not in x.
- PO(y,z) because there are points in y but not in z, and there are points in z but not in y.
- TPP(x,z) because all points in x are in z, and x touches the boundary of z.

So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

For NTPP(x,z), the analysis is similar, but now x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is also a valid configuration, so NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

For TPPi(x,z), we need z to be a tangential proper part of x. Using a similar analysis, this is also a valid configuration, so TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

For NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. Using a similar analysis, this is also a valid configuration, so NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

For EQ(x,z), we need x and z to be the same set. If x = z, then PO(x,y) is the same as PO(z,y), which is the same as PO(y,z) (because PO is symmetric). So, the constraints reduce to just PO(x,y). This can be satisfied if y partially overlaps with the region x=z. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, after careful analysis, I still maintain that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

That is, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations can possibly hold between x and z when we know that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze what these conditions tell us:
- PO(x,y) means x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other
- PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other

Let me consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine y as a "bridge" shape that partially overlaps with x on one side and partially overlaps with z on the other, while x and z remain disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries while y overlaps with portions of both x and z away from where they touch.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. All three regions can partially overlap with each other.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be a proper part of z touching z's boundary, while y overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be completely inside z without touching its boundary, while y overlaps with part of x and part of z outside of x.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be a proper part of x touching x's boundary, while y overlaps with part of z and part of x outside of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely inside x without touching its boundary, while y overlaps with part of z and part of x outside of z.

8. EQ(x,z): This is possible. If x and z are the same region, y can still partially overlap with this region.
