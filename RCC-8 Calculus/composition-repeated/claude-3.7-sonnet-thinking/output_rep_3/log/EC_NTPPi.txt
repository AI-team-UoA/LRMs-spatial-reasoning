PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's understand the given information:
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Let's visualize this. 
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z, and y does not touch z's boundary. In other words, y is strictly inside z.

Given this, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

1. First, let's check if x and z can be disconnected (DC).
   If x only touches y at the boundary, and y is strictly inside z, then x might not touch z at all.
   But wait, if y is strictly inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then x must at least touch z's interior.
   So, x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. Can x and z touch externally (EC)?
   For this to happen, x would need to touch z only at z's boundary. But we know that x touches y's boundary, and y is strictly inside z. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x must touch z's interior.
   So, x and z cannot be in the EC relation.

3. Can x partially overlap with z (PO)?
   Yes, this seems possible. If x touches y at y's boundary and has a significant part outside y, but also has a part that goes into y, and since y is strictly inside z, x can partially overlap with z.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)?
   This is possible if x touches the boundary of y and is completely within z, but also touches z's boundary.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)?
   This is possible if x is completely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)?
   For this to happen, z would have to be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. But we know that y is strictly inside z, and x touches y's boundary. This means that z contains y, which touches x. It's not clear if z can be a proper part of x given these constraints.
   Actually, I think this is not possible. If z contains y, and y touches x from the inside, then z cannot be inside x.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)?
   Similar to the above, if z contains y, and y touches x, then z cannot be strictly inside x.

8. Can x and z be equal (EQ)?
   This doesn't seem possible given the constraints. If x and y touch at their boundaries, and y is strictly inside z, then x cannot be equal to z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z seem to be:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But let's verify these more carefully.

For PO(x,z):
If x and y touch at their boundaries and x has a part outside y, and y is strictly inside z, then x can have a part inside z (through y) and a part outside z. This is the definition of PO.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z and also touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary (which is inside z), then x is a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary (which is inside z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

I think these three relations are possible, but let me check again with a clearer visualization.

Let's try to draw this in ASCII:

For PO(x,z):
```
        +------------------+
        |         z        |
        |   +--------+     |
        |   |    y   |     |
        |   |        |     |
        |   +--------+     |
+-------|---+              |
|       |   |              |
|   x   |   |              |
|       |   |              |
+-------|---+              |
        |                  |
        +------------------+
```

Here, x and y touch at their boundaries, y is strictly inside z, and x partially overlaps with z.

For TPP(x,z):
```
        +------------------+
        |         z        |
        |   +--------+     |
        |   |    y   |     |
        |   |        |     |
        |   +--------+     |
        |  /         \     |
        | +           +    |
        | |     x     |    |
        | +           +    |
        |  \         /     |
        |   +---------+    |
        |                  |
        +------------------+
```

Here, x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
```
        +------------------+
        |         z        |
        |   +--------+     |
        |   |    y   |     |
        |   |        |     |
        |   +--------+     |
        |   /        \     |
        |  +          +    |
        |  |     x    |    |
        |  +          +    |
        |   \        /     |
        |                  |
        |                  |
        +------------------+
```

Here, x is strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary.

Actually, I need to revise my thinking. I misunderstood the EC relation slightly. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch only at their boundaries and do not share any interior points. So, if we say EC(x,y), it means x is completely outside y except for the boundary they share.

With this understanding, let's revise the possible relations between x and z.

1. DC(x,z):
   If x is completely outside y except for the boundary they share, and y is strictly inside z, then x might still be disconnected from z. But wait, if x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x must at least touch z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   For this to happen, x would need to touch z only at z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary, and y is strictly inside z, then x would touch z's interior, not just its boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   If x touches y at y's boundary and is mostly outside y, and y is strictly inside z, then x can have a small part inside z (through the connection with y) and most of its part outside z. This fits the definition of PO.

4. TPP(x,z):
   If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary (which is inside z), then x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary (which is inside z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):
   As I argued before, these don't seem possible because if z contains y, and y touches x from the inside, then z cannot be inside x.

7. EQ(x,z):
   This is not possible for the reasons I mentioned earlier.

Actually, I made an error in my reasoning. I'm trying to deduce the spatial relationship between x and z based on the facts EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which means NTPP(z,y), or z is properly inside y without touching y's boundary).

OK, let me revise. 
* EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries, but they don't overlap. 
* NTPPi(y,z) means y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

In ASCII:
```
 x                y
+--+            +-----+
|  |            |     |
|  +------------+     |
|               |  z  |
|               | +-+ |
|               | | | |
+---------------+ +-+ |
                |     |
                +-----+
```

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
   If x only touches y at the boundary, and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, then x and z don't share any points. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   For x and z to touch at their boundaries, z would need to extend to y's boundary where x touches it. But we're told that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share some interior points. But since x only touches y at y's boundary, and z is strictly inside y, they don't share any interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):
   For x to be a proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z. But we know that x is mostly outside y, and z is inside y. So, these are not possible.

5. TPPi(x,z):
   For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But we know that z is inside y, and x only touches y at its boundary. So, z cannot be inside x. TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. NTPPi(x,z):
   For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be strictly inside x. Again, this is not possible based on the given constraints.

7. EQ(x,z):
   For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the same space. But we know that x is mostly outside y, and z is inside y. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on the constraints, it seems that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, I need to revise again. NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z without touching z's boundary. Let me redo.

* EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
* NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z without touching z's boundary, or equivalently, z properly contains y without touching y's boundary.

In ASCII:
```
         z
+-------------------+
|                   |
|     +-------+     |
|     |   y   |     |
|     |       |     |
|     +-------+     |
|     /             |
|   x+              |
|     \             |
|                   |
+-------------------+
```

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
   For x and z to be disconnected, they would need to not share any points. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x would also touch z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   For x and z to touch at their boundaries, x would need to touch z only at z's boundary. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x would touch z at a point inside z, not at z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   For x and z to partially overlap, x would need to have some parts inside z and some parts outside z. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x would have a small part inside z (the part that touches y) and the rest outside z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z):
   For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be inside z and touch z's boundary. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x would not be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be strictly inside z. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x would not be entirely inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But z contains y, and y touches x at y's boundary. So, z cannot be inside x. TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be strictly inside x. Again, this is not possible based on the given constraints.

8. EQ(x,z):
   For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the same space. But we know that x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on the constraints, it seems that the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Hmm, I think I need to revise again. There's something wrong with my reasoning.

Alright, let me start again with a clearer understanding.

* EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points.
* NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary. Equivalently, z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

In ASCII:
```
      y
+---------------+
|               |
|      z        |
|   +-----+     |
|   |     |     |
|   |     |     |
|   +-----+     |
|           x   |
|        +---+  |
+--------|---+  |
         |      |
         +------+
```

But wait, this isn't right. Let me redo:

* EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points.
* NTPPi(y,z): NTPPi is the inverse of NTPP. So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). NTPP means that the first argument is a non-tangential proper part of the second. So, NTPP(z,y) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, I have:

* EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points.
* NTPPi(y,z): z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let me draw a correct ASCII diagram:

```
             y
    +-------------------+
    |                   |
    |      z            |
    |   +-----+         |
    |   |     |         |
    |   |     |         |
    |   +-----+         |
x   |                   |
+---|---+               |
|   |   |               |
|   +---+               |
|                       |
+-----------------------+
```

In this diagram, x and y touch at their boundaries (EC), and z is entirely inside y without touching y's boundary (NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y)).

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
   If x only touches y at y's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, then x and z don't share any points. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   For x and z to touch at their boundaries, z would need to extend to y's boundary where x touches it. But we're told that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share some interior points. But since x only touches y at y's boundary, and z is strictly inside y without touching y's boundary, they don't share any interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):
   For x to be a proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z. But we know that x is mostly outside y, and z is inside y. So, these are not possible.

5. TPPi(x,z):
   For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But we know that z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and x only touches y at its boundary. So, z cannot touch x's boundary. TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. NTPPi(x,z):
   For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be strictly inside x. Again, this is not possible based on the given constraints.

7. EQ(x,z):
   For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the same space. But we know that x is mostly outside y, and z is inside y. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Given the constraints, the only possible relationship between x and z seems to be DC(x,z).

But wait, I need to consider more scenarios. The diagram I drew is one possible scenario. Let's consider another where x extends more into y.

Actually, let's think a bit differently. I want to reason more generally.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior points. NTPPi(y,z) means that y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these, what are the possibilities for the relationship between x and z?

1. DC(x,z):
   If x touches y only at y's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, then there's a separation between x and z. Thus, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   For x and z to touch at their boundaries, they would need to share a boundary point. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x and z cannot share a boundary point. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I'll approach this more methodically.

Given:
* EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points.
* NTPPi(y,z): z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Using the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x touches y only at y's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, then x and z don't share any points. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch only at their boundaries.
   For this to be true, x and z would need to share a boundary point. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x and z cannot share a boundary point. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   For this to be true, x and z would need to share some interior points, but neither should be contained in the other. But since x only touches y at y's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, x and z don't share any interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. But since x touches y at y's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, x cannot be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. But since x touches y at y's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, x cannot be entirely inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z would need to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z would need to be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. But since z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, z cannot be entirely inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   For this to be true, x and z would need to occupy the same space. But since x touches y at y's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, they cannot occupy the same space. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Given the constraints, the only possible relationship between x and z seems to be DC(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the constraints again. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior points. So, x and y share a boundary point but no interior points.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Wait, I messed up the interpretation again. Let's redo.

* EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points.
* NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary. In other words, z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Alright, now let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
   If x only touches y at y's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, then x and z don't share any points. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   For x and z to touch at their boundaries, z would need to extend to y's boundary where x touches it. But we're told that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share some interior points. But since x only touches y at y's boundary, and z is strictly inside y without touching y's boundary, they don't share any interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):
   For x to be a proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z. But we know that x is mostly outside y, and z is inside y. So, these are not possible.

5. TPPi(x,z):
   For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But we know that z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and x only touches y at its boundary. So, z cannot touch x's boundary. TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. NTPPi(x,z):
   For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be strictly inside x. Again, this is not possible based on the given constraints.

7. EQ(x,z):
   For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the same space. But we know that x is mostly outside y, and z is inside y. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on the constraints, it seems that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

But wait, I think I need to be careful about the interpretation of NTPPi.

NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which is the inverse of NTPP. NTPP(z,y) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, if EC(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), then x touches y only at their boundary, and z is entirely inside y without touching y's boundary. Given these, x and z don't share any points, leading to the relationship DC(x,z).

Hmm, I think I made an error in interpreting the question. Let's read it again.

Given: EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

This means:
* EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points.
* NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

In ASCII:
```
         z
+-------------------+
|                   |
|     +-------+     |
|     |   y   |     |
|     |       |     |
|     +-------+     |
|     /             |
|   x+              |
|     \             |
|                   |
+-------------------+
```

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
   For x and z to be disconnected, they would need to not share any points. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x would also touch z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   For x and z to touch at their boundaries, x would need to touch z only at z's boundary. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x would touch z at a point inside z, not at z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   For x and z to partially overlap, x would need to have some parts inside z and some parts outside z. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x would have a small part inside z (the part that touches y) and the rest outside z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

Actually, it seems I can construct an example where x is a tangential proper part of z.

```
         z

In this diagram, x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. It also touches y at y's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

I can even construct an example where x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

In this diagram, x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. It touches y at y's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me be more careful here. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points. This means x is outside y, but they touch at a point on their boundaries.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given these constraints, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x would have to enter z to touch y. This means x and z must share some points. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

If x is entirely inside z, then it can be a tangential proper part (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part (NTPP) based on whether it touches z's boundary.

If x has some parts inside z and some parts outside z, then x and z partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

If z is inside x, then z would have to be a tangential proper part (TPPi) or a non-tangential proper part (NTPPi) based on whether it touches x's boundary. But since z contains y, and y touches x, z cannot be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

If x and z are equal, then they would occupy the same space. But since y is inside z, and x touches y at y's boundary, x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let's consider EC(x,z). For x and z to touch only at their boundaries, x would need to touch z only at z's boundary. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x would touch z at a point inside z, not just at z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me see if I got it right this time.

Actually, let's reconsider the constraints. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points. NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

If we say that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y's boundary does not touch z's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary, and y's boundary is inside z's boundary, x must enter z at some point. This means x and z share some points, so DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) would require that x and z touch only at their boundaries, sharing no interior points. But since x touches y's boundary, and y's boundary is inside z's boundary, x touches z at a point inside z's boundary, not just at z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z) would require that x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. If x touches y's boundary and extends outside z, then x and z partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z) would require that x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. If x is entirely inside z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z) would require that x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is entirely inside z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) would require that z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. But since z contains y, and y touches x's boundary, z cannot be entirely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) would require that z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, since z contains y, and y touches x's boundary, z cannot be entirely inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would require that x and z occupy the same space. But since y is inside z, and x touches y's boundary, x and z cannot occupy the same space. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This is the same answer I came up with earlier.

Actually, wait a minute. In my earlier reasoning, I made an error in interpreting the "touch" in EC(x,y). Two regions "touch" if they share a boundary point. It doesn't mean that one region has to enter the other.

Let me rethink this.

EC(x,y) means that x and y share a boundary point but no interior points. NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, if x and y share a boundary point but no interior points, and y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

If x is entirely outside z, then x and z can be disconnected (DC). But, if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x and z must share a point, making DC(x,z) not possible.

If x and z share only a boundary point, then they are in the EC relation. But, if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then the point where x touches y is inside z. So, x touches z at a point inside z, not just at z's boundary. Hence, EC(x,z) is not possible.

If x has some parts inside z and some parts outside z, then x and z partially overlap (PO). If x touches y at y's boundary and extends outside z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is possible. This can happen if x touches y at y's boundary and also extends to touch z's boundary.

If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible. This can happen if x touches y at y's boundary but doesn't extend to touch z's boundary.

If z is entirely inside x, then z would be a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi). But since z contains y, and y touches x, z cannot be entirely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

If x and z occupy the same space, then they are equal (EQ). But since y is inside z, and x touches y at y's boundary, x and z cannot occupy the same space. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I believe this is the correct answer.

Actually, I think PO is the only possible relation. Let me double-check.

EC(x,y) means that x and y share a boundary point but no interior points. NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x would not touch z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I'm not being careful enough. If x touches y's boundary, it doesn't mean that x is touching y at every point of y's boundary. It just means that there exists at least one point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary.

So, if x touches y at one point on y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could potentially be entirely inside z. If x also touches z's boundary at some other point, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, if x touches y at one point on y's boundary, is entirely inside z, but doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I've cycled back to the same answer, and I'm now confident that this is correct.

OK, the answer is PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) meaning that there are 3 possible relationships.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), I'll analyze how these conditions constrain their relationship.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch only at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given these constraints:

1. DC(x,z) is not possible: Since x touches y's boundary and y is inside z, x must share at least one point with z.

2. EC(x,z) is not possible: Since x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x must touch z at points inside z's boundary, not just at z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) is possible: x can have some parts inside z (where it touches y) and some parts outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) is possible: x can be completely inside z while touching z's boundary at some point, while also touching y's boundary at another point.

5. NTPP(x,z) is possible: x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) is not possible: Since z contains y and y touches x, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) is not possible: For the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z) is not possible: Since y is properly inside z, and x touches y's boundary, x and z cannot occupy the same space.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
