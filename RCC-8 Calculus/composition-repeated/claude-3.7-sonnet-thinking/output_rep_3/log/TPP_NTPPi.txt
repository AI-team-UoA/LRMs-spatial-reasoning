PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what possible relationships can hold between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let's first understand the given relations:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is part of y and x touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z share no spatial parts. But since both x and z are parts of y, they must be in the same spatial region (y). However, they might not overlap at all within y. So, this is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. Since z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while x does touch y's boundary, it's possible that x and z touch at their boundaries inside y. So, this is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: This means x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. Since both x and z are parts of y, it's possible that they partially overlap within y. So, this is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Since z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while x does touch y's boundary, x can't be entirely inside z. So, this is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part: This means x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, since x touches y's boundary and z is entirely inside y without touching y's boundary, x can't be entirely inside z. So, this is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Since z is entirely inside y without touching y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible that z is entirely inside x and touches x's inner boundary. So, this is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, it's possible that z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. So, this is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are the same. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, they can't be the same. So, this is not a possibility.

So, based on the constraints given by TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected
EC(x,z) - Externally Connected
PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping
TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse
NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse

Let me verify this once more.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident in my analysis. Let me rethink this carefully.

TPP(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Wait, I think I misunderstood the NTPPi relation. Let me revisit the definitions:

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which implies z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

But I think I got confused by the order. NTPPi(y,z) actually means NTPP(z,y), which means z is inside y without touching y's boundary.

So the correct understanding is:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z contains y, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

So we have y inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is inside y (touching y's boundary).

Let's rethink the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z share no spatial parts. Since y is inside z and x is inside y, x must also be inside z. So, x and z can't be disconnected. This is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. Since y is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x is inside y, x can't touch z's boundary. So, x and z can't be externally connected. This is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: This means x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. Since y is inside z and x is inside y, x must be entirely inside z. So, x and z can't be partially overlapping. This is not a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x is inside y, x can't touch z's boundary. So, x and z can't be in a TPP relationship. This is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part: This means x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x is inside y, x is inside z without touching z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Since y is inside z and x is inside y, z can't be part of x. This is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, since y is inside z and x is inside y, z can't be part of x. This is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are the same. Since y is inside z and x is inside y, x and z can't be the same. This is not a possibility.

So, based on this revised understanding, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I'm still not confident. Let me double-check the definitions once more.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is not a tangential proper part of z. It's the inverse of NTPP.

NTPP(a,b) means that a is a non-tangential proper part of b. This means a is inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which implies z is inside y without touching y's boundary.

So, the correct understanding is:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is part of y without touching y's boundary.

So, both x and z are inside y, with x touching y's boundary and z not touching y's boundary.

Let's rethink the possible relationships between x and z once more:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z share no spatial parts. Since both x and z are inside y, they might not overlap at all within y. So, this is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. Since both x and z are inside y, it's possible that they touch at their boundaries. So, this is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: This means x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. Since both x and z are inside y, it's possible that they partially overlap. So, this is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. It's possible that x is inside z and touches z's boundary. So, this is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part: This means x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. It's possible that x is inside z without touching z's boundary. So, this is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Since z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's not possible for z to be entirely inside x if x touches y's boundary (because z would then also touch y's boundary through x). So, this is not a possibility.

Actually wait let me rethink this. If z is part of x, and x touches y's boundary, does that necessarily mean z touches y's boundary? Not necessarily. z could be inside x in such a way that it doesn't touch x's outer boundary (which touches y's boundary). So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, it's possible that z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. So, this is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are the same. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, they can't be the same. So, this is not a possibility.

So, based on this revised understanding, the possible relationships between x and z are:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected
EC(x,z) - Externally Connected
PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping
TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part
NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part
TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse
NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse

Actually, I think I need to rethink TPPi(x,z) further. If z is part of x, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, then x, which contains z, must also be inside y. But the given condition is TPP(x,y), which means x touches y's boundary. So, there's a contradiction. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) means z is part of x without touching x's boundary. But if z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and x is inside y touching y's boundary, the same contradiction arises. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected
EC(x,z) - Externally Connected
PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping
TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part
NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part

Wait, I'm making an error in understanding these relations.

Let's clarify the definitions once more:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which implies z is inside y without touching y's boundary.

So, the scenario is:
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- z is inside y without touching y's boundary.

OK, I think I need to also fix my confusions with TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which implies z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which implies z is inside x without touching x's boundary.

Now, let's reanalyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z share no spatial parts. Since both x and z are inside y, they might not overlap at all within y. So, this is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. Since both x and z are inside y, it's possible that they touch at their boundaries. So, this is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: This means x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. Since both x and z are inside y, it's possible that they partially overlap. So, this is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since z is inside y without touching y's boundary, if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, x would still be inside y without touching y's boundary. But the given condition is TPP(x,y), which means x touches y's boundary. So, there's a contradiction. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Wait, that's not necessarily true. x could touch both y's boundary and z's boundary if z is in the position shown below:
z
|         |
|         |
|  x      |
|    \    |
|     \   |
|      \  |
y-----------------
In this case, the right part of x touches both y's and z's boundaries. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

OK, so if TPP(x,z), then x touches z's boundary. And since TPP(x,y), x also touches y's boundary. But z is inside y without touching y's boundary (NTPPi(y,z)). If x is inside z and x touches y's boundary, then it means z also touches y's boundary through x. This contradicts the condition that z is inside y without touching y's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me clarify this with a diagram. For TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary. For NTPPi(y,z), z is inside y without touching y's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then it means z extends to y's boundary through x, which contradicts the condition that z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let's simplify:
- If x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then z must also extend to y's boundary.
- But z doesn't touch y's boundary.
Therefore, x can't be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part: This means x is inside z without touching z's boundary. Similar to TPP, if x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary through x. This contradicts the condition that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z is inside y without touching y's boundary, it's possible that z is inside x and touches x's boundary (not the part of x's boundary that touches y's boundary). So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is inside x without touching x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, it's possible that z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are the same. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, they can't be the same. So, this is not a possibility.

So, based on this revised understanding, the possible relationships between x and z are:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected
EC(x,z) - Externally Connected
PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping
TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse
NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse

Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting these correctly (I think my earlier issues had to do with getting confused between when we have TPP(x,y) vs. TPPi(x,y)).

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y. (Like a quarter coin inside but touching the edge of a dollar coin.)

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, and x does not touch the boundary of y. (like a dime coin inside a larger coin, but not touching the edge)

TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.

Given:
TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

So:
- x is inside y, touching y's boundary.
- z is inside y, not touching y's boundary.

The question is: what is the relationship between x and z?

Let's work through the possibilities again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means they don't share any points. Given that both x and z are inside y, this is possible if they don't overlap. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means they touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. Given that both x and z are inside y, this is possible if they touch at their boundaries. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share some points, but neither is a proper part of the other. Given that both x and z are inside y, this is possible if they partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of z. Now, x also touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)). If x is a proper part of z, then x doesn't extend beyond z. And if x touches the boundary of y, then z must also extend to the boundary of y at the point where x touches y. But from NTPPi(y,z), we know that z doesn't touch the boundary of y. This is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Similar to the TPP case, x touches the boundary of y. If x is inside z, then z must also extend to the boundary of y at the point where x touches y. But from NTPPi(y,z), z doesn't touch the boundary of y. This is a contradiction. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of x. Given that z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and x is inside y touching y's boundary, it's possible that z is inside x and touches the part of x's boundary that doesn't touch y's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Similar to TPPi, it's possible that z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, they can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected
EC(x,z) - Externally Connected
PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping
TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse
NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse

Let me recheck this one more time, using the given definitions:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which implies z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y without touching y's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Given that both x and z are inside y, this is possible if they don't overlap. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. Given that both x and z are inside y, this is possible if they touch at their boundaries. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Given that both x and z are inside y, this is possible if they partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But x also touches y's boundary. If x is inside z and touches y's boundary, then z must also extend to y's boundary at that point. But from NTPPi(y,z), z doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is inside z without touching z's boundary. But x touches y's boundary, and if x is inside z, then z must also extend to y's boundary at that point. But from NTPPi(y,z), z doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is inside x and touches x's boundary. From NTPPi(y,z), z is inside y without touching y's boundary. So, if z is inside x and x touches y's boundary, it's possible for z to be inside x and touch a part of x's boundary that doesn't touch y's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is inside x without touching x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, it's possible for z to be inside x without touching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, they can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected
EC(x,z) - Externally Connected
PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping
TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse
NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse

Let me double-check this with some diagrams to make sure I haven't missed anything. I should confirm that each of these relationships is possible given the constraints.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   y
   |         |
   |  x      |
   |         |
   |      z  |
   |         |
   -----------
   Here, x and z are both inside y, but they don't overlap. This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   y
   |         |
   |  x--z   |
   |         |
   |         |
   |         |
   -----------
   Here, x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   y
   |         |
   |  x-\    |
   |  | |    |
   |  \-z    |
   |         |
   -----------
   Here, x and z share some points, but neither is a proper part of the other. This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   y
   |         |
   |  x---   |
   |  |z|    |
   |  ---    |
   |         |
   -----------
   Here, z is inside x and touches x's boundary, but not the part of x's boundary that touches y's boundary. This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   y
   |         |
   |  x---   |
   |  | z|   |
   |  ---    |
   |         |
   -----------
   Here, z is inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

These diagrams confirm that the relationships DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are all possible given the constraints TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Therefore, the final answer is: the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

ANSWER:

I'll analyze the possible relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let's clarify what we know:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary)

So, both x and z are inside y, with x touching y's boundary and z not touching y's boundary.

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be completely disconnected while both being inside y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries while both being inside y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap while both being inside y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, and x touches y's boundary, then z would also have to touch y's boundary (at the same point), contradicting NTPPi(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x, touching x's internal boundary while not touching y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x, completely contained within x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because x touches y's boundary while z does not.
