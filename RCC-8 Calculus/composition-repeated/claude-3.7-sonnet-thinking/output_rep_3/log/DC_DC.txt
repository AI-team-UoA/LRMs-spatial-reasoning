PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through the possible relationships between x and z when we know that DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let me remind myself what DC(x,y) means: x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. Similarly, DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Now, when x and y are disconnected, and y and z are disconnected, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Actually, all of the RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z in this case. Let me demonstrate why:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected from each other, just as they are both disconnected from y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected, touching at their boundaries but not sharing interior parts.
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but not completely containing each other.
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal, occupying exactly the same space.

Let me verify each of these with a simple example to make sure they're all possible when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's say regions are in a 2D space:

For DC(x,z): 
- x is in the lower left corner
- y is in the upper right corner
- z is in the lower right corner
This way, x and y are disconnected, y and z are disconnected, and x and z are also disconnected.

For EC(x,z):
- x is in the left half
- y is in the upper right corner
- z is in the right half, touching x at the boundary
This way, x and y are disconnected, y and z are disconnected, but x and z share a boundary.

For PO(x,z):
- x is in the left half, extending a bit into the right half
- y is in the upper right corner, away from both x and z
- z is in the right half, overlapping with a portion of x
This way, x and y are disconnected, y and z are disconnected, but x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z):
- x is a small region in the lower half
- y is in the upper right corner
- z is the entire lower half, containing x entirely with x touching z's boundary
This way, x and y are disconnected, y and z are disconnected, and x is a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z):
- x is a small region in the center
- y is in the upper right corner
- z is a larger region that completely contains x, with some space between x and z's boundary
This way, x and y are disconnected, y and z are disconnected, and x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

For TPPi(x,z):
- x is the entire lower half
- y is in the upper right corner
- z is a small region in the lower half, touching x's boundary
This way, x and y are disconnected, y and z are disconnected, and z is a tangential proper part of x.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- x is a large region covering most of the space
- y is a small isolated region
- z is a small region completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
This way, x and y are disconnected, y and z are disconnected, and z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

For EQ(x,z):
- x and z are the same region in the lower half
- y is in the upper right corner
This way, x and y are disconnected, y and z are disconnected, and x is equal to z.

So, indeed, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Actually, let me double-check the case of EQ(x,z). If x and z are the same region, and DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), then we're saying that DC(x,y) and DC(x,y) because z is the same as x. This is consistent.

Actually, wait, let me re-examine all of these cases more carefully. The critical insight is that knowing DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) puts constraints on where y is, but doesn't necessarily constrain the relationship between x and z directly.

Let's verify each relation again, being more precise:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are in separate areas, and y is also separate from both. This is clearly possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. y is separate from both. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. y is separate from both x and z. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. y is separate from both x and z. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary. y is separate from both x and z. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. y is separate from both x and z. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary. y is separate from both x and z. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. y is separate from this region. This is possible.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are indeed possible between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z). This makes sense because knowing that x and y are disconnected, and y and z are disconnected, doesn't give us enough information to narrow down the relationship between x and z.

So the answer is: All relations from the RCC-8 calculus are possible between x and z given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z): DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

When x and y are disconnected, and y and z are disconnected, there's no direct constraint on how x and z must relate to each other. Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely separate regions, with y located elsewhere.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could touch at their boundaries while both remain disconnected from y.
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap while both remain separate from y.
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z, with y disconnected from both.
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, with y disconnected from both.
6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x, with y disconnected from both.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, with y disconnected from both.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be identical, with y disconnected from both.

I can find spatial configurations satisfying DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) for all eight possible relations between x and z.
