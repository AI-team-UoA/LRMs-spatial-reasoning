PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We are asked to figure out the possible relationships between regions x and z, given that:
1. DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected.
2. TPP(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's think about this systematically.

Given DC(x, y), we know that x and y have no spatial overlap whatsoever. They are completely separate regions.

Given TPP(y, z), we know that y is completely contained within z, but y touches the boundary of z. 

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   Yes, it's possible. If x is completely separate from both y and z, then x would be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x, z): Is it possible that x and z are externally connected (i.e., they touch at a boundary but don't overlap)?
   Yes, it's possible. Since y is a tangential proper part of z, y touches the boundary of z. It's possible that x, while disconnected from y, might touch the boundary of z at a point where y does not.

3. PO(x, z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   Yes, it's possible. x could be disconnected from y but still overlap with other parts of z.

4. TPP(x, z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, it's possible. x could be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary, while still being disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x, z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, it's possible. x could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and still be disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x, z) (which is the same as TPP(z, x)): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   No, this is not possible. Given TPP(y, z), y is part of z. Since DC(x, y), x and y are disconnected. If z were part of x, then y would also be part of x (by transitivity of the "part of" relation), which would contradict DC(x, y).

7. NTPPi(x, z) (which is the same as NTPP(z, x)): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   No, this is not possible, for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x, z): Is it possible that x and z are coincident?
   No, this is not possible. If x and z are the same region, then y would be part of x (since y is part of z), which would contradict DC(x, y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Hmm, let me review what I said above more carefully, because I want to be sure about the answer.

We know that DC(x, y) means that x and y are disconnected, meaning they share no points.
We know that TPP(y, z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Can x and z be disconnected?
   Yes, it's possible. For example, imagine a scenario where z is a large region, y is a small region touching the boundary of z, and x is completely outside of z.

2. EC(x, z): Can x and z be externally connected?
   Yes, it's possible. For example, imagine a scenario where z is a large region, y is a small region touching the boundary of z at one point, and x is outside of z but touches the boundary of z at a different point.

3. PO(x, z): Can x and z partially overlap?
   Yes, it's possible. For example, imagine a scenario where z is a large region, y is a small region touching the boundary of z, and x overlaps with part of z but is completely outside of y.

4. TPP(x, z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   No, wait, I need to reconsider this. If x is a part of z, then x is a subset of z. Given TPP(y, z), y is also a subset of z. If both x and y are subsets of z, they could potentially overlap within z, which would contradict DC(x, y). 

Wait, that's not correct. If x is a part of z and y is a part of z, it doesn't necessarily mean that x and y overlap. They could be disjoint parts of z.

So, TPP(x, z) is indeed possible. For example, imagine a scenario where z is a large region, y is a small region touching the boundary of z, and x is another small region within z that touches the boundary of z but is completely separate from y.

5. NTPP(x, z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, it's possible. For example, imagine a scenario where z is a large region, y is a small region touching the boundary of z, and x is another small region completely contained within z (not touching the boundary of z) and completely separate from y.

6. TPPi(x, z) (which is TPP(z, x)): Can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   No, this is not possible. Given TPP(y, z), y is a part of z. If z were a part of x, then by transitivity, y would be a part of x. But this contradicts DC(x, y), which says that x and y are disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x, z) (which is NTPP(z, x)): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   No, this is not possible, for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x, z): Can x and z be the same region?
   No, this is not possible. If x and z were the same, then since y is a part of z, y would also be a part of x. But this contradicts DC(x, y), which says that x and y are disconnected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, let me check each of these more carefully, with diagrams in mind. I will write out x, y, and z as regions, to check if each of the 8 relations is possible for x and z.

1. DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected.
   Let me check if this is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, that means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z. If x is disconnected from y, x could be completely outside of z. So yes, DC(x, z) is possible.

2. EC(x, z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary).
   Let me check if this is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, that means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z. If x is disconnected from y, x could be outside of z but touching the boundary of z at a point where y does not touch. So yes, EC(x, z) is possible.

3. PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap.
   Let me check if this is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, that means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z. If x is disconnected from y, x could partially overlap with z while avoiding y. So yes, PO(x, z) is possible.

4. TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Let me check if this is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, that means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z. If x is disconnected from y, x could be another part of z that touches the boundary of z. So yes, TPP(x, z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Let me check if this is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, that means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z. If x is disconnected from y, x could be inside z but not touching the boundary of z, and avoiding y. So yes, NTPP(x, z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x, z) (which is TPP(z, x)): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Let me check if this is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, that means y is inside z. If z is a tangential proper part of x, that means z is inside x. But that would mean y is inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So no, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z) (which is NTPP(z, x)): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Let me check if this is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, that means y is inside z. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, that means z is inside x. But that would mean y is inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So no, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): x and z are coincident.
   Let me check if this is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, that means y is inside z. If x and z are the same region, that means y is inside x. But that contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So no, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Let me double-check the above reasoning with specific examples to ensure I haven't missed anything:

1. DC(x, z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a small circle that's inside z and touches the boundary of z, and x as another circle that's completely outside of z. In this case, x and z are disconnected, and x and y are also disconnected.

2. EC(x, z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a small circle that's inside z and touches the boundary of z, and x as another circle that's outside of z but touches the boundary of z at a point where y does not touch. In this case, x and z are externally connected, and x and y are disconnected.

3. PO(x, z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a small circle that's inside z and touches the boundary of z, and x as another circle that overlaps with part of z but avoids y. In this case, x and z partially overlap, and x and y are disconnected.

4. TPP(x, z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a small circle that's inside z and touches the boundary of z, and x as another circle that's inside z, touches the boundary of z, but avoids y. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z, and x and y are disconnected.

5. NTPP(x, z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a small circle that's inside z and touches the boundary of z, and x as another circle that's completely inside z (not touching the boundary of z) and avoids y. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x and y are disconnected.

6. TPPi(x, z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, y is inside z. Therefore, y would be inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and does not touch the boundary of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, y is inside z. Therefore, y would be inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): If x and z are the same region, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then y would be a tangential proper part of x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Those 5 relations are the answer, I believe.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Region x can be completely outside z while y is inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. Region x can touch z's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch it.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Region x can partially overlap with z while remaining disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. Region x can be inside z, touching z's boundary, while still being disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. Region x can be completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) while remaining disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were part of x, then y would also be part of x (since y is part of z), contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as above.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be part of x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
