PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

OK, I'm given two relationships: 
1. EQ(x,y) - which means that x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space)
2. NTPPi(y,z) - which means that y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. So x has the same spatial relationships with other objects as y does.

We're given that NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y) - that is, z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), the relationship between x and z must also be NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, let me double-check this. 

EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are coincident, z must also be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I should be extra careful here. Let me look at the definitions one more time:

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space).
NTPPi(y,z) means that y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary.

So, NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), we can substitute x for y in the relationship with z.

So, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me be more careful, because I think I might be making a mistake here.

EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy the same space.
NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.

Since x is the same as y, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z.

The relationship between y and z is NTPPi(y,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z should also be NTPPi(x,z).

Hmmm, I feel like there's something wrong with my logic. Let me go back to the definitions:

EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space).
NTPPi(y,z) means that z properly contains y without y touching z's boundary.

Actually, I think I might have been making a mistake in my interpretation. Let me re-analyze.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z properly contains y without y touching z's boundary. This is equivalent to NTPP(y,z), where y is properly contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy the same space. So if y is properly contained within z without touching z's boundary, then x is also properly contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z), which is equivalent to NTPPi(z,x).

Wait, I feel like I'm going in circles. Let me be more methodical.

First, let's clarify the definitions:

- EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy the same space.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary. 

So, given EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. So, x has the same spatial relationships with other objects as y does.

The relationship between y and z is NTPPi(y,z), which means z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between x and z must also be that z is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPPi(x,z).

OK so my final answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, wait a moment. Let me check if I understand NTPPi correctly.

"NTPPi(y,z) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. "

Wait, that's not right. The actual definition we're given is:

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So NTPP(x,y) means x is part of y without touching y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) means the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x without touching x's boundary.

OK so NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is part of y without touching y's boundary.

Given EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z):

- EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is part of y without touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between x and z must also be that z is part of x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me try this another way. 

The relationships are:
1. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident
2. NTPPi(y,z) - y is properly contained in z without touching z's boundary

Since x and y are coincident, x is also properly contained in z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, this is different from my previous answer. Let me check again if I understand NTPPi correctly.

From the definition: "NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary.

Given this, the relationship between x and z should be that z is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me be even more careful. The definition says:

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary."
"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) means the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

Given this, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.

Since EQ(x,y), the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z, which is that z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).

OK I think I'm getting confused with directionality, so let me be more careful.

Let's be precise:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP, so it means y is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. So, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z, which is that z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).

Let's try a different approach.

If EQ(x,y), then x and y are the same spatial region.
If NTPPi(y,z), then z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z, which is that z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I got confused earlier. Let me go back to the definitions:

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary."
"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Therefore, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Since EQ(x,y), the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z, which is that z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I keep going in circles. Let me try again from the start.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy the same space.
- NTPPi(y,z): From the definition, NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. So, if z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary, then z is also a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I think my final answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me just double-check my understanding of NTPPi.

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary."
"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y). NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.

Given EQ(x,y), the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z, which is that z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify one more time:

1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z, which is that z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I think I was getting confused because I wasn't consistently applying the definitions. But after going through it multiple times, I'm confident that the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, one last time. NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary. The "i" in NTPPi stands for "inverse," which flips the arguments.

Given this and the fact that EQ(x,y) (x and y are the same region), the relationship between x and z should be NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

Actually, now I'm second-guessing myself. Let me revisit the definition of NTPPi:

"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

This means that NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). From the definition of NTPP:

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary."

So, NTPP(z,y) means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Given that EQ(x,y) (x and y are the same region), if z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary, then z is also part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This would be NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me one more time:
1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z, which is that z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be precise:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given:
1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between y and z, which is that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, my final answer is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given the provided relationships:

1. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space)
2. NTPPi(y,z) - y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary

First, let's understand what NTPPi(y,z) means. From the definition, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical regions. Therefore, any spatial relationship that y has with other regions, x must have the same relationship with those regions.

Given that z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), and x is identical to y (from EQ(x,y)), it follows that z must also be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

This relationship is precisely NTPPi(x,z).
