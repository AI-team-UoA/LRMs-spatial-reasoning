PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We're given that:
- EQ(x,y) which means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
- PO(y,z) which means y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial parts, but neither is fully contained in the other).

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial entity. This means that any spatial relationship that y has with another entity, x will also have the same relationship with that entity.

Given that PO(y,z), and x is equivalent to y, then x must also partially overlap with z.

So, the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- If x and y are coincident (EQ), then they occupy exactly the same space.
- If y partially overlaps with z (PO), then y shares some spatial parts with z but neither is fully contained in the other.
- Since x occupies the same space as y, x must also share the same spatial parts with z that y does.
- Therefore, x must partially overlap with z (PO).

I'm confident that the answer is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me recheck my understanding of the RCC-8 relations to ensure I'm interpreting this correctly:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no spatial parts).
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interiors.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share some spatial parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is fully within y and touches y's boundary).
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is fully within y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equivalent (occupy exactly the same space).

Yes, my understanding seems correct. Given EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

So, the final answer is:
PO(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space), any spatial relationship that y has with z will be the same relationship that x has with z.

Given that PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial parts, but neither is fully contained in the other), and since x is equivalent to y, then x must also partially overlap with z.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
