PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this step by step.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are coincident, or equal. They occupy exactly the same space.

I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are the same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between y and another region also holds between z and that region.

We know that TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. Since z is equal to y (due to EQ(y,z)), z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

So the relationship between x and z must be TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is: TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. 

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident or equal.

Given these two facts, z is equal to y, and y is a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, z is also a tangential proper part of x, which means TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

So my answer is: TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z based on the given conditions:

1) TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained within x and touches x's boundary)

2) EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), any spatial relationship that holds between y and another region must also hold between z and that same region.

We know that y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)). Since z is identical to y, z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the only possible relation is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
