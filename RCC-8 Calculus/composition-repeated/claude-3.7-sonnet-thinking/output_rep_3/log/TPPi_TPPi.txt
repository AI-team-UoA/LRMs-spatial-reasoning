PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
1. y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
2. z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is part of y (from TPPi(y,z)) and y is part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), by transitivity, z is part of x.

So z is definitely a part of x. But is z a proper part of x, and if so, is it tangential or non-tangential?

Since z is a proper part of y (from TPPi(y,z)) and y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), z is a proper part of x.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? We know that z touches the boundary of y (from TPPi(y,z)), and y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)). But does this mean that z touches the boundary of x?

There are two possibilities:
1. z touches the boundary of x. In this case, the relation between x and z would be TPPi(x,z), or equivalently, TPP(z,x).
2. z does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, the relation between x and z would be NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently, NTPP(z,x).

Let's check if both of these possibilities can actually occur.

Possibility 1: TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x)
If z touches the boundary of x, then it means that there is a point on the boundary of x that is also a point in z. But since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, it's possible for z to touch the boundary of x. This would happen if z touches the same part of y's boundary that also forms a part of x's boundary.

Possibility 2: NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x)
If z does not touch the boundary of x, then it means that there is no point on the boundary of x that is also a point in z. This would happen if z only touches parts of y's boundary that are in the interior of x.

Both of these possibilities seem plausible, so I think the answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently, TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

Let me see if there's any reason to exclude one of them.

For TPPi(x,z): The condition is that z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. We've established that z is a proper part of x. For z to touch x's boundary, z would need to share at least one point with the boundary of x. Since z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, it's possible that z touches the same part of y's boundary that also forms a part of x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): The condition is that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. We've established that z is a proper part of x. For z not to touch x's boundary, z would need to be completely in the interior of x. Even though z touches y's boundary, if the part of y's boundary that z touches is entirely in the interior of x, then z would not touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

So I think the correct answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently, TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

But let me think once more about this.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So:
- y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

By transitivity of the part relation, z is a proper part of x.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? We know that z touches the boundary of y, but we don't know if that part of y's boundary is also a part of x's boundary.

Let me imagine a simple spatial scenario:

1. Let x be a large circle.
2. Let y be a smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at a single point.
3. Let z be an even smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y at a single point.

Now, if the point where z touches y's boundary is the same point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary. In this case, TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) holds.

But if the point where z touches y's boundary is not the same as the point where y touches x's boundary, then z doesn't touch x's boundary. In this case, NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) holds.

So it seems like both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z.

Let me check one more time by using the composition table for RCC-8 relations. The composition of TPPi with TPPi should give us the possible relationships between x and z.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of TPPi with TPPi is:
TPPi âˆ˜ TPPi = {TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}

This means that if TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).

But wait, let's reconsider whether EQ(x,z) is actually possible.

EQ(x,z) means that x and z are equal or coincident. But we have that z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x. If z is a proper part of y, then z cannot be equal to y. And if y is a proper part of x, then y cannot be equal to x. So, by transitivity, z cannot be equal to x.

So I think the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently, TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me double-check the composition table again. I think I might have been mistaken.

Actually, let's derive the composition table ourselves:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So:
- y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

The possible relations between x and z are:
1. EQ(x,z): This would mean x = z. But since y is a proper part of x and z is a proper part of y, this would mean z is a proper part of itself, which is not possible. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

2. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, this would mean x is a proper part of itself, which is not possible. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

3. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x. For z to touch the boundary of x, it must touch a point on the boundary of x. This is possible if the point where z touches the boundary of y is also a point on the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

4. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But as we saw in 2, x cannot be a proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x. For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, it must not touch the boundary of x. This is possible if the point where z touches the boundary of y is not on the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x. So z is completely contained in x, not just partially. Thus, PO(x,z) is not possible.

7. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z externally connect, i.e., they touch but don't overlap. But since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x. So z is contained in x, not just touching it. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

8. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x. So z is contained in x, not disconnected from it. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me actually just double-check my work by looking at a more concrete example. 

Imagine three concentric circles: a large circle x, a medium circle y inside x and touching x's boundary at one point, and a small circle z inside y. If z touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary, making TPPi(x,z) true. If z touches y's boundary at a different point, which is inside x, then z doesn't touch x's boundary, making NTPPi(x,z) true.

So based on this concrete example, I can see that both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

So, the answer is:
TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)

Or equivalently:
TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships can hold between x and z when TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are true.

First, let me understand what these given relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary)

From these relations, I can derive:
- Since z is part of y, and y is part of x, then z must be part of x (by transitivity)
- z is definitely a proper part of x

The question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not. There are two possibilities:

1. If z touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary. This gives us TPPi(x,z).

2. If z touches y's boundary only at points that are in the interior of x, then z would not touch x's boundary. This gives us NTPPi(x,z).

Both of these scenarios are geometrically possible given the initial conditions.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
