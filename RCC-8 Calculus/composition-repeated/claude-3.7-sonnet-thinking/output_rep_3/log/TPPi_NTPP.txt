PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, z contains y, and y does not touch z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

To help me think, let me visualize this. We have:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- z contains y, and y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary)

What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

Given that y is inside both x and z, there must be some overlap between x and z. So x and z cannot be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC).

Let's consider the possible relationships:

1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   This is possible if part of x is outside z, and part of z is outside x, while they share y.

2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is possible if x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is possible if z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

6. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   This is possible if x and z occupy exactly the same space.

Let me analyze each of these possibilities in more detail.

TPPi(x,y) means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

1. PO(x,z):
   If x and z partially overlap, y must be in the overlapping region (since y is part of both x and z). This seems possible.

2. TPP(x,z):
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, this seems possible only if the part of x's boundary that y touches is not the same as the part of x's boundary that touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, this seems possible.

4. TPPi(x,z):
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary, this seems possible only if the part of x's boundary that y touches is not the same as the part of x's boundary that z touches.

5. NTPPi(x,z):
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary, this seems contradictory. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y can't touch x's boundary either. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. EQ(x,z):
   If x and z are equal, then y is inside both x and z. Given that y touches x's boundary, it must also touch z's boundary (since x and z are the same). But this contradicts NTPP(y,z), which says y doesn't touch z's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I think I've made a mistake somewhere. Let me reconsider.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, z contains y, and y does not touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is a part of x and touches x's boundary
- y is a part of z and does not touch z's boundary

Let's reason through the possibilities more carefully:

1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   This is possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y being in the overlapping region. Since y touches x's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, the part of x's boundary that y touches must be inside z.

2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x can be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, the part of x's boundary that y touches must not be the part that touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x can be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. In this case, y can touch x's boundary without touching z's boundary.

4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But if y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and z touches x's boundary, then y can't touch x's boundary. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But if y is inside z and y touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary. This contradicts NTPPi(x,z), so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   If x and z are equal, then y is inside both x and z. Since y touches x's boundary, it must also touch z's boundary (because x and z are the same). But this contradicts NTPP(y,z), which says y doesn't touch z's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So it seems that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), because I'm not convinced.

For TPPi(x,z):
TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches x's boundary. NTPP(y,z) means y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

So we have:
- z is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary

If z touches x's boundary, and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then y can't touch x's boundary. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. NTPP(y,z) means y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

So we have:
- z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary

If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y can't touch x's boundary either. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I just realized that there's another issue with my reasoning. TPPi(x,y) doesn't necessarily mean y is inside x, but rather that x is inside y.

Let me restart with clear definitions:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, we want to find the relation between x and z.

We know:
- y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary
- y is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary

Let's analyze the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any parts. But y is a part of both x and z, so this is impossible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected
   If x and z only touch at their boundaries, they don't share any interior parts. But y is an interior part of both x and z, so this is impossible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. y could be in the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This means x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. y would be contained in x, which is contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This means x is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary. This is possible. y would be contained in x, which is contained in z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This means z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary, while y touches x's boundary. If z touches x's boundary and y is contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then y can't touch x's boundary. This contradicts our initial condition, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This means z is properly contained in x and does not touch x's boundary. But we know y is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary, while y touches x's boundary. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then any point in z, including y, can't touch x's boundary. This contradicts our initial condition, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   If x and z are the same, then y is properly contained in both and touches the boundary of both. But this contradicts the condition that y doesn't touch z's boundary, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, let's double check my reasoning for PO(x,z).

PO(x,z) means x and z share a common part, but neither is contained in the other. We know that y is a common part of x and z, so the sharing condition is satisfied. We also need to confirm that neither x is contained in z, nor z is contained in x.

Given TPPi(x,y), y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given NTPP(y,z), y is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

If y touches x's boundary, and y is contained in the overlapping region of x and z, then part of x's boundary must be inside z. This suggests that x isn't entirely outside z. But for PO(x,z), we need x to have parts outside z, and z to have parts outside x.

I need to think about this more carefully. If y touches x's boundary, and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then the part of x's boundary that y touches must be inside z. But x can still have other parts outside z, satisfying the PO condition.

So, yes, PO(x,z) is possible.

I think my analysis of the other relations is correct. So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Hmm, actually, the case of PO(x,z) also deserves more thought. Let's consider it again. If y touches x's boundary, and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then the part of x's boundary that y touches must be inside z. This suggests that at least part of x's boundary must be inside z, not on z's boundary.

But if x and z partially overlap, then the part of x that's inside z must be bounded by a boundary that's also part of z's boundary. This seems to contradict the requirement that y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary.

Let's think about this in terms of regions. If x and z partially overlap, there's a region that's part of both x and z, a region that's part of x but not z, and a region that's part of z but not x. The boundary between the overlap region and the "x but not z" region is part of z's boundary. The boundary between the overlap region and the "z but not x" region is part of x's boundary.

Given that y is in the overlap region (since it's part of both x and z) and y touches x's boundary, it must touch the boundary between the overlap region and the "z but not x" region. But this boundary is also part of z's boundary, so y would also touch z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

So it seems that PO(x,z) is not possible after all.

Actually, I'm not sure if my reasoning above is correct. Let me think about it differently.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary

Let's consider the case where x and z partially overlap. y is in the overlapping region (since it's part of both x and z). Since y touches x's boundary, it touches a point that's on the boundary of x. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, this point can't be on the boundary of z. So this point must be inside z. But if a point is on the boundary of x and inside z, then at least part of x's boundary must be inside z, not on the boundary of the overlapping region. This is still consistent with x and z partially overlapping.

Actually, let me correct myself. Even if x and z partially overlap, with y in the overlapping region, it's not necessary that all of y touches the common boundary. Part of y can touch the boundary that x has with the outside, not with z. In other words, y can touch the part of x's boundary that's inside z.

In fact, let me try to draw a simple diagram to illustrate a possible configuration:

```
    z
  +-----+
  |     |
  |  y  |
  |/////|     x
  +-----+-----+
          |   |
          +---+
```

In this diagram, y is inside both x and z, but it only touches x's boundary, not z's boundary. x and z partially overlap, with y in the overlapping region.

So it seems that PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

I need to go back and review my conclusions:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   This is impossible because y is part of both x and z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected
   This is impossible because y is an interior part of both x and z.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   This is possible as long as y touches the part of x's boundary that's inside z, not the part that's on the boundary of the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x can be completely inside z and touch z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary (but not z's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x can be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is impossible. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y can't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is impossible. If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y can't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   This is impossible. If x and z are the same, then y would touch both x's boundary and z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, wait. I'm not sure about the PO(x,z) case anymore. If part of x's boundary is inside z and not on z's boundary, then is it really a case of partial overlap, or is it a case of x being a tangential proper part of z?

Let me think about this differently. 

If x and z partially overlap, then there's a non-empty region that's part of both x and z, a non-empty region that's part of x but not z, and a non-empty region that's part of z but not x. The boundary between the first and third regions is part of x's boundary. The boundary between the first and second regions is part of z's boundary.

Given that y is in the overlapping region (since it's part of both x and z) and y touches x's boundary, it would touch the boundary between the overlapping region and the "z but not x" region. But this boundary is also part of z's boundary, so y would also touch z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

So, if y touches x's boundary, and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then the part of x's boundary that y touches must be inside z, not on the boundary of the overlapping region. This means x's boundary is partly inside z, which isn't possible if x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

Actually I need to think more clearly about this. Let's return to the definitions.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary.

Let's consider the possibility that x and z partially overlap. In this case, y would have to be in the overlapping region.

If y touches x's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary, then the point where y touches x's boundary must be inside z. This means that at least part of x's boundary is inside z.

But here's the issue: If x and z partially overlap, then the boundary of the overlapping region would consist of parts of both x's boundary and z's boundary. Any part of x's boundary that's inside z would not be part of the boundary of the overlapping region.

If y touches a part of x's boundary that's inside z, not on the boundary of the overlapping region, then this part of x's boundary must be inside z. But in the RCC-8 calculus, if a region is inside another region, the entire boundary of the first region is considered to be inside the second region. This means that all of x's boundary would be inside z, and x wouldn't have any part outside z.

This contradicts the assumption that x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double check this because I'm not convinced about my understanding of the RCC-8 calculus.

Actually, I think I'm incorrect. In the RCC-8 calculus, it's possible for a region to have part of its boundary inside another region and part of its boundary outside. This would be the case if the regions partially overlap.

I think the issue is that I'm assuming that y touching x's boundary means that all of y touches x's boundary, which is not necessarily the case. It's possible that only part of y touches x's boundary, and this part can be inside z without touching z's boundary.

Let me try to draw a diagram to illustrate a possible configuration:

```
    z
  +-----+
  |     |
  |  y--|     x
  |/////|-----+
  +-----+     |
              |
              +
```

In this diagram, y is inside both x and z, and it touches x's boundary but not z's boundary. x and z partially overlap, with y in the overlapping region.

So, it seems that PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Wait, actually I think I might have been right the first time, but for the wrong reason. Let's think about this differently.

If y touches x's boundary, and y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then there must be a point that's on x's boundary, inside y, and inside z but not on z's boundary. This point must be part of z, which means it's in the interior of z. But if a point is on x's boundary and in the interior of z, then at least part of x's boundary is inside z, not on the boundary of the overlapping region.

If x and z partially overlap, then the boundary of the overlapping region would consist of parts of both x's boundary and z's boundary. If y touches a part of x's boundary that's inside z, not on the boundary of the overlapping region, then this part of x's boundary must be inside z.

But if part of x's boundary is inside z and not on the boundary of the overlapping region, this means that the boundary of x crosses the boundary of z and goes back inside. This is not a case of x and z partially overlapping, but rather a case of one region having a "hole" or a concave shape. 

This is actually a limitation of the RCC-8 calculus, as it doesn't distinguish between different types of partial overlap. But in the standard interpretation of PO in RCC-8, it means that the regions share some parts but neither is contained in the other, and the boundaries of the regions intersect to form a simple closed curve.

So, with this understanding, if part of x's boundary is inside z and not on the boundary of the overlapping region, then the regions don't simply partially overlap. Rather, x is a proper part of z, possibly tangential (if x touches z's boundary) or non-tangential (if x doesn't touch z's boundary).

Given that y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary, x's boundary must be inside z and not on z's boundary. This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I'm overthinking this and causing unnecessary confusion. Let's simplify the reasoning and consider all possibilities directly.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary

Let's consider each of the eight RCC-8 relations and check if they're consistent with these conditions:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any parts. But y is a part of both x and z, so DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected
   If x and z only touch at their boundaries, they don't share any interior parts. But y is an interior part of both x and z, so EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior parts, and both have parts that are not shared. Since y is an interior part of both x and z, it must be in the overlapping region. Given that y touches x's boundary, the part of x's boundary that y touches must be inside z (since y doesn't touch z's boundary). This means at least part of x's boundary is inside z, which is consistent with x and z partially overlapping. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, the part of x's boundary that y touches can't be the part that touches z's boundary. This is possible if x has a more complex shape. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, x is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with y not touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. y is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then y can't touch x's boundary. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), so TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y can't touch x's boundary. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), so NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   If x and z are the same, then y is properly contained in both and touches the boundary of both. But this contradicts the condition that y doesn't touch z's boundary, so EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

I'm satisfied with this conclusion.

Actually, wait. I think I need to double check my understanding of PO(x,z). If there's a part of x's boundary that's inside z and y touches this part, then it seems like x must be "invaginated" into z (like a U-shape), which might not be a simple case of partial overlap.

Let's reconsider this. In RCC-8, PO(x,z) means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. If y touches x's boundary and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then the part of x's boundary that y touches must be inside z, not on z's boundary. This implies that at least part of x's boundary is inside z, not on the boundary of the overlapping region.

If x's boundary is partly inside z, not on the boundary of the overlapping region, it would mean that x has a concave shape and part of it is "invaginated" into z. I'm not sure if this is still considered a case of simple partial overlap in RCC-8, or if it falls under a different relation.

However, I need to remember that RCC-8 is a topological calculus, not a geometric one. It cares about connectivity, not shape. So, regardless of shape, if x and z share some parts but neither is contained in the other, then PO(x,z) holds.

Given that y is in the overlapping region (since it's part of both x and z), y touches x's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, the part of x's boundary that y touches must be inside z, not on z's boundary. This doesn't change the fact that x and z share some parts but neither is contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is still a valid possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

I've rechecked my reasoning, and I'm quite confident in this conclusion. Let me do one more check, just to be sure.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary

For PO(x,z), we need x and z to share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. Given that y is part of both x and z, they do share some parts. We also need to ensure that neither x is contained in z, nor z is contained in x. The condition that y touches x's boundary suggests that at least part of x's boundary is inside z, not on z's boundary. But this doesn't necessarily mean that all of x is inside z. x could have parts outside z, and z could have parts outside x, satisfying the PO condition.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be properly contained in z and touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, the part of x's boundary that y touches must not be the part that touches z's boundary. This is possible if x has a complex shape.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be properly contained in z and not touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, y doesn't touch z's boundary, which is consistent with x not touching z's boundary.

For the remaining relations (DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ), we've already shown that they're not consistent with the given conditions.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

So I am sure the final answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the implications of the given relations:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary.

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least one point.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible because y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y in the overlapping region. Since y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, the part of x's boundary that y touches must be inside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be properly contained in z and touch z's boundary. Since y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, the part of x's boundary that y touches can't be the part that touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be properly contained in z without touching z's boundary. In this case, y can touch x's boundary while still being entirely in the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z is a proper part of x touching x's boundary, and y is inside z not touching z's boundary, then y couldn't touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z is completely inside x not touching x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y couldn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z are identical, then y would have to both touch and not touch the same boundary.
