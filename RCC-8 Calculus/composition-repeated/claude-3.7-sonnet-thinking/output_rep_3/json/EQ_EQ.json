{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then I need to determine the relationship between x and z.\n\nSince:\n- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same space)\n- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (occupy exactly the same space)\n\nGiven that x and y occupy exactly the same space, and y and z occupy exactly the same space, it follows that x and z must also occupy exactly the same space.\n\nThe relation EQ is transitive: if x equals y and y equals z, then x equals z.\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 7.092005491256714, "reasoning-tokens": 383, "completion-tokens": 383}
