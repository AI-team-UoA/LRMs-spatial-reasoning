PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

First, we have NTPPi(x,y), which is the same as NTPP(y,x). This means that y is a proper part of x and y does not touch x's boundary.

Second, we have NTPP(y,z), which means that y is a proper part of z and y does not touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x, not touching x's boundary.
- y is a proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's go through all the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
   Is this possible? We know that y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
   Is this possible? Again, we know that y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least y, which is an interior part. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
   Is this possible? We know that y is part of both x and z, so they do share a spatial part. But can we rule out that either is part of the other? We know that y is a proper part of both x and z, but this doesn't tell us about the relationship between x and z directly. So PO(x,z) seems possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
   Is this possible? We know that y is a proper part of both x and z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of either. Could x be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary? This seems possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
   Is this possible? Yes, it's possible that x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
   Is this possible? We know that y is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x. So z could be part of x, but would it touch x's boundary? If z is part of x and touches x's boundary, and y is part of z not touching z's boundary, then y would not touch x's boundary, which is consistent with what we know. So TPPi(x,z) seems possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
   Is this possible? We know that y is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x. So z could be part of x, and if z doesn't touch x's boundary, then y wouldn't touch x's boundary, which is consistent with what we know. So NTPPi(x,z) seems possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   Is this possible? If x and z are the same, then y would be a proper part of both, not touching the boundary of either. This is consistent with what we know, so EQ(x,z) seems possible.

But wait, I think I'm missing something. Let's reconsider.

We have:
- NTPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's think more carefully about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible, as explained earlier.
2. EC(x,z): Impossible, as explained earlier.
3. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. Given that y is contained in both, this is indeed possible if x extends beyond z in some regions and z extends beyond x in others.
4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is contained in both, this is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is contained in both, this is possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is contained in both, this is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is contained in both, this is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. Given that y is contained in both, this is possible if x and z are indeed the same.

Actually, let me rethink this once more. The knowledge that y is a proper part of both x and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of either, doesn't give us enough constraints to eliminate many of the possible relationships between x and z.

Wait, I'm just thinking about this more carefully. We know:
- y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given these, the following must be true:
1. x and z must overlap (because they both contain y).
2. Neither x nor z can be completely disjoint from the other.

But beyond that, we don't have much more information. x could be a part of z, z could be a part of x, or they could partially overlap, and we don't have any constraints on whether they touch the boundary of the other.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same.

So that gives us PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ as possible relationships between x and z.

Hmm, wait. Let me reconsider. I'm not sure if all of these are actually possible. Let's try to see if we can eliminate some of them.

We know:
- NTPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

1. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same, then y is a proper part of both, which is consistent with what we know. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

2. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they would share a part (which includes y), but neither would be part of the other. This is consistent with what we know. So PO(x,z) is possible.

3. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then y, being a proper part of x not touching x's boundary, would also be a proper part of z not touching z's boundary (since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and x doesn't extend beyond z's boundary). This is consistent with what we know. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

4. NTPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y, being a proper part of x not touching x's boundary, would also be a proper part of z not touching z's boundary. This is consistent with what we know. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

5. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then y, being a proper part of z not touching z's boundary, would be a proper part of x not touching x's boundary. This is consistent with what we know. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y, being a proper part of z not touching z's boundary, would be a proper part of x not touching x's boundary. This is consistent with what we know. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

OK, so all of PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are possible.

Actually, wait. Let me think more carefully about each of these cases.

We have:
- NTPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

I should create a mental picture for each of these cases and see if they're all truly possible.

1. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. This means y is a proper part of x, which is the same as z. So y is a proper part of z. This is consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

2. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means there are parts of x that are not in z, and there are parts of z that are not in x. But there is a part that they share, which includes y. This is consistent. So PO(x,z) is possible.

3. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This means all of x, including y, is within z. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and x doesn't extend beyond z, y doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

4. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means all of x, including y, is within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, y doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

5. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This means all of z, including y, is within x. But wait, if z touches x's boundary, could y touch x's boundary? We know y doesn't touch x's boundary. So for this to be consistent, y would have to be away from the part of z that touches x's boundary. This is possible because y doesn't touch z's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This means all of z, including y, is within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since y is within z, and z doesn't touch x's boundary, y doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So it seems that all of PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are possible relations between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

But wait! Actually, let's continue to analyze these relations. 

I think it's also helpful to use the composition table for RCC-8 to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

NTPPi(x,y) ∘ NTPP(y,z) means the composition of NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), which gives the possible relationships between x and z.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, NTPPi ∘ NTPP = {PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}.

So the answer is PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

But let me just double-check by thinking about it directly:

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So y is a proper part of both x and z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of either.

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means there are parts of x that are not in z, and there are parts of z that are not in x. But they share a part, which includes y. This is consistent with what we know. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This means all of x, including y, is within z. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and x doesn't extend beyond z, y doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with what we know. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means all of x, including y, is within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, y doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with what we know. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This means all of z, including y, is within x. Since z touches x's boundary, some part of z must touch x's boundary. We know y doesn't touch z's boundary, so y can't be the part of z that touches x's boundary. But y could be elsewhere in z, away from where z touches x's boundary. This is consistent with what we know. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This means all of z, including y, is within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since y is within z, and z doesn't touch x's boundary, y doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with what we know. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. This means y is a proper part of x, which is the same as z. So y is a proper part of z. This is consistent with what we know. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Interesting note: The RCC-8 relations DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected) are not possible for x and z. This makes sense because we know that y is a part of both x and z, so they must share at least y. Therefore, they can't be disconnected or merely externally connected.

Actually, let me perform one more check on my logic:

1. PO(x,z): The defining feature of PO is that x and z overlap but neither is contained in the other. We can achieve this as follows. Let's say y is a disk in the middle of a larger disk x. And let's say z is another disk that covers part of x, including y, but neither is contained in the other. This is a valid case of PO(x,z).

2. TPP(x,z): The defining feature of TPP is that x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. We can achieve this as follows. Let's say y is a disk, x is a larger disk containing y, and z is an even larger disk containing x such that the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. This is a valid case of TPP(x,z).

3. NTPP(x,z): The defining feature of NTPP is that x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We can achieve this as follows. Let's say y is a disk, x is a larger disk containing y, and z is an even larger disk containing x such that the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is a valid case of NTPP(x,z).

4. TPPi(x,z): The defining feature of TPPi is that z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. We can achieve this as follows. Let's say y is a disk, z is a larger disk containing y, and x is an even larger disk containing z such that the boundary of z touches the boundary of x. This is a valid case of TPPi(x,z).

5. NTPPi(x,z): The defining feature of NTPPi is that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We can achieve this as follows. Let's say y is a disk, z is a larger disk containing y, and x is an even larger disk containing z such that the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is a valid case of NTPPi(x,z).

6. EQ(x,z): The defining feature of EQ is that x and z are the same. We can achieve this if x = z. In this case, y would be a proper part of both x and z, as required.

So all of PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ. The RCC-8 relations DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected) are not possible for x and z because y is a part of both x and z, so they must share at least y.

Actually, I'm going to use one more approach. I'm going to analyze this in terms of the subset relationships and boundary relationships.

First, let's clarify our statements and then think through this methodically.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper subset of x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper subset of z, and y does not touch the boundary of z.

So, y is a proper subset of both x and z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of either.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

DC(x,z): This means x and z are disjoint. But we know y is a subset of both x and z, so x and z must share at least y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. Again, we know y is a subset of both x and z, so x and z must share at least y, which consists of interior points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible. For example, x could contain parts that z doesn't, and z could contain parts that x doesn't, but they both contain y.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z, and x touches the boundary of z. This is possible. For example, x could be a proper subset of z, where the boundary of x touches the boundary of z, and both contain y, which doesn't touch the boundary of either.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible. For example, x could be a proper subset of z, where the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z, and both contain y, which doesn't touch the boundary of either.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x, and z touches the boundary of x. This is possible. For example, z could be a proper subset of x, where the boundary of z touches the boundary of x, and both contain y, which doesn't touch the boundary of either.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible. For example, z could be a proper subset of x, where the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of x, and both contain y, which doesn't touch the boundary of either.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. This is possible. If x = z, then y is a proper subset of both, and y doesn't touch the boundary of either.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me think this through one more time using mereotopology and the RCC-8 calculus.

Let's denote the interior of a region r as i(r) and the boundary of a region r as b(r).

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y ⊂ x and y ∩ b(x) = ∅. In other words, y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z): This means y ⊂ z and y ∩ b(z) = ∅. In other words, y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's consider the RCC-8 relations for x and z:

DC(x,z): This means x ∩ z = ∅. But we know y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, so y ⊂ (x ∩ z), which means x ∩ z ≠ ∅. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This means i(x) ∩ i(z) = ∅ and x ∩ z ≠ ∅. But we know y ⊂ i(x) and y ⊂ i(z), so y ⊂ (i(x) ∩ i(z)), which means i(x) ∩ i(z) ≠ ∅. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): This means x ∩ z ≠ ∅, x ⊈ z, and z ⊈ x. We know x ∩ z ≠ ∅ because y ⊂ (x ∩ z). There's no constraint from our given information that would make x ⊂ z or z ⊂ x, so PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): This means x ⊂ z and x ∩ b(z) ≠ ∅. Again, there's no constraint from our given information that would prevent x from being a proper part of z and touching the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means x ⊂ z and x ∩ b(z) = ∅. Again, there's no constraint from our given information that would prevent x from being a proper part of z and not touching the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means z ⊂ x and z ∩ b(x) ≠ ∅. Again, there's no constraint from our given information that would prevent z from being a proper part of x and touching the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z ⊂ x and z ∩ b(x) = ∅. Again, there's no constraint from our given information that would prevent z from being a proper part of x and not touching the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x = z. Again, there's no constraint from our given information that would prevent x and z from being the same. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me apply the composition table for RCC-8, which I alluded to earlier.

The composition of two RCC-8 relations R and S, denoted as R ∘ S, gives the possible RCC-8 relations that can hold between two regions x and z, given that there exists a region y such that R(x,y) and S(y,z).

In our case, we want to find NTPPi ∘ NTPP, which is the set of possible relations that can hold between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

According to the RCC-8 composition table, NTPPi ∘ NTPP = {PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

This is consistent with our direct reasoning above. So I'm confident in this answer.

To summarize: The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me clarify what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y doesn't touch x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch z's boundary

Since y is part of both x and z, we can immediately rule out:
- DC(x,z): impossible because x and z must share at least y
- EC(x,z): impossible because x and z share interior points (at least y)

Let's analyze the remaining possibilities:

- PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can overlap without either being fully contained in the other
- TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary
- NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a proper part of z without touching z's boundary
- TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary
- EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be identical regions

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
