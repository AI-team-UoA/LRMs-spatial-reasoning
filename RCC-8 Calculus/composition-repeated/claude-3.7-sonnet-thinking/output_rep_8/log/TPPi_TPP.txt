PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the conditions we're given:
1. TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, x is a tangential proper part inverse of y. In simpler terms, y is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.

2. TPP(y,z): This means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

Now I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given these conditions. Let's reason through this systematically:

Since TPPi(x,y), we know that y is contained in x, touching the boundary of x.
Since TPP(y,z), we know that y is contained in z, touching the boundary of z.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This would mean that x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is a shared region between x and z (y is part of both x and z), so x and z must share at least some space.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior. This is possible if y is at the boundary of both x and z. Since y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, it can be arranged such that y is at the boundary of both, and the boundary of x and z touch exactly where y is, without any other overlap.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean that x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but not entirely contained in each other. This is certainly possible. y is a common part, but x could extend outside of z in some areas, and z could extend outside of x in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z (x is entirely contained in z, touching the boundary of z). This is possible if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary, with y being the region where x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is entirely contained in z without touching the boundary of z). This is not possible because y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)), and y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), so x must also touch the boundary of z at the point where y does.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x (z is entirely contained in x, touching the boundary of x). This is possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary, with y being the region where z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is entirely contained in x without touching the boundary of x). This is not possible because y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)), so z must also touch the boundary of x at the point where y does.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are spatially equivalent. This is possible if x and z are the same region, with y as a tangential proper part of both.

Let me double-check these conclusions:

For DC(x,z), since y is part of both x and z, they cannot be disconnected.

For EC(x,z), I initially thought this was possible, but now I'm reconsidering. If y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, then y must have some interior. And if y has interior, then both x and z must contain that interior, which means they must partially overlap at least. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z), since y is a common part, and y has interior, x and z must share some interior. Additionally, since y is a proper part of both, there must be parts of x not in z, and parts of z not in x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z), this would mean x is entirely within z, touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is a proper subset of z, with y being where x touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), this would mean x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary. But since y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), and y is part of x, x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), this would mean z is entirely within x, touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is a proper subset of x, with y being where z touches x's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z), this would mean z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary. But since y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is part of z, z must also touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), this would mean x and z are the same region. This is possible if x and z are identical, with y as a tangential proper part of both.

Let me reconsider again to make sure:

Wait, I think I overlooked something. If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z from the inside. And if TPPi(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x from the outside. Given these constraints, the boundary of x and the boundary of z must intersect at some point (specifically, where y touches both boundaries).

This means that DC(x,z) is definitely not possible, as the boundaries of x and z intersect.

EC(x,z) could be possible if the boundaries of x and z touch, but their interiors don't overlap. However, we know that y has interior, and y is part of both x and z, so their interiors must overlap. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z) is possible if x and z share some interior (which they do through y), but neither is a subset of the other. In other words, some of x extends outside of z, and some of z extends outside of x.

Let's consider a 2D example: Imagine y is a rectangle. Let's say x is a larger rectangle that contains y, with y touching the boundary of x in the top-right corner. And z is a different larger rectangle that also contains y, with y touching the boundary of z in the bottom-left corner. In this setup, x and z partially overlap, with y being the common region. So PO(x,z) is possible.

Let me actually go back and think about TPP and TPPi a bit more. It's been a while since I worked with RCC-8.

TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b, which means a is entirely contained within b, and a touches the boundary of b. Put another way, the interior and boundary of a are fully contained within the union of the interior and boundary of b, and the boundaries of a and b share at least one point.

TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b), so it means that b is a tangential proper part of a.

OK, so let's get back to our question.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely within x, and y touches the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is entirely within z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, sharing no points. This can't happen because y is a shared region between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch only at their boundaries. This can't happen because y is a shared region with interior, which means x and z must share some interior points.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but not all. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas, with y being the common region.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely within z, and x touches the boundary of z. This is possible if x is a subset of z, and since y touches the boundary of z, and y is within x, x also touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely within z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This isn't possible because we know y touches the boundary of z, and y is within x, so x must also touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely within x, and z touches the boundary of x. This is possible if z is a subset of x, and since y touches the boundary of x, and y is within z, z also touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely within x, but z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This isn't possible because we know y touches the boundary of x, and y is within z, so z must also touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is possible if x and z are identical, with y as a tangential proper part of both.

OK, so the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

But wait, let me double-check TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) again, because I think I might be missing something.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z, and x must touch the boundary of z. We know that y is a proper part of both x and z, and y touches the boundary of z. So it's possible for x to be a proper part of z, and for x to touch the boundary of z (via y). So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x, and z must touch the boundary of x. We know that y is a proper part of both x and z, and y touches the boundary of x. So it's possible for z to be a proper part of x, and for z to touch the boundary of x (via y). So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

So my conclusion is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

But I want to try and think one more time. I'm finding it helpful to reason about this using examples.

For PO(x,z), imagine a scenario where x and z are both rectangles, and y is a smaller rectangle situated in the corner where x and z overlap.

For TPP(x,z), imagine a scenario where z is a rectangle, x is a smaller rectangle within z, and y is an even smaller rectangle within x, with y touching the boundary of x at the top and touching the boundary of z at the bottom.

For TPPi(x,z), imagine a scenario where x is a rectangle, z is a smaller rectangle within x, and y is an even smaller rectangle within z, with y touching the boundary of z at the top and touching the boundary of x at the bottom.

For EQ(x,z), imagine a scenario where x and z are the same rectangle, and y is a smaller rectangle within both, touching the boundary of both.

All of these scenarios satisfy our conditions, so our possible answers seem correct.

OK, so the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me think about these once more. The key to understand the constraints is to think about where y intersects the boundaries of x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y touches the boundary of x from the inside.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So y touches the boundary of z from the inside.

For x and z to be equal (EQ), they would have to be the same region. But if y touches the boundary of x from the inside, and y touches the boundary of z from the inside, then x and z can't be the same region unless y touches the boundary at the exact same place. That's possible, so EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

For x to be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), x would have to be entirely within z, touching the boundary of z. Since y is within x and touches the boundary of z, x must also touch the boundary of z at that point. And since y is a proper part of x, there's room for x to be a proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For z to be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)), z would have to be entirely within x, touching the boundary of x. Since y is within z and touches the boundary of x, z must also touch the boundary of x at that point. And since y is a proper part of z, there's room for z to be a proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For x and z to partially overlap (PO(x,z)), they would share some interior, but neither would be a subset of the other. Since y is within both x and z, they share some interior. And there's no constraint forcing one to be a subset of the other. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

Now, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)), x would have to be entirely within z, not touching the boundary of z. But since y touches the boundary of z, and y is within x, x must also touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Similarly, for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)), z would have to be entirely within x, not touching the boundary of x. But since y touches the boundary of x, and y is within z, z must also touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

For x and z to be externally connected (EC(x,z)), they would touch only at their boundaries. But since y is within both x and z, they share some interior. So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

For x and z to be disconnected (DC(x,z)), they would share no points. But since y is within both x and z, they share some interior. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Hmm, after reading this through I'm still wondering about the EQ(x,z) case. I wonder if that's truly possible.

So we have TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y is completely inside x and y touches the boundary of x.

And we have TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is completely inside z and y touches the boundary of z.

If x = z (i.e., EQ(x,z)), then TPPi(x,y) would mean the same as TPPi(z,y), and TPP(y,z) would mean the same as TPP(y,x). But TPPi(z,y) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means they are the same relation. And TPP(y,x) is the inverse of TPPi(x,y), which again means they are the same relation.

That means if EQ(x,z), then TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would have to be the same relation. But they're not the same relation; they're inverses of each other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I just contradicted my earlier reasoning. Let me step back and think about this more carefully:

Actually, this is incorrect reasoning, because TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are relations between different pairs of objects. If we have EQ(x,z), then indeed, TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(z,y) are the same statement, and TPP(y,z) and TPP(y,x) are the same statement. But TPPi(z,y) and TPP(y,z) are not the same relation; they're still inverses of each other.

So, actually, EQ(x,z) is still a possibility.

Actually, wait a second, I'm getting confused. Let me again just think from scratch:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y is completely inside x and y touches the boundary of x. It also means that y is a proper part of x, which means y is not equal to x.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is completely inside z and y touches the boundary of z. It also means that y is a proper part of z, which means y is not equal to z.

Now, if EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. So, if y is a tangential proper part of x, it must also be a tangential proper part of z. And if y is a tangential proper part of z, it must also be a tangential proper part of x.

So, if EQ(x,z), then TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPPi(z,y), and TPP(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(y,x).

But TPPi(z,y) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means they are mutually exclusive (they can't both be true for the same pair of objects). And TPP(y,x) is the inverse of TPPi(x,y), which means they are also mutually exclusive.

So, if EQ(x,z), we would have both TPPi(z,y) and TPP(y,z), which is a contradiction. Hence, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

OK, let me think again. For RCC-8, the TPP and TPPI (or TPPi) relations are inverses of each other in the following sense:

TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b.
TPPi(a,b) means that b is a tangential proper part of a. This is equivalent to TPP(b,a).

So, we have:
TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x).
TPP(y,z) is as stated.

Given these, if EQ(x,z), then:
TPP(y,x) is equivalent to TPP(y,z), since x = z.

But we can't have both TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z) if x = z, because TPP(y,x) is saying "y is a tangential proper part of x", and TPP(y,z) is saying "y is a tangential proper part of z". If x = z, these statements are identical. And since in RCC-8, the relations are mutually exclusive, we can't have the same relation (TPP) for the same pair of objects. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I got confused. The above reasoning isn't correct. The relations in RCC-8 are indeed mutually exclusive, but here we're talking about different pairs: (y,x) and (y,z). The fact that x = z doesn't change the fact that these are considered different "pairs" in the context of the relation, even though they represent the same set of points.

In other words, if x = z, then TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z) are the same statement, not different statements that contradict each other.

So, I've been overthinking this, and EQ(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, hold on. Let me examine the EQ(x,z) case more carefully again.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x, y touches the boundary of x, and y is not equal to x.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is contained within z, y touches the boundary of z, and y is not equal to z.

Now, if EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. But this means y, which is a proper part of x, is also a proper part of z. And as a tangential proper part, y touches the boundary of both x and z (which are the same).

Actually, I see no inherent contradiction here. It's perfectly possible for y to be a tangential proper part of both x and z, and for x and z to be the same region. It's equivalent to saying "y is a tangential proper part of x" twice, which is consistent.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I think there is a problem with the EQ(x,z) case after all. Let me reason through this using the properties of the RCC-8 relations.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. It implies that y is a proper part of x, which means y is not equal to x.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. It implies that y is a proper part of z, which means y is not equal to z.

Now, EQ(x,z) means that x and z are the same region.

If EQ(x,z) and TPPi(x,y), then TPPi(z,y) (since x and z are the same). This means y is a tangential proper part of z.

But we also have TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z.

However, in the RCC-8 calculus, the relations are mutually exclusive. A region can't both be a tangential proper part and a tangential proper part of another region. That would be a contradiction.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. TPPi(z,y) is not saying "z is a tangential proper part of y"; it's saying "y is a tangential proper part of z". And that's the same as TPP(y,z). So there's no contradiction.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's use the actual definitions and see if there's a contradiction:

TPPi(x,y) means that TPP(y,x). That is, y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z.

Now, if EQ(x,z), then TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z) are the same statement because x and z are the same region. There's no contradiction here.

So, EQ(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

But just to be sure, let me try to construct a concrete example where EQ(x,z) and the given relations hold:

Imagine that x and z are both the same square, and y is a smaller square inside x (and thus also inside z) with one corner touching the boundary of x (and thus also the boundary of z). In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both hold, and x and z are the same region (EQ(x,z)).

Ok, so the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, hold on, I think I have been overcomplicated this the whole time! Let me reason in a much more direct way:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

We're asked to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

The core constraint here is that y is a common region, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z from the inside.

Possibilities:
1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of both x and z, they share a region, and thus cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of both x and z, they share interior, and thus cannot be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is contained within the other. This is definitely possible. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, there can be a portion of x that is outside of z, and a portion of z that is outside of x, while y is the common region.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. That is, x is wholly contained within z, and x touches the boundary of z. Given that y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, x would also touch the boundary of z at that point. And since y is a proper part of x, there's room for x to be a proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, x is wholly contained within z, but x does not touch the boundary of z. This is not possible. Given that y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, x would also touch the boundary of z at that point.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. That is, z is wholly contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x. Given that y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, z would also touch the boundary of x at that point. And since y is a proper part of z, there's room for z to be a proper part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, z is wholly contained within x, but z does not touch the boundary of x. This is not possible. Given that y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, z would also touch the boundary of x at that point.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. I've wrestled with this, but I think this is possible. If x and z are the same region, then TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both state that y is a tangential proper part of the same region (x = z). There's no contradiction here. I can easily visualize this: x (and z) is a square, and y is a smaller square inside, touching the boundary at one point.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Wait, I just had a thought. Let me check the EQ(x,z) case one more time from a slightly different angle.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

If x = z, then y is a tangential proper part of the same region. 

I don't see a contradiction here. It's as if we're saying "y is a tangential proper part of x" and "y is a tangential proper part of x" (because x = z). This is redundant, but not contradictory.

Again, I think EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

OK, so the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I just realized that I might have been wrong. 

Let's reconsider TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP(y,x), which means it's saying that y is a tangential proper part of x.
And we have TPP(y,z): This is saying that y is a tangential proper part of z.

OK, so TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both say that y is a tangential proper part of x and z, respectively.

If x = z, then y is a tangential proper part of the same region, which is consistent. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

I've been overthinking this, and the confusion has been unnecessary. The possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, it's occurred to me that the problem with my thinking might be with the interpretation of TPPi. Let me double check what TPPi(x,y) means again.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means it's equivalent to TPP(y,x).

TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b. That is, a is a proper part of b, and a touches the boundary of b.

So TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.

And TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is a proper part of z, and y touches the boundary of z.

So TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both say that y is a tangential proper part of x and z, respectively.

Actually let me check the logic one last time:

We are given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

Together, these mean y is a common region between x and z, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z from the inside.

The possible relationships between x and z, given these constraints, are:
- PO(x,z): x and z overlap, but neither is contained within the other. This is possible. y is the common region, and there are portions of x outside of z, and portions of z outside of x.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is wholly contained within z, and x touches the boundary of z. Since y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, x would also touch the boundary of z at that point. And since y is a proper part of x, there's room for x to be a proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is wholly contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x. Since y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, z would also touch the boundary of x at that point. And since y is a proper part of z, there's room for z to be a proper part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same region, then TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both state that y is a tangential proper part of the same region (x = z). This is consistent, so EQ(x,z) is possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

So the answer to the question of what are the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), is:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given that TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me analyze what these conditions tell us:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Going through each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible since y is part of both x and z, so they must share some region.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible since y has interior points in both x and z, so they share more than just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap with y in the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be contained in z, touching z's boundary (which happens where y touches z's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - since y touches the boundary of z and y is in x, x must also touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be contained in x, touching x's boundary (which happens where y touches x's boundary).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - since y touches the boundary of x and y is in z, z must also touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be the same region, with y as a tangential proper part of both.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
