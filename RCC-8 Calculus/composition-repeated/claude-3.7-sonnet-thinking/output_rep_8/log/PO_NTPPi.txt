PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we're given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is contained in the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that PO(x,y), we know that x shares some part with y, but not all of x is in y, and not all of y is in x.

Given that NTPPi(y,z), or equivalently NTPP(z,y), we know that z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.

Let's consider the possibilities for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share an interior. Given that z is strictly inside y (away from y's boundary), and x partially overlaps with y, x and z might touch at a boundary.

Wait, that's not correct. Since z is strictly inside y (away from y's boundary), and x only partially overlaps with y, if x and z were to touch, they would share interior points, not just boundary points.

So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y also overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems unlikely given the constraints. For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But z is strictly inside y, and x is only partially inside y. So, x can't be completely inside z.

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, this seems unlikely. For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z, away from z's boundary. But since x is only partially inside y and z is strictly inside y, x can't be completely inside z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x, away from x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This seems unlikely given the constraints. For x and z to be coincident, they would have to be the same spatial region. But since x is partially outside y and z is strictly inside y, x and z can't be the same.

So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me revisit my reasoning and check for any inconsistencies or errors.

Given PO(x,y), there's a region that is part of both x and y. Let's call this region o (for overlap).

Given NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y), z is a proper subset of y, and no part of z touches the boundary of y.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z shouldn't share any points. But if the overlap region o between x and y contains any part of z, then x and z would not be disconnected. However, if o doesn't contain any part of z, then x and z would be disconnected.

So, DC(x,z) is possible if the overlap region between x and y doesn't contain any part of z.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z should touch at a boundary but not share an interior. But since z is strictly inside y, it doesn't touch y's boundary. So, if x and z were to touch, they would share interior points, not just boundary points.

Upon reflection, I realize there's another aspect to consider. The region of y that doesn't overlap with x (let's call it y-x) could contain z entirely, or it could contain only part of z, or it might not contain z at all.

If y-x contains z entirely, then x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) would be true.

If y-x contains only part of z, then the remaining part of z would overlap with o, which is the overlap region between x and y. In this case, x and z would partially overlap, so PO(x,z) would be true.

If y-x doesn't contain z at all, then z would be entirely contained within o. Given that o is a subset of x, z would be entirely contained within x. Since z is strictly inside y, it's possible that z could be strictly inside x too, in which case NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) would be true. Alternatively, z could touch the boundary of x within y, in which case TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z) would be true.

But wait, I need to reconsider this more carefully. Let me use the original statements and deduce the possible relations:

1. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained within z, away from z's boundary.

Wait, I made a mistake. NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. Let me correct that.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z.

From PO(x,y), we know there's a region o that is part of both x and y. We also know there's a region p that is part of x but not of y, and a region q that is part of y but not of x.

From NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y), we know z is fully contained within y, away from y's boundary.

Now, the key question is: how can z be positioned relative to the regions o and q?

If z is fully contained within q, then x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) would be true.

If z overlaps with both o and q, then x and z would partially overlap, so PO(x,z) would be true.

If z is fully contained within o, then z would be a part of x. But z doesn't touch y's boundary, so it won't touch the boundary of o (which is part of y). Since o is only a part of x, z might or might not touch the boundary of x. If z touches the boundary of x (from inside), then TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z) would be true. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) would be true.

I realize I've been overthinking this. Let me reconsider a bit more carefully.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a part, but neither is contained in the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained within z, away from z's boundary.

Actually, no, I got it wrong again. Let me define the RCC-8 relations more clearly:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is fully contained within y, away from y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP. It means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of NTPP. It means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy the same space.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained within z, away from z's boundary.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z.

Given PO(x,y), x and y have a common part, but neither is contained in the other. Also, given NTPPi(y,z), y is fully contained within z, away from z's boundary.

Let's consider each possible relationship:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since y overlaps with x and y is fully contained within z, it's not possible for x and z to be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. But since y overlaps with x and y is fully contained within z, x and z must share some interior parts. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since y overlaps with x and y is fully contained within z, there's a common part between x and z. But since x is not fully contained in y, it's possible that x is not fully contained in z. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If all of x is contained in z and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If all of x is contained in z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But since y is fully contained in z and y overlaps with x, it's not possible for all of z to be contained in x (as some of z would be outside of y).

Wait, that's wrong. If y is fully contained in z, it's not necessarily the case that z is fully contained in y. In fact, given NTPPi(y,z), it's the opposite: y is fully contained in z.

Let's be careful here. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is fully contained in y, away from y's boundary.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a part, but neither is contained in the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is fully contained in y, away from y's boundary.

Ok, so let's try again. Now the relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since z is fully contained in y and x overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of y that overlaps with x doesn't overlap with z. In this case, x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Since z is fully contained in y, away from y's boundary, and x only partially overlaps with y, x and z might touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts. But actually, no. Since z is away from y's boundary and x partially overlaps with y, if x and z were to touch, they would share interior parts, not just boundary points. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since z is fully contained in y and x overlaps with y, it's possible that x and z have a common part, and this is the part of x that overlaps with y. At the same time, it's also possible that parts of x are outside of y (and hence outside of z), and parts of z are in y but not in x. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, all of x would need to be contained in z, and x would need to touch the boundary of z. But given the constraints, it's not possible for all of x to be contained in z because x has parts outside of y (since PO(x,y)), and z is fully contained in y. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similarly, given the constraints, it's not possible for all of x to be contained in z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, all of z would need to be contained in x, and z would need to touch the boundary of x. Since z is fully contained in y and x overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of y that overlaps with x fully contains z. And if z touches the boundary of that overlapping part, it would touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similarly, it's possible that the part of y that overlaps with x fully contains z, and z is away from the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. But given that x has parts outside of y (since PO(x,y)) and z is fully contained in y, x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check the EC case. EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. Now, z is entirely contained in y, away from y's boundary, so z has a distance from y's boundary. If the overlapping part of x in y doesn't intersect with z, then x and z would be disconnected, which is the DC case. But if the overlapping part of x in y does reach z, then they would have overlapping interior parts, which would make it a PO, TPPi, or NTPPi case. It doesn't seem possible for x and z to touch only at their boundaries, given the constraints.

So I'll confirm that EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Let's quickly check each of the relations DC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi to ensure they're consistent with the constraints.

DC(x,z): z is entirely in y. x partially overlaps with y. If the part of y that overlaps with x doesn't intersect with z, then x and z would be disconnected.
PO(x,z): z is entirely in y. x partially overlaps with y. If z intersects with the overlapping part of x and y, but z also extends into parts of y that don't overlap with x, and x extends outside of y (and hence outside of z), then x and z would partially overlap.
TPPi(x,z): z is entirely in y. x partially overlaps with y. If z is entirely contained in the overlapping part of x and y, and z touches the boundary of that overlapping part, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(x,z): z is entirely in y. x partially overlaps with y. If z is entirely contained in the overlapping part of x and y, away from the boundary of that overlapping part, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

These seem consistent with the constraints.

However, the boundary of the overlapping part (o) of x and y isn't necessarily the same as the boundary of x. The boundary of x where it lies within y is part of the boundary of o, but the boundary of x where it lies outside of y isn't the boundary of o.

Let's step back. Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and x and y partially overlap, we've established the following possible relations between x and z:

DC(x,z): This is possible if z doesn't intersect with the overlapping part of x and y.
PO(x,z): This is possible if z intersects with the overlapping part of x and y, but z also extends into parts of y that don't overlap with x, and x extends outside of y.

But I'm skeptical about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) now. Let's revisit them:

TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z is away from the boundary of y. So, z couldn't touch the boundary of x where x and y overlap. But z could potentially touch the boundary of x where it lies within y.

Let me think more about this. Imagine a scenario where x extends beyond y. The part of x inside y might fully contain z, and z might touch the boundary of x (but not the boundary of y, since z is a non-tangential proper part of y). In this case, TPPi(x,z) would be a possible relationship.

NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained in x, away from the boundary of x. This seems possible if the overlapping part of x and y fully contains z, and z is away from the boundary of that overlapping part.

So, the possible relationships remain: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, one more thing to check with regard to TPPi(x,z). If TPPi(x,z) is true, then z is tangential to x's boundary. But z is within y, away from y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)). So the only way for z to touch the boundary of x would be at a point where the boundary of x is within y, not at the boundary of y. This could happen if the part of x inside y creates a kind of "notch" or "dent" in the overlapping region, and z touches that notch.

Actually, I think we're overthinking this. Let's focus on the relationship between the overlapping part of x and y (let's call it 'o') and z.

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, we know that z is entirely within y, away from y's boundary.

The region o is a part of both x and y. Now, there are several possibilities for how z relates to o:

1. z doesn't intersect with o at all. In this case, x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) would be true.
2. z intersects with o, but z isn't entirely contained in o. In this case, x and z would partially overlap, so PO(x,z) would be true.
3. z is entirely contained in o. In this case, z would be a part of x. Since o is only a part of x, and the boundary of o within y isn't necessarily the boundary of x, z could either touch or not touch the boundary of x. If it touches, TPPi(x,z) would be true. If it doesn't, NTPPi(x,z) would be true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I'll double check again...

We're looking at:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- NTPPi(y,z) (which is the same as NTPP(z,y)): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. z is fully contained within y, away from y's boundary.

And we're trying to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's see if we can systematically determine which relationships are possible based on the constraints. I'll check each relationship:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. Given that z is fully contained in y and x overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of y that overlaps with x doesn't intersect with z. In this case, x and z would be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Since z is fully contained in y, away from y's boundary, and x overlaps with y, if x and z were to touch, they would share interior parts, not just boundary points. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. Since z is fully contained in y and x overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of y that overlaps with x also partially overlaps with z. In this case, x and z would share a spatial part. And since x has parts outside of y (since PO(x,y)) and z is fully contained in y, x would not be fully contained in z. Similarly, if z is not fully contained in the overlapping part of x and y, then z would not be fully contained in x. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, all of x would need to be contained in z, and x would need to touch the boundary of z. But given that x has parts outside of y (since PO(x,y)) and z is fully contained in y, it's not possible for all of x to be contained in z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similarly, given that x has parts outside of y (since PO(x,y)) and z is fully contained in y, it's not possible for all of x to be contained in z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, all of z would need to be contained in x, and z would need to touch the boundary of x. Since z is fully contained in y and x overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of y that overlaps with x fully contains z. And since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z doesn't touch the boundary of y. But it could touch the boundary of x where the boundary of x is inside y. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, all of z would need to be contained in x, away from the boundary of x. Since z is fully contained in y and x overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of y that overlaps with x fully contains z. And if z is away from the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) would be true. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the same space. But given that x has parts outside of y (since PO(x,y)) and z is fully contained in y, it's not possible for x and z to occupy the same space. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z based on the constraints are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Now, I'm going to recheck TPPi(x,z). For this to be true, z must be entirely within x, and z must touch the boundary of x. Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z is entirely within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. 

Now, the overlapping part of x and y is a region that belongs to both x and y. If z is entirely within this overlapping region, then z is entirely within x.

But for TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must also touch the boundary of x. 

One scenario I can think of: Imagine x forms a kind of "bay" or "gulf" within y. The boundary of this bay is the boundary of x (not the boundary of y). If z is positioned such that it touches this bay's boundary, then z would be touching the boundary of x while still being a non-tangential proper part of y. Hence, TPPi(x,z) would be possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z remain:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I think we've exhaustively explored the possibilities, so these are the possible relationships between x and z.

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), I'll analyze what these conditions tell us:

- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some region without either containing the other
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, there are four possible configurations:

1. DC(x,z): If z is entirely within the portion of y that doesn't overlap with x, then x and z are disconnected.

2. PO(x,z): If z partially falls within the overlapping region of x and y, and partially in the region of y that doesn't overlap with x, then x and z partially overlap.

3. TPPi(x,z): If z is completely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, and touches the boundary of this overlapping region (from inside y), then z is a tangential proper part of x.

4. NTPPi(x,z): If z is completely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, and doesn't touch the boundary of this overlapping region, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
