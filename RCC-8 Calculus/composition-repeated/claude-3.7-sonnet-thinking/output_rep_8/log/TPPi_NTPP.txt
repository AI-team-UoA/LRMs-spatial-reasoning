PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We have two relations:
- TPPi(x, y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y, z): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, z contains y completely in its interior, with no part of y touching the boundary of z.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z.

Since TPPi(x, y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

Since NTPP(y, z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But this is impossible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the region y.

2. EC(x, z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But since y is in both x and z, they do share interior points. So EC(x, z) is impossible.

3. PO(x, z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible. If x extends beyond z in some areas and z extends beyond x in others, then they partially overlap.

4. TPP(x, z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x, z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within the interior of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x, z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that NTPP(y, z), and y is part of x, it's not immediately clear if this is possible. But we'll check further.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that NTPP(y, z), and y is part of x, it's not immediately clear if this is possible. But we'll check further.

8. EQ(x, z): This would mean x and z are identical. Given that NTPP(y, z), and TPPi(x, y), it's not immediately clear if this is possible. But we'll check further.

Let's investigate options 6, 7, and 8 more carefully:

6. TPPi(x, z): 
   - TPPi(x, z) means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - We know that NTPP(y, z), which means y is inside z. 
   - We also know that TPPi(x, y), which means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - If z is a proper part of x, and y is inside z, then y would be inside x. This is consistent with TPPi(x, y).
   - But if y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z (not touching the boundary of z due to NTPP(y, z)), then z must also touch the boundary of x to accommodate this.
   - So, TPPi(x, z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): 
   - NTPPi(x, z) means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
   - Given that y is inside z and y touches the boundary of x, it seems contradictory that z, which contains y, doesn't touch the boundary of x.
   - So, NTPPi(x, z) seems impossible.

8. EQ(x, z): 
   - EQ(x, z) means x and z are identical.
   - We know that y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x, y)), and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y, z)).
   - If x and z are identical, then the same region can't have different relationships with y.
   - So, EQ(x, z) is impossible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning for NTPPi(x, z). Let me re-examine it.

7. NTPPi(x, z): 
   - NTPPi(x, z) means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
   - Given NTPP(y, z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - If z is completely inside x (not touching the boundary of x), and y is inside z (not touching the boundary of z), then y would be inside x and wouldn't touch the boundary of x.
   - But this contradicts TPPi(x, y), which says y touches the boundary of x.
   - So, NTPPi(x, z) is indeed impossible.

Actually I'm making a silly mistake in thinking about (7) NTPPi(x, z). Let's go through it again:

TPPi(x, y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPP(y, z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's draw this.
x = a big circle
y = a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary
z = a circle that completely contains y, such that y doesn't touch z's boundary

Now, consider NTPPi(x, z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
Given the setup I just described, is it possible for z to be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary?
z contains y completely, and y touches x's boundary. Therefore, z must also touch x's boundary (in fact, z must extend beyond y at the point where y touches x's boundary).
So, z can't be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, NTPPi(x, z) is indeed impossible.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)

Actually, let me re-check all of the options once more, to make sure I've not made a mistake:

1. DC(x, z): Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z share at least the region y.

2. EC(x, z): Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z share interior points and don't just touch at the boundary.

3. PO(x, z): 
   - PO(x, z) means x and z partially overlap, with neither being a proper part of the other.
   - Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - Given NTPP(y, z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - If parts of x are outside z and parts of z are outside x, then they partially overlap.
   - This is consistent with both TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z).
   - So, PO(x, z) is possible.

4. TPP(x, z): 
   - TPP(x, z) means x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.
   - Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - Given NTPP(y, z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - If x is inside z and touches the boundary of z, then y (which is inside x) would be inside z. This is consistent with NTPP(y, z).
   - But if y touches the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, then y could potentially be close to the boundary of z.
   - However, NTPP(y, z) stipulates that y doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means that even though x touches the boundary of z, y must be situated such that it's not at those points of contact.
   - This is a possible configuration.
   - So, TPP(x, z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x, z): 
   - NTPP(x, z) means x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - Given NTPP(y, z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - If x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z and wouldn't touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with NTPP(y, z).
   - So, NTPP(x, z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x, z): 
   - TPPi(x, z) means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - Given NTPP(y, z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - If z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then y is inside x. This is consistent with TPPi(x, y).
   - But if y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x, y)), and y is completely inside z without touching its boundary (from NTPP(y, z)), then z must extend beyond y at the point where y touches the boundary of x.
   - This would mean z also touches the boundary of x at that point.
   - So, TPPi(x, z) is possible.

Actually, I think there's a contradiction in the TPPi(x, z) reasoning. Let me check:
- TPPi(x, z) means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- We have TPPi(x, y), meaning y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- We also have NTPP(y, z), meaning y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- If z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z without touching its boundary, then y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. That's consistent with NTPP(y, z).
- But if y is supposed to touch the boundary of x (as per TPPi(x, y)), and y is completely inside z without touching its boundary, then z must extend beyond y at the point where y touches the boundary of x. This would mean z extends up to the boundary of x at that point.
- This is still consistent with TPPi(x, z), which requires z to touch the boundary of x.

Hmm, let's try drawing it:
- x = a big circle
- z = a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary
- y = an even smaller circle inside z, but positioned such that it's touching the boundary of x at the same point where z touches the boundary of x.

But this doesn't work because if y touches the boundary of x, and it's inside z, then y must also touch the boundary of z. But NTPP(y, z) says y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Maybe I should try a different configuration:
- x = a big circle
- z = a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary
- y = an even smaller circle inside z, touching the boundary of x at a different point from where z touches the boundary of x.

But this doesn't work either because if y is inside z, and y touches the boundary of x, then z must also touch the boundary of x at that point.

Actually, let me reason about this more carefully. The key is the relationship between y and the boundaries of x and z.

TPPi(x, y) means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
NTPP(y, z) means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x, y)) and y is inside z without touching its boundary (from NTPP(y, z)), then z must extend beyond y at the point where y touches the boundary of x. This means z extends up to and potentially beyond the boundary of x at that point.

There are two possibilities:
1. z extends up to the boundary of x but doesn't cross it. In this case, z touches the boundary of x.
2. z extends beyond the boundary of x. In this case, z and x partially overlap, with some parts of z outside of x.

The first case corresponds to TPPi(x, z), and the second case corresponds to PO(x, z).

But there's a contradiction in the first case. If z touches the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of x at the same point, and y is inside z, then y must also touch the boundary of z at that point. But NTPP(y, z) says y doesn't touch the boundary of z. 
Actually, wait, let's see if I can draw this.

x = a big circle
z = a smaller circle
y = an even smaller circle

If TPPi(x, y), then y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
If NTPP(y, z), then y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x, z))? For this to be true, z must be inside x and touch the boundary of x.

OK, I see the problem with my reasoning. Let's say z touches the boundary of x. Then y is inside z. But if y also touches the boundary of x, the only way this can happen is if y touches the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of x. But that contradicts NTPP(y, z), which says y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, TPPi(x, z) is not a possible relationship between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z).

7. NTPPi(x, z): 
   - NTPPi(x, z) means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
   - Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - Given NTPP(y, z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - If z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then y is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
   - But this contradicts TPPi(x, y), which says y touches the boundary of x.
   - So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): 
   - EQ(x, z) means x and z are identical.
   - Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
   - Given NTPP(y, z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - If x and z are identical, then the relationship between y and x should be the same as the relationship between y and z.
   - But TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) describe different relationships.
   - So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

Alright, based on my reasoning, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

I re-checked TPPi(x, z) and found that it's not possible, so I'm removing it from the list.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake about TPPi(x, z) but in the opposite direction now. Let me try to think about it again.

For TPPi(x, z), we would have z as a proper part of x, with z touching the boundary of x.

Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
Given NTPP(y, z), y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

OK, let's reason about this:

1. NTPP(y, z) implies that y is contained fully within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
2. TPPi(x, y) implies that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

Given these, can TPPi(x, z) be true? Can z be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x?

OK, let's see. z contains y, and y touches the boundary of x. So, z must also extend up to the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. But if z extends right up to the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then y would touch the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of x. But this contradicts NTPP(y, z), which says y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So it seems TPPi(x, z) is indeed not possible.

Now, let's try PO(x, z):

For PO(x, z), x and z would partially overlap, with neither being a proper part of the other.

Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
Given NTPP(y, z), y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

OK, let's reason about this:

1. NTPP(y, z) implies that y is contained fully within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
2. TPPi(x, y) implies that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

Given these, can PO(x, z) be true? Can x and z partially overlap?

Let's see. y is inside both x and z, so x and z definitely overlap. But for PO(x, z), neither can be a proper part of the other.

If TPPi(x, y), then y touches the boundary of x. But if NTPP(y, z), then y doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means that y is more "central" in z than it is in x. Extrapolating from this, z could potentially extend beyond the boundary of x in some areas, making PO(x, z) a possibility.

So, PO(x, z) seems possible.

For TPP(x, z), x would be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z.

Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
Given NTPP(y, z), y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's reason about this:

1. NTPP(y, z) implies that y is contained fully within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
2. TPPi(x, y) implies that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

Given these, can TPP(x, z) be true? Can x be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z?

If y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x must extend beyond y at the point where y touches the boundary of x. But this means x could potentially touch the boundary of z, making TPP(x, z) a possibility.

So, TPP(x, z) seems possible.

For NTPP(x, z), x would be a proper part of z and not touch the boundary of z.

Given TPPi(x, y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
Given NTPP(y, z), y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's reason about this:

1. NTPP(y, z) implies that y is contained fully within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
2. TPPi(x, y) implies that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

Given these, can NTPP(x, z) be true? Can x be a proper part of z and not touch the boundary of z?

Hang on. Let's think about this: we're asking whether we can have NTPP(x, z), which means all of x is inside z, without touching z's boundary. But we know TPPi(x, y), which means y is in x and y touches x's boundary. And we know NTPP(y, z), which means y is in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

OK, if y is in x and touching x's boundary, and y is also in z and not touching z's boundary, then it's not possible for all of x to be in z without touching z's boundary.

So NTPP(x, z) is not a possible relationship.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused again about this, so let me try to draw this out differently.

* x = a big circle
* y = a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x. This confirms TPPi(x, y).
* z = a circle that fully contains y without y touching the boundary of z. This confirms NTPP(y, z).

Now, the question is, what is the relationship between x and z?

Can x be inside z and touch the boundary of z (TPP(x, z))? I said this is possible. But let's think about it. If y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z without touching the boundary of z, then x extends right up to the boundary of z. But if x touches the boundary of z at any point, then parts of x that are close to the boundary of z (like the part that y is touching) would mean y is close to the boundary of z. But NTPP(y, z) says y doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, there needs to be a buffer space between y and the boundary of z. But if x touches the boundary of z, then this buffer space doesn't exist. So, TPP(x, z) may not be possible.

Actually, I think it depends on how y is situated inside x and how z is situated around y. Let me try to construct a specific scenario.

x = a big circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 2.
y = a smaller circle with its center at (1.5, 0) and radius 0.5. This way, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at (2, 0).
z = a circle with its center at (1, 0) and radius 1.25. This way, z fully contains y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z (the distance from the center of y to the center of z is 0.5, and the radius of z is 1.25, so y is fully inside z).

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

The distance between the centers of x and z is 1. The sum of their radii is 2 + 1.25 = 3.25, which is greater than the distance between their centers. So, x and z overlap.

But is one a proper part of the other? The distance from the center of x to the boundary of z (at the farthest point from x) is 1 + 1.25 = 2.25, which is greater than the radius of x. So, z isn't fully inside x.

Similarly, the distance from the center of z to the boundary of x (at the farthest point from z) is 1 + 2 = 3, which is greater than the radius of z. So, x isn't fully inside z.

So, in this scenario, x and z partially overlap (PO(x, z)).

Let me try a different scenario to see if TPP(x, z) is possible:

x = a big circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 2.
y = a smaller circle with its center at (1.5, 0) and radius 0.5. This way, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at (2, 0).
z = a much bigger circle with its center at (-1, 0) and radius 4. 

Now, z fully contains x because the distance from the center of z to the farthest point of x is 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than the radius of z.

Furthermore, x touches the boundary of z at (-2, 0) because the distance from the center of x to that point is 2, which is exactly the radius of x.

So, in this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x, z)).

Now, we have to check if NTPP(y, z) holds in this scenario. The distance from the center of y to the center of z is 2.5. The radius of z is 4, so the boundary of z from the center of y is at a distance of 4 - 2.5 = 1.5. The radius of y is 0.5, so y is definitely not touching the boundary of z (since 0.5 < 1.5).

So, in this scenario, TPP(x, z) and all the given conditions are met.

So, based on these examples, both PO(x, z) and TPP(x, z) are possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z).

Let me also check if NTPP(x, z) is possible.

I initially claimed it wasn't possible, but I'm not confident in that assessment. Let me construct a specific scenario:

x = a circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 1.
y = a smaller circle with its center at (0.9, 0) and radius 0.1. This way, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at (1, 0).
z = a much bigger circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 3.

Now, z fully contains x because the distance from the center of z to the farthest point of x is 1, which is less than the radius of z.

Furthermore, x is not touching the boundary of z because the distance from the boundary of z to the center of x is 3, which is greater than the radius of x.

So, in this scenario, x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x, z)).

Now, we have to check if NTPP(y, z) holds in this scenario. The distance from the center of y to the center of z is 0.9. The radius of z is 3, so the boundary of z from the center of y is at a distance of 3 - 0.9 = 2.1. The radius of y is 0.1, so y is definitely not touching the boundary of z (since 0.1 < 2.1).

Wait, I see a problem with this. In this scenario, the circle y is centered at (0.9, 0) with a radius of 0.1. The circle x is centered at (0, 0) with a radius of 1. The point (1, 0) is at the boundary of x. The distance from the center of y to this point is 0.1, which is exactly the radius of y. So, y touches the boundary of x at (1, 0). This satisfies TPPi(x, y).

The circle z is centered at (0, 0) with a radius of 3. The distance from the center of y to the center of z is 0.9. The boundary of z is at a distance of 3 from its center, so the distance from the center of y to the boundary of z is 3 - 0.9 = 2.1. The radius of y is 0.1, so the distance from the boundary of y to the boundary of z is 2.1 - 0.1 = 2. Since this is greater than 0, y doesn't touch the boundary of z, which satisfies NTPP(y, z).

Also, the circle x is centered at (0, 0) with a radius of 1. The distance from the center of x to the center of z is 0. The boundary of z is at a distance of 3 from its center, so the distance from the center of x to the boundary of z is 3. The radius of x is 1, so the distance from the boundary of x to the boundary of z is 3 - 1 = 2. Since this is greater than 0, x doesn't touch the boundary of z, which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x, z)).

So, in this scenario, NTPP(x, z) and all the given conditions are met.

So, based on my analyses, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

Let me check if I'm missing anything or if any of the other relations could be possible.

If DC(x, z), then x and z are disconnected. Given that y is part of both x and z, this is not possible.

If EC(x, z), then x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that y is inside both x and z, this is not possible.

If TPPi(x, z), then z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. If z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then y would touch the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of x. But NTPP(y, z) says y doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

If NTPPi(x, z), then z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. If z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then y wouldn't touch the boundary of x. But TPPi(x, y) says y touches the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

If EQ(x, z), then x and z are identical. If x and z are identical, then the relationship between y and x should be the same as the relationship between y and z. But TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) describe different relationships. So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

Actually, wait. Let me just try to make sure that TPP(x, z) is possible by constructing a specific example.

In the scenario I created earlier:
x = a big circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 2.
y = a smaller circle with its center at (1.5, 0) and radius 0.5. This way, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at (2, 0).
z = a much bigger circle with its center at (-1, 0) and radius 4.

I claimed that x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x, z)). Let me check this.

The distance from the center of x to the center of z is 1. The sum of their radii is 2 + 4 = 6, which is greater than the distance between their centers. So, x and z overlap.

The radius of z is 4, and the distance from the center of z to the farthest point of x is 1 + 2 = 3. Since 3 < 4, z fully contains x.

So, x is a proper part of z.

Now, we need to check if x touches the boundary of z. The distance from the center of x to the center of z is 1. The radius of z is 4, so the boundary of z from the center of x is at a distance of 4 - 1 = 3. The radius of x is 2, so the distance from the boundary of x to the boundary of z is 3 - 2 = 1. Since this is greater than 0, x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, in this scenario, x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x, z)), not a tangential proper part.

I made a mistake in my original analysis.

Let me construct a new scenario to check if TPP(x, z) is possible:

x = a circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 2.
y = a smaller circle with its center at (1, 0) and radius 1. This way, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at (2, 0).
z = a circle with its center at (2, 0) and radius 4.

Now, let's check if TPPi(x, y) holds. The distance from the center of x to the center of y is 1. The radius of x is 2, and the radius of y is 1. So, y is inside x. The distance from the center of y to the boundary of x (specifically, to the point (2, 0)) is 1, which is exactly the radius of y. So, y touches the boundary of x. This satisfies TPPi(x, y).

Next, let's check if NTPP(y, z) holds. The distance from the center of y to the center of z is 1. The radius of z is 4, so the boundary of z from the center of y is at a distance of 4 - 1 = 3. The radius of y is 1, so the distance from the boundary of y to the boundary of z is 3 - 1 = 2. Since this is greater than 0, y doesn't touch the boundary of z. This satisfies NTPP(y, z).

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z. The distance from the center of x to the center of z is 2. The sum of their radii is 2 + 4 = 6, which is greater than the distance between their centers. So, x and z overlap.

The radius of z is 4, and the distance from the center of z to the farthest point of x is 2 + 2 = 4. Since 4 = 4, x touches the boundary of z.

So, in this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x, z)).

Given these checks, TPP(x, z) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z).

Now, let's check if NTPP(x, z) is possible using the scenario I constructed earlier:

x = a circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 1.
y = a smaller circle with its center at (0.9, 0) and radius 0.1. This way, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at (1, 0).
z = a much bigger circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 3.

I've already verified that TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) hold in this scenario. Also, x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x, z)).

So, NTPP(x, z) is a possible relationship between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z).

Lastly, let's check if PO(x, z) is possible using the scenario I constructed earlier:

x = a big circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 2.
y = a smaller circle with its center at (1.5, 0) and radius 0.5. This way, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at (2, 0).
z = a circle with its center at (1, 0) and radius 1.25. This way, z fully contains y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z (the distance from the center of y to the center of z is 0.5, and the radius of z is 1.25, so y is fully inside z).

Let's check if TPPi(x, y) holds. The distance from the center of x to the center of y is 1.5. The radius of x is 2, and the radius of y is 0.5. So, y is inside x. The distance from the center of y to the boundary of x (specifically, to the point (2, 0)) is 0.5, which is exactly the radius of y. So, y touches the boundary of x. This satisfies TPPi(x, y).

Next, let's check if NTPP(y, z) holds. The distance from the center of y to the center of z is 0.5. The radius of z is 1.25, so the boundary of z from the center of y is at a distance of 1.25 - 0.5 = 0.75. The radius of y is 0.5, so the distance from the boundary of y to the boundary of z is 0.75 - 0.5 = 0.25. Since this is greater than 0, y doesn't touch the boundary of z. This satisfies NTPP(y, z).

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z. The distance from the center of x to the center of z is 1. The sum of their radii is 2 + 1.25 = 3.25, which is greater than the distance between their centers. So, x and z overlap.

But is one a proper part of the other? The distance from the center of x to the boundary of z (at the farthest point from x) is 1 + 1.25 = 2.25, which is greater than the radius of x. So, z isn't fully inside x.

Similarly, the distance from the center of z to the boundary of x (at the farthest point from z) is 1 + 2 = 3, which is greater than the radius of z. So, x isn't fully inside z.

So, in this scenario, x and z partially overlap (PO(x, z)).

Given these checks, PO(x, z) is a possible relationship between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

This means x and z can be related in one of these three ways: they can partially overlap (PO), x can be a tangential proper part of z (TPP), or x can be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the region y.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y in their intersection. Since y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, this arrangement is consistent.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be contained within z and touch z's boundary, while y touches x's boundary but stays away from z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, while y touches x's boundary but stays away from z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z were a tangential proper part of x, and y touches x's boundary while being inside z, then y would have to touch z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z were contained within x without touching x's boundary, then y (which is inside z) couldn't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z were identical, y couldn't simultaneously touch x's boundary (TPPi(x,y)) and not touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
