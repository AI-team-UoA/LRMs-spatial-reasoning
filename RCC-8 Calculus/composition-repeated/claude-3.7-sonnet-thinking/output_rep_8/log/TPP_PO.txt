PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step by step.

We know that:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely contained in y, and x touches y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z. This means y and z share some common region, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Now I need to determine what possible relationships can hold between x and z.

First, let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at boundary)
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

Now, let's determine which of these are possible given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Since TPP(x,y), x is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary. Since PO(y,z), y and z share some common region, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Since x is completely inside y, and y overlaps with z, it's possible that x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. In this case, x and z would be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Since x touches y's boundary and y overlaps with z, it's possible that x touches z exactly at the boundary without sharing any interior points. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Since x is inside y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x also partially overlaps with z (part of x is in the overlap region of y and z, and part is outside z). So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): It's possible that x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary. This would happen if the part of y containing x is completely inside z, and x touches the boundary of z at the same points it touches the boundary of y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): It's possible that x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This would happen if the part of y containing x is completely inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But since x is a proper part of y, x cannot contain z (which overlaps with y but is not contained in y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, since x is a proper part of y, x cannot contain z. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But since x is a proper part of y and z is not a proper part of y (it partially overlaps with y), x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, let me double-check each of these possibilities more carefully by drawing some examples:

1. DC(x,z): 
   y and z partially overlap, and x is a tangential proper part of y. If x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z are disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   y and z partially overlap, and x is a tangential proper part of y. If x touches the boundary of y exactly where y touches z, then x and z can be externally connected. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   y and z partially overlap, and x is a tangential proper part of y. If x overlaps with the intersection of y and z, but also extends into the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z):
   If x is completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, and x touches the boundary of z (which could happen if x touches the boundary of y at a point where y and z meet), then x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z (which could happen if x touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't meet z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible.

So my final list of possible relations between x and z given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm not completely sure about NTPP(x,z). Let me think about it again. 

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, so x touches the boundary of y. 
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and not touching the boundary of z. But since x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)), can x be completely inside z without touching its boundary?

Let's consider: if x touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't meet z, then x can't be inside z at all (since z doesn't extend to that point). But if x touches y's boundary at a point where y and z overlap, then x might also touch z's boundary at that point.

However, it's also possible that the boundary of z in the overlapping region is different from the boundary of y. So it could be that x touches y's boundary but is completely interior to z.

Yes, I think NTPP(x,z) is possible. If x is completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, and the part of y's boundary that x touches is inside z (not on z's boundary), then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

So my final list of possible relations between x and z given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to analyze the possible spatial configurations when we have TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely contained within y
- x touches y's boundary

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z share some spatial part
- Neither y nor z is contained within the other

Given these constraints, let me determine all possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x could be in the portion of y that doesn't overlap with z at all
2. EC(x,z): x could touch z's boundary without sharing interior points
3. PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z
4. TPP(x,z): x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because x cannot contain z (since x is completely within y, but z is not completely within y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
