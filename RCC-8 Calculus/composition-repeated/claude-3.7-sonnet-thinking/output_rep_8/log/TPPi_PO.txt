PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze this. I need to determine what are the possible RCC-8 relationships between regions x and z, given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): This means that y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

I need to consider all possibilities for how x and z might relate given these constraints. Let me visualize and reason through this step by step.

First, let's recall what we know:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary (TPPi(x,y))
- y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z))

Since y touches the boundary of x, and z overlaps with y, there are several possibilities for how z relates to x:

1. z could be completely outside x except for the part that overlaps with y (so z and x share exactly the part that's in y). This would make DC(x,z) impossible since they share at least some part through y. 

2. z could be partially inside x (the part that overlaps with y) and partially outside x. This would be PO(x,z).

3. z could be completely inside x, but not touching x's boundary. This would be NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

4. z could be completely inside x and touching x's boundary. This would be TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

5. z could be identical to x, but this seems impossible given that z partially overlaps with y, and y is a proper part of x.

6. z could be equal to y, which would make TPP(z,x) since y is a tangential proper part of x.

7. z could completely contain x, which seems impossible given the constraints.

Let me reason through each RCC-8 relation to see if it's possible:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because y is part of x and y overlaps with z, so x and z must share at least the part where y and z overlap.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z only touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This seems impossible for the same reason - y overlaps with z and is part of x, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible - z could overlap with a part of y that's inside x, and also extend beyond x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible - z could completely contain x and touch x's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible - z could completely contain x without touching x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible - z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible - z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This seems impossible because z partially overlaps with y, which is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x.

Wait, I think I missed something in my reasoning. Let me be more careful. 

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps with z

Let's reconsider each relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because y overlaps with z and y is part of x, so x and z must share at least that overlapping part.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries. This is impossible for the same reason - y overlaps with z and is part of x, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. For example, if z partially extends outside of x but also has some overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. For example, if z completely contains x and touches x's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. For example, if z completely contains x without touching x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. For example, if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. For example, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x equals z. This seems impossible because z partially overlaps with y, which is a proper part of x.

But wait, I should be more careful about TPP(x,z). If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x must be completely contained in z. But we know that y is completely contained in x and y partially overlaps with z. If part of y is outside z, that would mean part of x is outside z, which contradicts TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) might not be possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is completely contained in z without touching z's boundary, then y must also be completely contained in z since y is contained in x. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap, neither being contained in the other.

Let me reconsider more carefully:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps with z

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Impossible because y overlaps with z and y is part of x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries. Impossible because y overlaps with z and y is part of x, so they share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is definitely possible. For example, if z extends outside of x but also overlaps with y inside x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. I previously said this is possible, but let me check again. If x is completely contained in z, then y is also completely contained in z (since y is contained in x). But this contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap, neither being contained in the other. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. By the same reasoning as for TPP(x,z), this is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x equals z. This is impossible because z partially overlaps with y, which is a proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, I'm not feeling confident. Let me just double-check by reasoning through the entire problem again:

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps with z

Let's be very careful about what these mean:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This means y is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z) means y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other. So there's a part of y not in z, and a part of z not in y.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because y overlaps with z and y is part of x, so x and z must share at least that overlapping part.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries. This is impossible for the same reason as DC - y overlaps with z and is part of x, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means x and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other. 

   Is this possible? Yes. Since y is entirely within x and y partially overlaps with z, z must at least partially overlap with x. Also, since PO(y,z) means there's a part of y not in z, and y is entirely within x, there's a part of x (containing that part of y) not in z. Also, since PO(y,z) means there's a part of z not in y, that part of z could either be inside or outside x. If it's outside x, then there's a part of z not in x, confirming PO(x,z). Even if it's inside x, as long as there's another part of z outside x, we have PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

   Is this possible? No. Since y is entirely within x and PO(y,z) means there's a part of y not in z, there must be a part of x (containing that part of y) not in z. So x cannot be entirely contained within z, ruling out TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

   Is this possible? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z). Since there's a part of y not in z, and y is entirely within x, there must be a part of x not in z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

   Is this possible? Yes. Since y is a tangential proper part of x and partially overlaps with z, z could be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

   Is this possible? Yes. Since y is entirely within x and partially overlaps with z, z could be entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x equals z. This means x and z are the same region.

   Is this possible? No. Since y is a proper part of x and PO(y,z) means there's a part of z not in y, there must be a part of z not in y. But if x and z were the same, then there would be a part of x not in y, which contradicts the fact that y is a proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, there's a potential issue with my logic for TPPi(x,z). If z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary, then we need to ensure that this is consistent with PO(y,z). Since y also touches x's boundary (given TPPi(x,y)), it's possible that y and z don't overlap as much as needed for PO(y,z).

Let me re-examine:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.

For TPPi(x,z) to be possible, z must be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary. For PO(y,z) to be true, y and z must share some region, but neither can be completely contained in the other.

So, for both conditions to be satisfied, z must be entirely within x, touch x's boundary, overlap with y, but neither y nor z can be completely contained in the other.

Is this possible? Yes, I believe so. For example, imagine y and z as two circles inside x, both touching the boundary of x, and partially overlapping with each other.

What about NTPPi(x,z)? For this to be true, z must be entirely contained within x and not touch x's boundary. For PO(y,z) to be true, y and z must share some region, but neither can be completely contained in the other.

Is this possible? Yes. Imagine z as a circle entirely within x, not touching x's boundary, and partially overlapping with y.

So, my conclusion remains:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I just realized a flaw in my reasoning about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). I said these are impossible because there must be a part of x not in z, but that's not necessarily true. Let me reconsider:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.

For TPP(x,z) to be possible, x must be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary. For PO(y,z) to be true, y and z must share some region, but neither can be completely contained in the other.

Can both conditions be satisfied? Let's see... If x is entirely contained within z, then y is also entirely contained within z (since y is contained in x). But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that there's a part of y not in z. So TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then y is also entirely contained within z. Again, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is also impossible.

What about EQ(x,z)? If x and z are the same region, then y is entirely contained within z. This again contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, my conclusion is still:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I want to make sure that TPPi(x,z) can simultaneously satisfy both TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), and similarly for NTPPi(x,z). Let me draw it out in more detail:

For TPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x

Can all three be true simultaneously? For TPPi(x,z), z must be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary. For PO(y,z), y and z must share some region, but neither can be completely contained in the other. And for TPPi(x,y), y must be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary.

Picture: x is a big circle. y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point. z is another smaller circle inside x, also touching x's boundary at a different point. y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.

I believe this configuration satisfies all three relations. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Can all three be true simultaneously? For NTPPi(x,z), z must be entirely contained within x and not touch x's boundary. For PO(y,z), y and z must share some region, but neither can be completely contained in the other. And for TPPi(x,y), y must be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary.

Picture: x is a big circle. y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point. z is another smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary. y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.

I believe this configuration also satisfies all three relations. So NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

Let me see if there's another relationship to consider.

Oh, let's just double-check DC(x,z) and EC(x,z):

For DC(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.

Can all three be true simultaneously? For DC(x,z), x and z must not share any region. But for PO(y,z), y and z must share some region. Since y is a part of x, if y and z share a region, then x and z must also share that region. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

For EC(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries.

Can all three be true simultaneously? For EC(x,z), x and z must only touch at their boundaries, not sharing any interior points. But for PO(y,z), y and z must share some interior region. Since y is inside x, if y and z share an interior region, then x and z must also share that interior region. This contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is impossible.

So, my conclusion remains:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check if the relation EQ(x,z) is possible:

For EQ(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

Can all three be true simultaneously? For EQ(x,z), x and z must be the same region. For TPPi(x,y), y must be a proper part of x, meaning y is entirely contained within x. For PO(y,z), y and z must share some region, but neither can be completely contained in the other.

If x and z are the same region, and y is entirely contained within x, then y must also be entirely contained within z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that y is not entirely contained within z. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, my conclusion is still:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

To make sure I've been thorough, let's also check if TPP(x,z) is possible:

For TPP(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.

Can all three be true simultaneously? For TPP(x,z), x must be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary. For TPPi(x,y), y must be entirely contained within x. For PO(y,z), y and z must share some region, but neither can be completely contained in the other.

If x is entirely contained within z, and y is entirely contained within x, then y must also be entirely contained within z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that y is not entirely contained within z. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z):

For NTPP(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Can all three be true simultaneously? For NTPP(x,z), x must be entirely contained within z and not touch z's boundary. For TPPi(x,y), y must be entirely contained within x. For PO(y,z), y and z must share some region, but neither can be completely contained in the other.

If x is entirely contained within z, and y is entirely contained within x, then y must also be entirely contained within z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that y is not entirely contained within z. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

So, my conclusion is still:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think I may have made a serious error in my understanding of the constraints. Let me re-check the PO relation:

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap, which means they share some region, but neither is a subset of the other. In other words, there's a part of y not in z, and a part of z not in y.

This is consistent with my earlier reasoning. So PO(y,z) means:
- y and z share some non-empty region.
- There is a part of y not in z.
- There is a part of z not in y.

Now, let's reconsider the relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because y overlaps with z and y is part of x, so x and z must share that overlapping region.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries. This is impossible for the same reason - y overlaps with z and is part of x, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means x and z share some region, but neither is a subset of the other. 

   Is this possible? Yes. Since y is entirely within x and y partially overlaps with z, x and z must share some region. Also, since y is entirely within x and there's a part of y not in z, there's a part of x not in z. And since there's a part of z not in y, that part of z could either be inside or outside x. If it's outside x, then there's a part of z not in x, confirming PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

   Is this possible? No. Since y is entirely within x and there's a part of y not in z (from PO(y,z)), there must be a part of x not in z. So x cannot be entirely contained within z, ruling out TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

   Is this possible? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

   Is this possible? Not necessarily. If z is entirely contained within x, then there can't be a part of z not in x. But from PO(y,z), there's a part of z not in y. If this part is outside x, then z is not entirely contained within x, contradicting TPPi(x,z). But if this part is inside x but outside y, then TPPi(x,z) could be possible.

   So, for TPPi(x,z) to be possible, the part of z not in y must be entirely within x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of x, this is definitely possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

   Is this possible? By the same reasoning as for TPPi(x,z), this is possible if the part of z not in y is entirely within x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x equals z. This means x and z are the same region.

   Is this possible? No. Since y is a proper part of x and there's a part of y not in z (from PO(y,z)), there must be a part of x not in z. So x and z cannot be the same region.

So, my conclusion is still:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Alright, I think I've been thorough in my analysis and have checked all possible relations.

Let me summarize once more:

- DC(x,z): Impossible because y overlaps with z and y is part of x.
- EC(x,z): Impossible because y overlaps with z and is part of x, so x and z share interior points.
- PO(x,z): Possible. x and z share the region where y and z overlap, and there can be parts of x not in z and parts of z not in x.
- TPP(x,z): Impossible because there's a part of x (containing part of y) not in z.
- NTPP(x,z): Impossible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
- TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely contained within x, touches x's boundary, and the part of z not in y is entirely within x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely contained within x, doesn't touch x's boundary, and the part of z not in y is entirely within x.
- EQ(x,z): Impossible because there's a part of x (containing part of y) not in z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm now very confident in this answer.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me verify my reasoning once more by drawing some pictures and seeing if they satisfy the given constraints:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, with neither being a subset of the other.

Let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Picture: x is a big circle. y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point. z is another circle that overlaps with y, extends outside y, and also extends outside x.
   In this picture, y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)), y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), and x and z partially overlap (PO(x,z)). So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Picture: x is a big circle. y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point. z is another smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a different point. z and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
   In this picture, y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)), y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), and z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Picture: x is a big circle. y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point. z is another smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary. z and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
   In this picture, y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)), y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), and z is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

4. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Is this possible? No. Since y is part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share that overlapping region.

5. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries.
   Is this possible? No. Since y is part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share interior points.

6. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? No. Since y is part of x and there's a part of y not in z (from PO(y,z)), there must be a part of x not in z. So x cannot be entirely contained within z.

7. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   Is this possible? No. Since y is a proper part of x and there's a part of y not in z (from PO(y,z)), there must be a part of x not in z. So x and z cannot be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

This is consistent with my previous conclusion, so I'm confident it's correct.

Actually wait, there's an issue with my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider:

For TPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, with neither being a subset of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary. But from PO(y,z), there's a part of z not in y.

If z is entirely contained within x, and there's a part of z not in y, then that part of z must be in x but not in y. This is definitely possible, given that y is a proper part of x (not equal to x).

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, with neither being a subset of the other.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be entirely contained within x and not touch x's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPPi(x,z), this is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Another way to see this is to note that PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither being a subset of the other. This means:
- y and z share some region.
- There's a part of y not in z.
- There's a part of z not in y.

Since y is entirely within x, if z is also entirely within x (as in TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)), then the part of z not in y is still within x. This doesn't contradict any of the given constraints.

On the other hand, if z is not entirely within x (as in PO(x,z)), then the part of z not in y could be either inside or outside x. Again, this doesn't contradict any of the given constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I am now confident in this answer.

Actually, I have been making this way more complicated than it needs to be.

Let's just carefully consider the two constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, with neither being a subset of the other.

For any relation R(x,z), we need to check if there's a configuration that satisfies both constraints and R(x,z).

Let's be systematic:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Is this possible? No. Since y is part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share that overlapping region.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries.
   Is this possible? No. Since y is part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Is this possible? Yes, as shown in my previous drawing. x and z can share the region where y and z overlap, with parts of x not in z and parts of z not in x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? No. Since y is part of x and there's a part of y not in z (from PO(y,z)), there must be a part of x not in z. So x cannot be entirely contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? Yes, as shown in my previous drawing. z can be entirely contained within x, touch x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? Yes, as shown in my previous drawing. z can be entirely contained within x, not touch x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   Is this possible? No. Since y is a proper part of x (not equal to x) and y partially overlaps with z (not a subset of z), x and z cannot be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm very confident in this answer.

To summarize: Given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations can possibly hold between regions x and z, given the constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some part, but neither is contained in the other)

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Impossible: Since y overlaps with z and y is part of x, x and z must share at least the part where y and z overlap.

2. EC(x,z) - Impossible: For the same reason as DC, x and z must share interior points, not just boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: x and z can partially overlap. Since y is in x and overlaps with z, x and z share some region. Also, since there's a part of y not in z (from PO(y,z)), there's a part of x not in z, and there can be parts of z outside x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Impossible: If x were contained in z, then y would be contained in z (since y is in x), contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Impossible: For the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible: z can be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary, while partially overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible: z can be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary, while partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - Impossible: If x equaled z, then y would have to be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
