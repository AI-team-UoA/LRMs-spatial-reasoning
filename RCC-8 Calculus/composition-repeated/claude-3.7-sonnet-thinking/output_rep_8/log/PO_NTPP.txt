PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this. We have two relations:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

I need to determine what spatial relationship could hold between x and z.

Let's reason about this:
- We know x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y))
- We know y is fully contained within z with no boundary contact (NTPP(y,z))

This means that at least the part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z. However, the rest of x could be:
1. Entirely inside z (making x a proper part of z)
2. Partially inside z, partially outside (making x partially overlap with z)
3. Touching z's boundary from the inside (making x a tangential proper part of z)

Let me think about each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is impossible because x shares a part with y, and y is fully inside z. So x must at least have some connection with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is impossible because x overlaps with y, and y is fully inside z, so x must overlap with z to some extent.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible. x could have a part inside z (the part that overlaps with y) and a part outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is possible. x could be fully inside z but touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is possible. x could be fully inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because y is fully inside z, and x only partially overlaps with y, so x cannot fully contain z.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. This is impossible because we know PO(x,y), meaning x and y share some but not all parts, while NTPP(y,z) means y is properly contained in z. These two facts are inconsistent with x and z being equal.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part

Let me double-check by considering specific cases:

Case 1: PO(x,z)
If x extends beyond z's boundary while still having some part inside z (specifically, the part that overlaps with y), then PO(x,z) holds.

Case 2: TPP(x,z)
If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y, then TPP(x,z) holds.

Case 3: NTPP(x,z)
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

All three of these cases are consistent with PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), so the answer is that x and z can be related by PO, TPP, or NTPP.

Actually, let me be more careful and make sure I haven't missed anything. Let's think more carefully about the constraints:

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y share some part
- Some part of x is not in y
- Some part of y is not in x

NTPP(y,z) means:
- All of y is inside z
- y doesn't touch z's boundary

Given these constraints, let's reconsider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they share no parts. But since x shares parts with y, and y is fully inside z, x must share some parts with z. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. However, since x shares parts with y, and y is fully inside z (not touching z's boundary), x must share interior points with z. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible - the part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x can extend outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if all of x is inside z, including the part that overlaps with y, and some part of x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if all of x is inside z, including the part that overlaps with y, and no part of x touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But we know y is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y. If z were inside x, then at least the part of y that's not in x would also have to be in x (since y is inside z), which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. But we know x partially overlaps with y, while y is properly contained in z. If x equals z, then y would be properly contained in x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I need to double-check these results by trying to construct concrete counterexamples for the relations I deemed impossible.

Let's think visually:
- For DC(x,z): Since y is fully inside z and x overlaps with y, there's no way x can be disconnected from z.
- For EC(x,z): Since y doesn't touch z's boundary and x overlaps with y, x must have some interior points in common with z, so they can't be just externally connected.
- For TPPi(x,z): If z were inside x, then y would be inside x (since y is inside z), which contradicts the fact that x and y partially overlap.
- For NTPPi(x,z): Same reasoning as TPPi.
- For EQ(x,z): If x equals z, then y would be inside x, again contradicting PO(x,y).

This confirms my analysis that the only possible relations are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the final answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations could hold between x and z given that:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some parts but neither contains the other)
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, so x must share some part with z.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible because x must share interior points with z (via the overlap with y).

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x could have parts inside z (the part overlapping with y) and parts outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible - if z were inside x, then y would be inside x (since y is inside z), contradicting PO(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible - same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible - if x equals z, then y would be inside x, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
