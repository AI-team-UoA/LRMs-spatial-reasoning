PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step-by-step. 

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are spatially coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other)

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that y has with another region, x will have the same relationship with that region.

Given that PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z. Since x is equivalent to y (EQ(x,y)), x must also partially overlap with z.

So the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

To double check this:
- PO means partial overlap - some parts are shared, but neither region is contained in the other
- Since x = y (spatially), and y partially overlaps with z, x must partially overlap with z as well

The answer is that PO(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. The definition of EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region. This means that x and y are effectively the same region for the purposes of spatial relations.

Given that PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap, and x is equivalent to y, then x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does. 

So the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

Let me verify this by looking at the definitions again:

EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident - they are essentially the same spatial region.
PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Since x and y are the same spatial region (due to EQ(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z, x must also partially overlap with z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z).

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Since x and y are equivalent (occupy the same space), x must have the exact same spatial relationship with z as y does with z.

Given that PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (they share some interior points but neither is contained in the other), and x is equivalent to y, then x must also partially overlap with z.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
