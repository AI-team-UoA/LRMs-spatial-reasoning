PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

We know that:
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), meaning that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), meaning that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's figure out what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

Given:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, we know that z is inside x. This means z is a proper part of x. But we need to determine whether z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP).

Since z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, there are two possibilities:
1. z touches the part of y's boundary that also happens to be part of x's boundary. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x (TPP).
2. z touches a part of y's boundary that is inside x (not part of x's boundary). In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's try again and think about the possible configurations more systematically.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's consider where z can be in relation to x:

1. Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, z must be inside x. This rules out the following relations between x and z: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and EQ.

2. Since z is inside x, the possible relations are NTPP(z,x) or TPP(z,x).

For TPP(z,x) to hold, z must touch x's boundary. Since z touches y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, this is possible if z touches y's boundary exactly where y touches x's boundary.

For NTPP(z,x) to hold, z must not touch x's boundary. This is possible if z touches y's boundary, but not at the point where y touches x's boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I need to be more careful again. Let me use a third approach.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, we know that z is inside x. But the question is: does z touch x's boundary?

There are two possibilities:

1. z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary. In this case, z would touch x's boundary, and the relation would be TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

2. z touches y's boundary only at points where y does not touch x's boundary. In this case, z would not touch x's boundary, and the relation would be NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let's make sure we're clear about the definition of TPPi(x,y).

TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part inverse of y, which is the same as saying y is a tangential proper part of x, or TPP(y,x).

TPP(y,x) means that y is a proper part of x (y is contained in x) and y touches the boundary of x.

Now, let's apply this understanding:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is definitely inside x.

The question is: does z touch x's boundary?

If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, or TPP(z,x).

If z touches y's boundary only at points where y does not touch x's boundary, then z does not touch x's boundary. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check this by visualizing the possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary.
In this case, x contains y, y contains z, and z touches both y's boundary and x's boundary. The relation between x and z is TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

Scenario 2: z touches y's boundary, but only at points where y does not touch x's boundary.
In this case, x contains y, y contains z, and z touches y's boundary but not x's boundary. The relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I believe these are the only two possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, let me investigate other possibilities to make sure these are the only ones.

Could we have PO(x,z)?
No, because z is fully contained in y, and y is fully contained in x, so z must be fully contained in x. PO requires that they overlap but neither is fully contained in the other.

Could we have EQ(x,z)?
No, because z is fully contained in y, and y is fully contained in x, but y is not equal to x (y is a proper part of x). If z were equal to x, it would mean z contains y, which contradicts our premise that z is contained in y.

Could we have TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)?
No, because these would mean x is contained in z, which contradicts our understanding that z is contained in y, and y is contained in x.

Could we have DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)?
No, because these would mean x and z do not share interior points, which contradicts our understanding that z is contained in y, and y is contained in x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)

But I should triple-check my understanding.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x (y is inside x) and y touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y (z is inside y) and z touches the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Is z inside x?
Yes, because z is inside y and y is inside x.

Does z touch x's boundary?
It depends.

If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary. In this case, the relation between x and z is TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

If z touches y's boundary only at points where y does not touch x's boundary, then z does not touch x's boundary. In this case, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

This is a little confusing, but let me visualize it:

Picture x as a larger circle, y as a smaller circle inside x, and z as an even smaller circle inside y.

For TPPi(x,y), y is touching the boundary of x.
For TPPi(y,z), z is touching the boundary of y.

If z is touching y at a point where y is touching x, then z is also touching x. This gives us TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

If z is touching y at a point where y is not touching x, then z is not touching x. This gives us NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)

Let's consider the symmetry of the problem. TPPi(x,y) means that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. TPPi(y,z) means that z is inside y and touches the boundary of y. This transitive chain suggests the possibilities for the relationship between x and z.

In the context of the RCC-8 calculus, TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) means:
- x is a tangential proper part of y
- y is a tangential proper part of z

Wait, I think I've been interpreting the TPPi relation incorrectly. Let me correct my understanding.

TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part inverse of y, which is the same as saying y is a tangential proper part of x, or TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(x,y) means that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means that z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x.

But does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches y at a point where y touches x, then z also touches x. In this case, the relation is TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

If z touches y only at points where y does not touch x, then z does not touch x. In this case, the relation is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z), which is the same as TPP(z,x)
- NTPPi(x,z), which is the same as NTPP(z,x)

This matches my earlier conclusion, but I want to be absolutely sure. Let me draw it out one more time to check.

We have TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which means:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

This gives us that z is inside x.

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x. There are two possibilities:

1. z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, z also touches the boundary of x. This gives us TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

2. z touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, z does not touch the boundary of x. This gives us NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)

I believe these are the only two possible relationships given the constraints.

So, if TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's make sure I'm really clear. The question asks for "relationships between x and z" and I have to give the answer in the RCC-8 calculus.

The relation TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. This is one of the possible relationships.

The relation NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the other possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z in the RCC-8 calculus are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, no, I need to recheck this.

TPPi(x,y) means "y is a tangential proper part of x", i.e., y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of y", i.e., z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

So we have:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

This implies that z is inside x. 

Now, does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. This gives us the relationship TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

If z touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. This gives us the relationship NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But wait, I need to make sure I understand TPPi correctly.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y).

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, which means that x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.

So, TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means that y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

Based on this understanding:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

This implies that z is a proper part of x.

But does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. This gives us the relationship TPP(z,x).

If z touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. This gives us the relationship NTPP(z,x).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

But the question asks for the relationship in the form of x and z, not z and x. 

TPP(z,x) is the same as TPPi(x,z), which means that z is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPP(z,x) is the same as NTPPi(x,z), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I think this is the correct answer, but let me double-check one more time.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x).
TPP(y,x) means that y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

Similarly, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y).
TPP(z,y) means that z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

This implies that z is a proper part of x.

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. This gives us TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

If z touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. This gives us NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I believe this is the correct answer. To summarize:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Wait a second. I just realized I've been inconsistent in my notation. Let's be more precise and ensure that I haven't erred in my reasoning.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
- y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.

From these, we can deduce that z is a proper part of x. But does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, or TPP(z,x).

If z touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x).

So, the possible relationships between z and x are:
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

But the question asks for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. So, we need to express these in terms of x and z.

TPP(z,x) is the same as TPPi(x,z), which means that z is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPP(z,x) is the same as NTPPi(x,z), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I think this is the correct answer. Let me triple-check.

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then:
- y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.

Since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x.

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, the relationship is TPPi(x,z).

If z touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, the relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I've been inconsistent in my notation at times, but I think my reasoning is sound. 

The final answer is: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I keep confusing myself with the inversion notation TPPi. Let me think one more time, focusing on the definitions given.

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we have:
- y is a tangential proper part of x.
- z is a tangential proper part of y.

This means:
- y is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is contained in y and touches the boundary of y.

From these, we can deduce that z is contained in x, since z is contained in y and y is contained in x.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, which is TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

If z touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I believe this is the correct answer, and I've been consistent in my reasoning this time.

OK, let me think about this one more time, very clearly, to see if I have it right.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Given these two conditions, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x. 

But does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as TPP(z,x).

If z touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x).

So, the possible relationships between z and x are:
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

But the question asks for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. 

TPP(z,x) is the same as TPPi(x,z), which means that z is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPP(z,x) is the same as NTPPi(x,z), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

So, if TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how regions x and z relate when we know that TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, we know that z is inside x. This means z must be some kind of proper part of x.

Now I need to determine whether z touches x's boundary:

1. If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary. This would make z a tangential proper part of x, giving us TPPi(x,z).

2. If z only touches y's boundary at points where y doesn't touch x's boundary, then z doesn't touch x's boundary. This would make z a non-tangential proper part of x, giving us NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible given the constraints, so both relations are possible.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
