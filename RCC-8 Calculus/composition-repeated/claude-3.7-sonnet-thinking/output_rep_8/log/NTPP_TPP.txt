PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the question step by step.

We know:
1. NTPP(x,y) - x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z) - y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that x is completely inside y, and y is inside z, it follows that x is inside z. But we need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

Since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)), it's possible that x could either:
1. Touch the boundary of z through the part where y touches z.
2. Not touch the boundary of z if the part of y that touches z doesn't overlap with x.

Let's think about this more carefully:

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary. Since x is strictly inside y, it can't touch any part of y's boundary, including the part where y touches z's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these constraints, x cannot touch the boundary of z because x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Therefore, x is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

However, I want to double-check this. Let's visualize:

1. x is a region strictly inside y.
2. y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For x to touch the boundary of z, x would need to touch the boundary of y at the exact point where y touches the boundary of z. But since NTPP(x,y) specifies that x doesn't touch the boundary of y, this is impossible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more precise. Let's reconsider:

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's imagine a concrete example:
- Imagine y as a circle that's inside a larger circle z but touches the boundary of z at one point.
- Now, imagine x as a smaller circle completely inside y without touching y's boundary.

In this scenario, x is also completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

However, let's check if there's any other possible configuration that satisfies the given constraints but results in a different relationship between x and z:

Could x and z be disconnected (DC)? No, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x must be inside z.

Could x and z externally connect (EC)? No, because as we established, x can't touch the boundary of z.

Could x and z partially overlap (PO)? No, because x is entirely inside z.

Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)? No, because x can't touch the boundary of z, as we've discussed.

Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)? No, because x is inside z, not the other way around.

Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)? No, for the same reason as above.

Could x and z be equal (EQ)? No, because x is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside z, so x can't be equal to z.

So, it seems that the only possible relationship between x and z is indeed NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. I need to be even more careful here. 

Let's reconsider TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

This means that y touches the boundary of z at some point, but it doesn't mean that the entire boundary of z is touched by y. There could be parts of z's boundary that are not touched by y.

Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary. This doesn't necessarily mean that x is far from the boundary of y. It could be very close, but not touching.

Now, if the part of y that touches the boundary of z is close to where x is inside y, then x could potentially be close to the boundary of z. But being "close" doesn't change the spatial relationship. What matters is whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

Since x doesn't touch the boundary of y, and the only way for x to touch the boundary of z would be through the boundary of y, it's clear that x cannot touch the boundary of z. Therefore, x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

I believe my analysis is correct, and the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me visualize this again:

1. NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some point (but not necessarily all of z's boundary).

Now, consider a scenario where y is a circle inside a larger circle z and touching z's boundary at one point. Inside y, there's a smaller circle x that doesn't touch y's boundary. In this case, x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, corresponding to NTPP(x,z).

But what if y is a more complex shape? Could there be a configuration where x touches the boundary of z despite not touching the boundary of y?

No, I don't think so. For x to touch the boundary of z, it would need to extend beyond the boundary of y (which contradicts NTPP(x,y)) or touch the boundary of y at the point where y touches the boundary of z (which also contradicts NTPP(x,y)).

So, I'm confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, but actually I'm not accounting for another possibility. Let's re-evaluate:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

What if y touches the boundary of z at a specific point p, and x is completely inside y but very close to the boundary of y at point p? In this case, x would be close to the boundary of z, but would it touch it?

No, it wouldn't. For x to touch the boundary of z, it would need to extend up to that boundary. But we know that x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so x can't reach the boundary of z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is still NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, but I feel like I might be missing something. Let's take one more approach. In RCC-8, the relationships are based on the spatial interiors and boundaries of regions. Let's use these to analyze:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and the boundary of x doesn't intersect with the boundary of y.
- TPP(y,z): The interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of z, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of z at some point.

What's the relationship between x and z?

The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, which is a proper subset of the interior of z. So, the interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z.

Now, does the boundary of x intersect with the boundary of z? We know that the boundary of x doesn't intersect with the boundary of y, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of z at some point. Therefore, the boundary of x, which is completely inside y, can't reach or touch the boundary of z. As a result, the boundary of x doesn't intersect with the boundary of z.

Given these conditions, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

In conclusion, if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually, I'm not fully convinced because I might be misunderstanding the definition of TPP(y,z). Let me revisit it.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is entirely inside z, and there's at least one point where the boundary of y touches the boundary of z. It doesn't mean that the entire boundary of y touches the boundary of z.

Now, imagine a scenario where y is a complex shape inside z, and there's a specific point p where the boundary of y touches the boundary of z. Inside y, there's a region x which is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)).

In this scenario, the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of y, so it can't touch the boundary of z at point p. Additionally, since x is entirely inside y, and y is entirely inside z, x is entirely inside z.

Therefore, x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

I think I'm correct, and NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

But actually, let's just double check one more time using the precise definitions of the relations.

NTPP(x,y): Region x is a non-tangential proper part of region y.
- x is completely inside y.
- There's no point on the boundary of x that touches the boundary of y.

TPP(y,z): Region y is a tangential proper part of region z.
- y is completely inside z.
- There's at least one point on the boundary of y that touches the boundary of z.

Given these, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, x is completely inside z.

Does the boundary of x touch the boundary of z? The boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of y, and the only way for it to touch the boundary of z would be through the boundary of y, which isn't possible. Therefore, the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these conditions, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me try a different approach. We can use the composition table for RCC-8 to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

I'll write it out as a composition: NTPP ° TPP, which means we're determining the possible relationships for x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

From the RCC-8 composition table, NTPP ° TPP yields NTPP. This confirms that if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

Ok, so I just need to verify the composition NTPP ° TPP from the RCC-8 composition table, which I'm deriving below (for the question at hand).

Let's think about it in terms of interior and boundary intersections:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
   - The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y.
   - The boundary of x doesn't intersect with the boundary of y.

2. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some point.
   - The interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of z.
   - The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z at some point.

Given these, what's the relationship between x and z?

The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, which is a proper subset of the interior of z. So, the interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z.

Does the boundary of x intersect with the boundary of z? The boundary of x doesn't intersect with the boundary of y, and the only way for it to intersect with the boundary of z would be through the boundary of y. Since that's not the case, the boundary of x doesn't intersect with the boundary of z.

These conditions define NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

This checks out. So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, hold on. I think I was correct that the composition of NTPP with TPP is NTPP in the RCC-8 composition table. But let me double check that the composition table is just one single relationship, rather than multiple possible relationships.

The RCC-8 composition table provides the possible relationships between regions x and z given known relationships between x and y, and y and z. In some cases, the composition can result in multiple possible relationships, meaning that given the constraints, several relationships are possible between x and z.

However, for the composition of NTPP and TPP, I'm fairly confident that the result is just NTPP, meaning that if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But let me double check.

Actually, to be thorough, let's go through each of the RCC-8 relationships and determine if they're possible for the relation between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z):

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This would mean x and z share no points. But since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is also inside z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. However, since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is also inside z, so they share interior points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This would mean x and z share some interior points, but each has some interior points that the other doesn't. However, since x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, all of x's interior points are also interior points of z. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But as we've discussed, given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), x can't touch the boundary of z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. As we've established, this is consistent with NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse of TPP: This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But since x is inside y, and y is inside z, this is not possible. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse of NTPP: This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But, as with TPPi, this is not possible given the constraints. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. But since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is strictly smaller than z. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Given this analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z), which confirms our earlier conclusion.

So, if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

Actually, on second thought, I wonder if I'm missing a possible configuration. Let's consider a scenario:

Imagine a donut-shaped region z. Inside this donut, there's a circular region y (which is a TPP of z because it touches the inner boundary of the donut). Inside y, there's a smaller circular region x (which is an NTPP of y).

In this scenario, x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary (so NTPP(x,y)). And y is inside z and touches the inner boundary of z (so TPP(y,z)).

But what's the relationship between x and z? x is completely inside z, but does it touch the boundary of z?

Given the constraints, x is completely inside y, and y touches the inner boundary of z. But since x doesn't touch the boundary of y, it can't touch the boundary of z. Therefore, x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

I've considered various scenarios, and in all of them, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). This is because x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary. The combination of these constraints ensures that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Given this, I'm confident that if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's make sure we're not missing anything with a counter example. Imagine a specific case where the relationship between x and z is not NTPP(x,z), and see if it's consistent with NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

For instance, let's try to construct a case where TPP(x,z), meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary:

If x touches the boundary of z, then x must extend all the way to the boundary of z. But given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. The only way for x to touch the boundary of z would be if y completely overlaps with z at that boundary point, which would mean y extends beyond z, contradicting TPP(y,z).

Similarly, let's try to construct a case where PO(x,z), meaning x and z partially overlap:

For this to happen, x would need to have some part outside of z. But given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. And given TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. Therefore, x is completely inside z, making PO(x,z) impossible.

I've tried to think of counter examples for the other relationships, and they all lead to contradictions with the given constraints.

Therefore, I'm confident that if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me just consider the case of an n-dimensional torus, where we have NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z). In this case, what is the relation between x and z? Let's say that z is the entire torus. And y is a subset of the torus that touches the boundary of the torus. 

Actually, this doesn't work because a torus doesn't have a boundary in the usual sense.

Let's think more straightforwardly: Can we construct a scenario where NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), but the relationship between x and z is something other than NTPP(x,z)?

Given the constraints, we know:
- x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary at at least one point.

For the relationship between x and z to be something other than NTPP(x,z), one of the following would need to be true:
1. x is not completely inside z.
2. x touches the boundary of z.

The first case is impossible. If x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, then x is completely inside z.

The second case is also impossible. For x to touch the boundary of z, it would need to touch the boundary of y at the exact point where y touches the boundary of z. But since NTPP(x,y) specifies that x doesn't touch the boundary of y, this is impossible.

Therefore, I'm still convinced that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

One final check. Let's go back to the RCC-8 composition table. The entry for NTPP ° TPP should give us the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

According to the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of NTPP and TPP is NTPP. This confirms that if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Great, so NTPP(x,z) is indeed the only possible relationship.

In conclusion, if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relation(s) can exist between x and z, given the two specified relations.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let's analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. Since x is completely inside y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (from TPP(y,z)), x must be completely inside z.

2. Can x touch the boundary of z? For this to happen, x would need to touch y's boundary at the exact point where y touches z's boundary. But NTPP(x,y) explicitly states that x doesn't touch y's boundary anywhere. Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary.

3. Since x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relation is possible in this scenario.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
