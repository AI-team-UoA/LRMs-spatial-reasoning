PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through this problem. We have:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they are essentially the same region. This means that the relationship between x and z must be the same as the relationship between x and y.

Given that DC(x,y), which means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts, and y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x and z must also be disconnected and share no spatial parts.

So, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

To double-check this: If x is disconnected from y, and y is identical to z, then x must be disconnected from z as well. There's no other possible relationship in this case.

My final answer is that the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relation holds between x and z given the two relations we know.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same spatial region, any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and y is exactly the same as z (EQ(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
