PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm being asked to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relations mean:

PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained within the other.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They share no spatial parts and don't even touch at their boundaries.

Now, I need to figure out what relations are possible between x and z given these constraints.

Since PO(x,y), x has some part that overlaps with y, and it also has some part that's outside of y.

Since DC(y,z), z is completely separate from y.

Let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y cannot overlap with z (since y and z are disconnected), but the part of x that's outside of y could still be completely separate from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. The part of x that's outside of y could touch z at a boundary, while the part of x that overlaps with y must remain separate from z.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. The part of x that's outside of y could overlap with z, creating a partial overlap between x and z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. The part of x that's outside of y could be contained within z, and x could touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. The part of x that's outside of y could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, as long as z doesn't overlap with the part of x that overlaps with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, as long as z doesn't overlap with the part of x that overlaps with y.

8. EQ(x,z): This doesn't seem possible because if x and z were equal, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y, which contradicts the given DC(y,z).

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let me reconsider TPPi and NTPPi.

For TPPi(x,z), this means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. But if z is contained in x, and part of x overlaps with y, it's possible that z also overlaps with y, which would contradict DC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is only possible if z is positioned in such a way that it's contained in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is contained in x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, z must be positioned entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, for this to be consistent with DC(y,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. But we also know that z is disconnected from y, which means z cannot be in the part of x that overlaps with y. 

Actually, wait a minute, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me draw a simple example.

Let's say x is the left two-thirds of a square, y is the right two-thirds of the same square, and z is a small circle outside the square to the right. Then PO(x,y) because they overlap in the middle third of the square, and DC(y,z) because z is outside the square and disconnected from y. What's the relation between x and z? It's DC(x,z) because x is also contained within the square and doesn't reach z.

But let's try another example: x is the left two-thirds of a square, y is the right two-thirds of the same square, and z is a small circle outside the square to the left, touching the left edge of the square. Then PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) still hold, but now EC(x,z) because x touches z at the left edge of the square.

And if z is a circle that overlaps with the left part of x (the part that doesn't overlap with y), then PO(x,z) holds.

I can also imagine scenarios where TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) holds, by making z a larger region that contains x or part of x.

Actually, I think one key insight I'm missing is that the part of x that does not overlap with y can have any relation with z. The only constraint is that the part of x that does overlap with y cannot overlap with z.

So, let's revisit the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): Possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible.

But what about the inverse relations?

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Is this consistent with the given information? If z is a proper part of x, and PO(x,y), then z could potentially overlap with y, which would contradict DC(y,z). But this overlap isn't necessary; z could be contained entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, contained entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But if x and y partially overlap, and x and z are the same, then z and y would also partially overlap, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me just double-check TPPi and NTPPi with concrete examples.

For TPPi(x,z): Let's say x is a large square, y is a circle that partially overlaps with the right side of x, and z is a smaller square contained within the left side of x (the part that doesn't overlap with y). Then z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z). And z is disconnected from y, so DC(y,z). And x and y partially overlap, so PO(x,y). This example is consistent, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Let's say x is a large square, y is a circle that partially overlaps with the right side of x, and z is a small circle contained entirely within the left side of x, not touching x's boundary. Then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z). And z is disconnected from y, so DC(y,z). And x and y partially overlap, so PO(x,y). This example is consistent, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I see where the misunderstanding might be coming from. When thinking about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), I was worried about the overlap between z and y. But I must remember that DC(y,z) is a given, so z is definitely disconnected from y. This constraint doesn't cause any issues if I carefully place z in a part of x that doesn't overlap with y.

So, based on my analysis, the possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

And EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation given the constraints.

Actually, let me double-check EQ(x,z) as well. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. But we know that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z). If x and z are the same, then x would be disconnected from y (since z is disconnected from y), which contradicts PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z)

EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I should double-check. Looking at TPP(x,z). We have that x is a part of z and x touches z's boundary. 

Hmm, now that I think about it, I think I've made a mistake with TPP and NTPP. 

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. But if x is partially overlapping with y, and x is entirely contained within z, then there's a part of z that overlaps with y. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me confirm this with a picture. If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some spatial part. But if x is contained in z, then this shared part between x and y would also be in z, which means z and y would overlap. This contradicts DC(y,z).

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible. If x is entirely contained within z and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, let me revise. The possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

And the relations that are not possible are:
6. TPP(x,z)
7. NTPP(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

Actually wait. Let me think about TPP(x,z) again. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained within z. If x also partially overlaps with y, then there's a part of z that overlaps with y.

Actually, wait, let me back up. 

PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap. There is some region that is both part of x and part of y.

DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected. They share no spatial parts.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z.

If PO(x,y), then x has a part that overlaps with y and a part that doesn't overlap with y.

If DC(y,z), then z has no part that overlaps with y.

If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. But if x partially overlaps with y, and x is entirely contained within z, then there would be a part of z that overlaps with y, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Similarly, if NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if x partially overlaps with y, and x is entirely contained within z, then there would be a part of z that overlaps with y, which contradicts DC(y,z).

I'm pretty confident that TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

And as I established earlier, EQ(x,z) is also not possible because if x and z were equal, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I should rethink TPPi(x,z) as well. TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Is this consistent with the given constraints?

If z is a proper part of x, and z is disconnected from y, then z must be contained entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. This is possible, especially if z is positioned to touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, z can be positioned entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is also a possible relation.

I think my conclusion is correct. The possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, one more concrete example. Let's say y is a circle at the center of a square grid, x is a rectangle that covers the left half of the grid (including part of y), and z is a small circle in the top-right corner of the grid. Then PO(x,y) because x overlaps with part of y, and DC(y,z) because y and z are disconnected. And DC(x,z) because x and z are also disconnected.

If I move z to the left edge of the grid, right at the boundary of x, then EC(x,z) holds.

If I move z slightly inside the left half of the grid, but outside of y, then PO(x,z) holds.

If I keep z small and contained entirely within the left half of the grid (but outside of y), not touching the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

If I allow z to touch the boundary of x (but still keeping it entirely within the left half of the grid and outside of y), then TPPi(x,z) holds.

But there's no way to have TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or EQ(x,z) without contradicting the given constraints. So I believe my conclusion is correct.

So, the possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's analyze what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some part, but neither is contained in the other)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no parts)

To determine possible x-z relationships, I need to consider how the overlap between x and y constrains x's relationship with z.

Since y and z share no parts (DC), any part of x that overlaps with y cannot overlap with z. This rules out some possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be completely separate from z
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can touch z at a boundary
3. PO(x,z): Possible - the non-y-overlapping part of x can overlap with z
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible - if x were inside z, the x-y overlap would force y to overlap with z
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - same reason as TPP
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be contained in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be fully inside x, away from y
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - would force z to overlap with y

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
