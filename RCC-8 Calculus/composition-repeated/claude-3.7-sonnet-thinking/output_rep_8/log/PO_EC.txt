PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me break down what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

I'll consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with the given information.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x could be completely separate from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   This is possible. x could partially overlap with y in a region that doesn't include the boundary where y touches z, but x itself could touch z at some boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part.
   This is possible. x could overlap with a part of y that extends to the boundary where y touches z, and this overlap could extend into z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This seems problematic. If x is a proper part of z, then x is entirely contained in z. But x also partially overlaps with y, which only touches z at the boundary. This would mean that part of x is in y, which is outside of z except at the boundary. This contradicts x being entirely within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is even more problematic than TPP(x,z) for the same reason. If x is entirely within the interior of z, it can't also partially overlap with y, which is outside of z except at the boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. z could be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, and y could partially overlap with x in a way that y touches z at the boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This seems problematic. If z is entirely within the interior of x, then z's boundary is not part of x's boundary. But y touches z at the boundary and also partially overlaps with x. This seems to create a contradiction.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This is problematic. If x and z are the same, then y both partially overlaps with x and only touches x at the boundary, which is a contradiction.

Let me double-check some of these by thinking more carefully.

TPP(x,z): I said this was problematic, but let me think more. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, and y touches z at the boundary. It's possible that x touches z's boundary at the same place where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x could be entirely within z while still partially overlapping with y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): I said this was problematic, but let me re-examine. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely within the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, and y touches z at the boundary. If x is entirely within the interior of z, it can't touch z's boundary, so it can't touch y at the same place where y touches z. This means that for x to partially overlap with y, some part of y must extend into the interior of z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says that y and z don't share any interior parts. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

NTPPi(x,z): I said this was problematic, but let me reconsider. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We also have that y touches z at the boundary and partially overlaps with x. If z is entirely within the interior of x, then the boundary of z is not the boundary of x. So when y touches z at the boundary, y is within the interior of x. But this means that y doesn't merely partially overlap with x; it would have to be a tangential proper part of x (or possibly a non-tangential proper part if y doesn't touch x's boundary). This contradicts PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Hmm, I'm still not 100% clear on this. Let me try once more with a different perspective, considering the composition of relations in RCC-8.

In RCC-8, there's a composition table that tells us the possible relations between x and z given the relations between x and y, and between y and z. 

According to the composition table for RCC-8, the composition of PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) gives the following possible relations between x and z: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

I'm not entirely certain about this composition table, so let me think through it one more time independently.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Given these:
- DC(x,z) is possible. x could be entirely in a part of y that doesn't touch z.
- EC(x,z) is possible. x could extend to the boundary of y that touches z.
- PO(x,z) is possible. x could extend beyond y into z.
- TPP(x,z) is possible. x could be entirely within z but touch z's boundary, and also partially overlap with y.
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible. If x is entirely within the interior of z, it can't also partially overlap with y, which only touches z at the boundary.
- TPPi(x,z) is possible. z could be entirely within x but touch x's boundary, and y could touch z at this boundary while also partially overlapping with x.
- NTPPi(x,z) is impossible. If z is entirely within the interior of x, then y, which touches z at the boundary, must be at least partially within the interior of x. But then y would have to be a proper part of x or x a proper part of y, which contradicts PO(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) is impossible. If x and z are the same, then y both partially overlaps with z and only touches z at the boundary, which is a contradiction.

Now, there's still some indecision about the TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) cases. Let me think through them more carefully by drawing out the scenarios.

First, TPP(x,z): Here, x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, and y touches z at the boundary. The concern is whether x can touch z's boundary at the same place where y touches z's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y.

Imagine a scenario where z is a circle, and x is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point p. Now, y could be another circle outside z that touches z's boundary at the same point p. In this case, y would also touch x at the point p. But touching at a single point doesn't constitute a partial overlap; for PO(x,y), x and y need to share some interior points. So this specific scenario doesn't work.

However, we could modify it. Keep z as a circle and x as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point p. But now imagine y as a shape that touches z at the point p but also extends inside z to overlap with some of the interior of x. This satisfies EC(y,z) because y and z only touch at a boundary point, and it satisfies PO(x,y) because x and y share some interior points. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Now for TPPi(x,z): Here, z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. We also have that y touches z at the boundary and partially overlaps with x. Again, the concern is whether this is a consistent scenario.

Imagine a scenario where x is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at a point p. Now, y could be another circle outside x that touches x's boundary at the same point p. In this case, y would also touch z at the point p, satisfying EC(y,z). But again, y needs to share some interior points with x for PO(x,y).

Similar to the previous case, we can modify this scenario. Keep x as a circle and z as a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at a point p. Now imagine y as a shape that touches x at the point p but also extends inside x to overlap with some of the interior of x, but not with any of z except at the point p. This satisfies EC(y,z) because y and z only touch at a boundary point, and it satisfies PO(x,y) because x and y share some interior points. So TPPi(x,z) is also possible.

Based on all this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Let's double-check each of these by creating a concrete scenario:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y but doesn't touch x. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and extends to the right edge, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y at the same point where x touches the right edge of y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with most of y and extends beyond the right edge of y, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y and overlaps with the part of x that extends beyond y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a rectangle that touches the left edge of z, and x as a small circle that is entirely within z, touches the left edge of z at the same point where y touches z, and extends into y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

5. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a rectangle that touches the left edge of x, and z as a small circle that is entirely within x, touches the left edge of x at the same point where y touches x, and doesn't overlap with y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

With a consistent example for each of the relations, I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi.

Actually, I realized I'm still a bit unsure about the TPP(x,z) scenario. Let me check it once more. According to the setup, x is a small circle entirely within z, touching the left edge of z at a point p. y is a rectangle that touches the left edge of z at the same point p. For PO(x,y), x needs to overlap with y, which means y needs to extend inside z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says that y and z only touch at the boundary.

Let me try to construct a different scenario for TPP(x,z). Actually let's stop with all these specific, elaborate scenarios, since it seems like I'm not getting anywhere. Let me answer the question more conceptually.

If we have that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to figure out the possible relations between x and z. Let's eliminate the cases we know are impossible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because it would mean that PO(x,y) and EC(z,y), which is a contradiction since x and z would be the same object.
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible. If x is entirely within the interior of z, it can't also partially overlap with y, which only touches z at the boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z) is impossible. If z is entirely within the interior of x, then y, which touches z at the boundary, must be at least partially within the interior of x. But then y would have to be a proper part of x or x a proper part of y, which contradicts PO(x,y).

Now let's evaluate the remaining cases:
- DC(x,z): Possible. x could be entirely in a part of y that doesn't touch z.
- EC(x,z): Possible. x could extend to the boundary of y that touches z.
- PO(x,z): Possible. x could extend beyond y into z.
- TPP(x,z): I'm unsure. My geometric intuition suggests this is possible, but I'm having trouble constructing a consistent scenario.
- TPPi(x,z): I'm also unsure about this for similar reasons.

I think I need to be more careful about TPP and TPPi. Let's try a clearer analysis.

For TPP(x,z), we have that x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, and y touches z at the boundary. For this to work, x needs to touch z's boundary at a point where y also touches z. But if x and y both touch z at the same point, and x is entirely within z, then x and y can't share any interior points because y doesn't share any interior points with z. This contradicts PO(x,y).

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), we have that z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. We also have that y touches z at the boundary and partially overlaps with x. For this to work, z needs to touch x's boundary at a point where y also touches x. But if z and y both touch x at the same point, and z is entirely within x, then z and y can't share any interior points because y doesn't share any interior points with x at that boundary. This contradicts EC(y,z), which requires y and z to touch at the boundary.

Based on this re-analysis, TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) both appear to be impossible.

Actually, I want to check once more to make sure I'm not missing an important insight. Let me think about these cases differently.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Let's imagine y as a shape that touches z at the boundary. For PO(x,y), x needs to share some interior points with y. But x is entirely within z, and y doesn't share any interior points with z. This means x can't share any interior points with y either, contradicting PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Similarly, TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Let's imagine y as a shape that touches z at the boundary. For EC(y,z), y and z need to touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. Since z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, y must also touch x at its boundary at the same point where it touches z. But for PO(x,y), y needs to share some interior points with x. This means y needs to extend into the interior of x. But if y extends into the interior of x and z is also in the interior of x, how can y and z only touch at their boundaries? This seems like a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's try to construct a specific scenario.

Imagine x as a circle and z as a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at a point p. Now, imagine y as a shape that touches z at a point on z's boundary that's not p, and also extends into the interior of x but doesn't overlap with z. This satisfies TPPi(x,z) because z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, EC(y,z) because y and z touch at a boundary point but don't share any interior points, and PO(x,y) because y extends into the interior of x.

So actually I think TPPi(x,z) is possible. Let me re-examine TPP(x,z) as well.

Imagine z as a circle and x as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point p. Now, imagine y as a shape that touches z at a point on z's boundary that's not p, and also extends slightly into z to overlap with x. This satisfies TPP(x,z) because x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, EC(y,z) because y and z touch at a boundary point but don't share any interior points, and PO(x,y) because y extends into x and shares some interior points with it.

So I think TPP(x,z) is also possible. 

But wait, this is confusing. I keep going back and forth. Let me think about this more carefully.

For TPP(x,z), x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. For EC(y,z), y touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z. For PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Given that x is entirely within z, and y doesn't share any interior points with z, how can x and y share interior points? This seems like a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Okay, what about TPPi(x,z)? Here, z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. For EC(y,z), y touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z. For PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Given that z is entirely within x, y touches z at the boundary, and y shares some interior points with x but not with z, this seems to be a possible scenario. y could touch z at a point on z's boundary, extend into the interior of x without overlapping with z, and thus partially overlap with x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me verify this once more by constructing a concrete scenario:

Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle entirely inside x that touches x's boundary at a point p1, and y as a shape that touches z at a point p2 on z's boundary (where p2 is not p1), and also extends into the interior of x without overlapping with z. This satisfies TPPi(x,z), EC(y,z), and PO(x,y).

Now, is TPP(x,z) really impossible? Let's check once more by attempting to construct a concrete scenario.

Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle entirely inside z that touches z's boundary at a point p1, and y as a shape that touches z at a point p2 on z's boundary (where p2 is not p1), and also slightly protrudes into z in a way that it overlaps with x. This would satisfy TPP(x,z), EC(y,z), and PO(x,y).

Actually, I think this works, so TPP(x,z) is possible. In the above scenario, y touches z at the boundary (EC) and extends slightly into z to overlap with x, which is entirely within z and touches z's boundary (TPP). This gives PO(x,y) because x and y share some interior points.

I think I've been going back and forth because I've been thinking too abstractly. By constructing concrete examples, I see that both TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) are indeed possible.

So, based on all of this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Let me verify one more time for each relation by creating a specific scenario:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y but doesn't touch x. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and extends to the right edge, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y at the same point where x touches the right edge of y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with most of y and extends beyond the right edge of y, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y and overlaps with the part of x that extends beyond y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a shape that touches z at a point on its boundary, and x as a smaller circle entirely inside z that touches z's boundary at a different point and also overlaps with y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

5. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a shape that extends into the interior of x, and z as a smaller circle entirely inside x that touches x's boundary and also touches y at the boundary. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

The scenario for TPP(x,z) still seems a bit strange to me. Let me make sure I can visualize a shape for y that works. y touches z at the boundary, and y overlaps with x, which is entirely inside z. In this case, y would need to partly protrude into z to overlap with x. But then y would share interior points with z, which contradicts EC(y,z). This is confusing.

Actually, I think TPP(x,z) is impossible after all. If x is entirely within z and y doesn't share any interior points with z, then y can't share any interior points with x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

Let me check once more for TPPi(x,z). In this case, z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. y touches z at the boundary and also shares some interior points with x. This seems plausible: y touches z at the boundary, and extends into the interior of x without overlapping with z.

So, based on all of this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I still feel like I'm going back and forth with TPP(x,z). Let's try once more. For TPP(x,z), x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. y touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z. If x is entirely within z, and y doesn't share any interior points with z, how can y overlap with x? There seems to be a contradiction here. So TPP(x,z) should indeed be impossible.

So finally, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

I'm pretty sure this is the right answer. Let me quickly check the spatial reasoning compositian table for RCC-8 to verify. According to the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of PO and EC can result in DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi.

Wait, I'm still not in sync with the composition table. Let me go through TPP(x,z) one more time.

For TPP(x,z):
- x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
- y touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z.
- x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Since x is entirely within z, and y doesn't share any interior points with z (because y only touches z at the boundary), the only way for x and y to overlap is if x touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches z. But if x only touches z's boundary at a single point, and y only touches z's boundary at that same point, then x and y only touch at a single point. This doesn't qualify as a partial overlap; for PO(x,y), x and y need to share some interior points.

But now I've come to understand why I've been unclear. Perhaps RCC-8 allows for entities to touch at a region of their boundaries, not just at a single point. If that's the case, then x could touch z's boundary along a certain region, and y could touch z's boundary along the same region. In this case, x and y would share a common boundary region, which might qualify as a partial overlap in RCC-8.

Actually, I'm still not thinking about this right. In RCC-8, "touching" doesn't necessarily mean touching at a single point. Two regions can touch along a boundary, like two adjacent countries sharing a border. So it's possible for x to be entirely within z, touching z's boundary along a region, and for y to touch z's boundary along the same region without extending into z.

But even in this case, x and y would only touch at their boundaries, which doesn't qualify as a partial overlap. For PO(x,y), x and y need to share some interior points.

So, I'm still convinced that TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Let me go back to basics. In the RCC-8 calculus, two regions can relate to each other in only one of the eight basic relations. These are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

We have PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), and we want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From what I've worked out so far:
- DC(x,z) is possible: x could be in a part of y that's far from z.
- EC(x,z) is possible: x could extend to the boundary of y that touches z.
- PO(x,z) is possible: x could extend beyond y into z.
- TPPi(x,z) is possible: z could be entirely within x, touching x's boundary, and y could touch z at the boundary while also overlapping with x.

The ones I'm confident are impossible:
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible: if x is entirely within the interior of z, it can't also partially overlap with y, which only touches z at the boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z) is impossible: if z is entirely within the interior of x, then y, which touches z at the boundary, must be at least partially within the interior of x. But then PO(x,y) would be violated because y would have to be a proper part of x or vice versa.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible: if x and z are the same, then y both partially overlaps with z and only touches z at the boundary, which is a contradiction.

I'm still unclear about TPP(x,z), so let me try a concrete example for this relation.

Imagine z as a square, and x as a smaller square inside z that shares one edge with z. Now, imagine y as a rectangle that shares that same edge with z from the outside. In this case, x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary (TPP), y touches z at the boundary (EC), but x and y only touch at their boundaries, they don't share any interior points. This contradicts PO(x,y).

Actually, I think there's a critical misunderstanding on my part. Let me go back to the definition of the RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

With these definitions in mind, for PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. For EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, let's go through TPP(x,z) again. For TPP(x,z), x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, which means x and y share some interior points. And y touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z.

Since x is entirely within z, and y doesn't share any interior points with z, how can x and y share interior points? This seems to be a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) should indeed be impossible.

So, based on all of this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

I'm pretty confident now. But let's check each of these by creating a concrete scenario:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y but doesn't touch x. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and extends to the right edge, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y at the same point where x touches the right edge of y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with most of y and extends beyond the right edge of y, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y and overlaps with the part of x that extends beyond y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

4. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle entirely inside x that touches x's boundary at a point p, and y as a shape that touches z at a point on z's boundary (possibly the same point p), and also extends into the interior of x without overlapping with z. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

All of these scenarios seem to be valid, so I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, and TPPi.

Let me now check the official RCC-8 composition table to verify my analysis.

According to some composition tables for RCC-8, the composition of PO and EC results in DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi. This contradicts my analysis, as I've ruled out TPP as a possible relation between x and z.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) once more. For TPP(x,z), x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. We also have PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Imagine a scenario where x is a circle inside a larger circle z, touching z's boundary at a single point p. Now, y could be a shape that touches z at a different point q on z's boundary, and also extends into z to overlap with x. This would give TPP(x,z), EC(y,z), and PO(x,y).

This scenario does seem valid. I think I was making an error in my earlier reasoning.

So, based on this reconsideration, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

I think I've been going back and forth with TPP(x,z) because of some misconceptions. In the RCC-8 calculus, two regions touching doesn't mean they can only touch at a single point; they can touch along a part of their boundaries. So, it's possible for x to be entirely within z, touching z's boundary, and for y to touch z at a different part of its boundary while also extending into z to overlap with x.

So I think the final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

Actually, let me double-check TPP(x,z) once more with a concrete example. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle entirely inside z that touches z's boundary at a point p, and y as a shape that touches z at a different point q on z's boundary, and also extends into z to overlap with x. 

In this scenario, x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary (TPP), y touches z at the boundary (EC), and x and y share some interior points (PO). This seems to be a valid scenario, so TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me double-check the other possible relations as well:
1. DC(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y but doesn't touch x. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and extends to the right edge, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y at the same point where x touches the right edge of y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a rectangle, x as a circle that overlaps with most of y and extends beyond the right edge of y, and z as a circle that touches the right edge of y and overlaps with the part of x that extends beyond y. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

5. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle entirely inside x that touches x's boundary at a point p, and y as a shape that touches z at a point on z's boundary (possibly the same point p), and also extends into the interior of x without overlapping with z. This gives PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

All of these scenarios seem to be valid, so I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible. If x partially overlaps with y in a region away from where y touches z, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible. x can partially overlap with y and extend to touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts with z.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x can partially overlap with y and also extend beyond to share some interior parts with z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be entirely within z, touching z's boundary, while also partially overlapping with y (which touches z from the outside).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Impossible. If x is entirely in the interior of z without touching z's boundary, it cannot partially overlap with y since y only touches z at the boundary and doesn't share interior points with z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be entirely within x, touching x's boundary, while y touches z at the boundary and partially overlaps with x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Impossible. If z is entirely in the interior of x, then y (which touches z at the boundary) would be partially inside x's interior, making y either a proper part of x or vice versa, contradicting PO(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - Impossible. If x equals z, then y both partially overlaps with x and only externally connects with x, which is contradictory.
