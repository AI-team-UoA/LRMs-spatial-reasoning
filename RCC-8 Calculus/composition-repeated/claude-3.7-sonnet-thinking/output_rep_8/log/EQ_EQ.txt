PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We have that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

If x and y occupy exactly the same space, and y and z occupy exactly the same space, then x and z must also occupy exactly the same space.

So the relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

Let's verify this by considering the definitions of the relations again:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that x and y are coincident, and y and z are coincident. 

If x and y are coincident, then they occupy exactly the same space. And if y and z are coincident, then they also occupy exactly the same space. Therefore, x and z must also occupy exactly the same space, which means that EQ(x,z).

So the answer is EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), I need to determine the possible relationship between x and z.

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they also occupy exactly the same space.

If x is coincident with y, and y is coincident with z, then by transitivity, x must also be coincident with z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
