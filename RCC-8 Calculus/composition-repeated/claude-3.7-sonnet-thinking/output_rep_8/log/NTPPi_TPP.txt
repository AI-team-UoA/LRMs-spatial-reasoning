PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, I need to determine the possible spatial relations between regions $x$ and $z$ based on the given information:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, NTPP(y,x). So y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): This means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let me visualize these constraints:
- We have region y contained inside region x, not touching x's boundary.
- We have region y contained inside region z, and y touches z's boundary.

So we're trying to find the possible relations between x and z. Let me go through each of the 8 RCC-8 relations and check if they are possible:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This isn't possible because both x and y share at least the points in y, and y is part of z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But we know y is an interior part of both x and z, so they share interior parts. This isn't possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a part (which could be y), but neither is part of the other. This is potentially possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas, while they share y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is potentially possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is potentially possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is potentially possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible because y touches z's boundary, which means z has a boundary, and since y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, then z's boundary would have to be inside x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x. But we also know that y is inside z and y touches z's boundary, which would mean z's boundary would have to be inside y, which is a contradiction.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This is potentially possible if x and z are exactly the same region.

I think I've made a mistake. Let me reconsider the constraint "y touches z's boundary." This doesn't mean all of z's boundary is touched by y; it just means there's at least one point of contact.

So, let's reconsider:

1. DC(x,z): Still not possible because x and z share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because they share the interior part y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas, while they share y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Actually, this could be possible. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, but y does touch z's boundary, it's possible that z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
Actually, wait, that's not right. If y touches z's boundary, and y is completely inside x, then z's boundary is at least partially inside x. If z is completely inside x, then z's boundary is completely inside x. But that would mean z doesn't touch x's boundary, making it NTPPi(x,z). But there's no reason why z has to be completely inside x.

Let me think again. We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these, let's reconsider each relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because x and z share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because they share the interior part y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas, while they share y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This isn't possible. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's boundary is completely inside x. But we know that y touches z's boundary, so z's boundary must extend at least to y. And y doesn't touch x's boundary. But, considering that y is only a part of z, z could extend beyond y, possibly reaching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) would not be possible because if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then there's no way for y (which is inside z) to touch z's boundary without violating the conditions of NTPPi. The only way for y to touch z's boundary is if z's boundary is inside y, which would mean z is inside y, contradicting TPP(y,z).

Actually, I'm overthinking this. The condition TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If y is completely inside z, then z must extend beyond y. And if y touches z's boundary, then at least a part of z's boundary is adjacent to y.

Given these clarified conditions, let's reconsider:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because x and z share at least y.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible because they share the interior part y.
3. PO(x,z): Possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas, while they share y.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the reasons I explained earlier.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because TPP(y,z) implies z extends beyond y, while NTPPi(x,y) implies y is a proper part of x, so x extends beyond y. But if x and z were identical, they couldn't both extend beyond y in possibly different ways.

Actually, no. If we have EQ(x,z), that means x and z are identical regions. Given TPP(y,z), we know y is a tangential proper part of z, so y touches z's boundary. And given NTPPi(x,y), y is a non-tangential proper part of x (or equivalently, NTPP(y,x)), so y doesn't touch x's boundary. But if x and z are identical, then their boundaries are identical. So, y both touches and doesn't touch the same boundary, which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

But I'm actually not convinced that TPPi(x,z) should be on this list, because of the constraints. Let's carefully trace through what TPPi(x,z) would mean together with the given constraints:

TPPi(x,z) means z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

So, we have:
1. z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
2. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
3. y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

From 1 and 3, we know that z's boundary has at least one point in common with x's boundary (from 1) and at least one point in common with y (from 3). The points where z touches y are part of z's boundary, and these points are inside x (because y is inside x). The points where z touches x's boundary are also part of z's boundary.

But from 2, we know that y doesn't touch x's boundary. This means that the part of z's boundary that touches y is inside x and doesn't reach x's boundary.

There's no inherent contradiction here. It's possible for z to be entirely inside x (TPPi(x,z)), with y being inside z (TPP(y,z)) and touching z's boundary, while y doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me try to validate this with a visual reasoning. Consider a picture where x is a large circle, z is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, and y is an even smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary. This configuration satisfies all the given conditions:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
And in this picture, TPPi(x,z) holds: z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.

Actually, the more I think about this, the more I'm sure that TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility. And I'm now confident that all the other possibilities I listed are valid too.

Let me revisit the last relation I had questioned, EQ(x,z):

EQ(x,z) means x and z are identical regions.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

If x and z are identical, then:
1. y is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)).
2. y is entirely contained within z (which is the same as x) and touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)).

But these are contradictory: y cannot both touch and not touch the same boundary.

So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me ensure my logic is correct for the other possibilities:

For PO(x,z):
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- If x and z partially overlap, sharing y, but each extending beyond the other in some areas, this satisfies both conditions.

For TPP(x,z):
- If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is inside x not touching x's boundary, then y is also inside z. It's possible for y to touch z's boundary (as required by TPP(y,z)) while being completely inside x and not touching x's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
- If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is inside x not touching x's boundary, then y is also inside z. It's possible for y to touch z's boundary (as required by TPP(y,z)) while being completely inside x and not touching x's boundary. Actually, wait. I'm not sure if this is possible.

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) might not be possible. Let's think about it. If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then x's boundary is inside z. And if y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y's boundary is inside x. But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary. If y is inside x and x is inside z without touching z's boundary, it's hard to see how y could touch z's boundary.

Let me visualize this. If we have z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z without touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside x without touching x's boundary, it's not clear how y can touch z's boundary.

Actually, maybe this is possible if y stretches out to touch z's boundary while still being inside x. But then y would have to touch x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y).

I think I was confused. Let's think about it again: NTPP(x,z) means x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. TPP(y,z) means y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. So we have:
1. x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
2. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
3. y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

From 1 and 2, we know that y is inside z (because y is inside x and x is inside z), which is consistent with 3. But from 2, we know that y doesn't touch x's boundary, and from 1, we know that x doesn't touch z's boundary. So, y is inside x, which is inside z, with both boundaries (of x and z) not touching each other. How can y touch z's boundary? It seems like a contradiction.

I think the issue is that if y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y is also inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary. So, there's a contradiction.

NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

The only possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me think about this case again. I'm not sure if I'm reasoning through this correctly. Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

We're trying to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's systematically rule out the impossible relations:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But both contain y, so they can't be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But both contain y, so they definitely overlap. So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. Given that y is inside x and y is inside z, it's possible for x and z to overlap with y in the intersection, and for both x and z to extend beyond their intersection in some regions. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and y is inside z, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z. And it's also possible for x to touch z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary, if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y (being inside x) would be "shielded" from z's boundary by x. This makes it impossible for y to touch z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside z and y doesn't touch x's boundary, it's possible for z to be entirely inside x. And it's also possible for z to touch x's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is inside z and y touches z's boundary, if z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's boundary is entirely inside x. And since y touches z's boundary, y would be touching a boundary that is inside x but not x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside x and not touching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, but y is inside z and touches z's boundary, if x and z are identical, then y both touches and doesn't touch the same boundary, which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Wait, I think I've been making a mistake in my analysis of NTPP(x,z). Let me rethink this. 

If NTPP(x,z), then x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If NTPPi(x,y), then y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. From these, we can infer that y is entirely inside z (because y is inside x and x is inside z) and y doesn't touch z's boundary (because x doesn't touch z's boundary and y doesn't extend outside of x). But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary, which contradicts the inference. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, let me revisit NTPPi(x,z). If NTPPi(x,z), then z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. From these, we can infer that y is entirely inside x (because y is inside z and z is inside x) and y doesn't touch x's boundary (because z doesn't touch x's boundary). This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y), which says y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait, I made a mistake. Let me go step by step once more to be sure.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's analyze for NTPP(x,z):
- NTPP(x,z) means x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- From these, we can infer that y is entirely inside z (because y is inside x and x is inside z) and y doesn't touch z's boundary (because x doesn't touch z's boundary and y doesn't extend outside of x).
- But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary, which contradicts the inference.
- Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's analyze for NTPPi(x,z):
- NTPPi(x,z) means z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- From these, we can infer that y is entirely inside x (because y is inside z and z is inside x) and y doesn't touch x's boundary (because z doesn't touch x's boundary).
- This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y), which says y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- But there's an issue: If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y would be touching a boundary inside x that isn't x's boundary, which is consistent with y not touching x's boundary. So there's no contradiction here.
- Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

Let's analyze for TPP(x,z):
- TPP(x,z) means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- From these, we can infer that y is entirely inside z (because y is inside x and x is inside z). 
- And even though y doesn't touch x's boundary, x touches z's boundary, so it's possible for y to be inside x (not touching x's boundary) and for x to touch z's boundary in a way that y also touches z's boundary. This would mean that y reaches up to z's boundary in a part where x also touches z's boundary.
- Actually, no. If y doesn't touch x's boundary but touches z's boundary, and x touches z's boundary, there's a potential issue.
- If y touches z's boundary at a point where x also touches z's boundary, then y would touch x's boundary (since x and z share a boundary at that point), which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). So, in that case, TPP(x,z) wouldn't be possible.
- But if y touches z's boundary at a point where x doesn't touch z's boundary (which is possible because x might not touch z's boundary at all points), then there's no contradiction. TPP(x,z) is possible, but it has this specific constraint.

Ok, I think I've confused myself by overthinking. Let me revisit TPP(x,z):
- TPP(x,z) means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, TPP(x,z) means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, and NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. From these, we can infer that y is entirely inside z (because y is inside x and x is inside z).

The question is: Can y touch z's boundary (as required by TPP(y,z)) while still being inside x and not touching x's boundary? This might sound contradictory at first, but it's possible.

Consider this: x touches z's boundary, which means there's at least one point where x and z's boundaries meet. But x might not touch z's boundary at all points; there could be parts of z's boundary that aren't touched by x.

If y touches z's boundary at a point where x doesn't touch z's boundary, then there's no contradiction. It's possible for y to be inside x (not touching x's boundary) and to touch z's boundary at a point where x doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation, as long as y touches z's boundary at a point where x doesn't touch z's boundary.

Ok, let me take a deep breath, and do this one more time. 

I have NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), and I want to know what are the possible relations between x and z. I know from NTPPi(x,y) that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. I know from TPP(y,z) that y is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

Let's examine each RCC relation between x and z:

DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they would have no points in common. But both x and z contain y, so they have at least y in common. So DC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

EC(x,z): If x and z touch only at their boundaries, they would have no interior points in common. But both x and z contain y, so they have at least y's interior in common. So EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they would share some, but not all, of their interiors. Since both x and z contain y, they do share at least y's interior. And as long as neither is completely contained in the other, they would be in a PO relation. This seems possible.

TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, x would be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since y is inside x, y would also be inside z. The key question is: Can y touch z's boundary (as required by TPP(y,z)) while still being inside x and not touching x's boundary (as required by NTPPi(x,y))?

Let's visualize this. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside x and not touching x's boundary. The question is, can y also touch z's boundary? If y doesn't touch x's boundary, it's "shielded" from z's boundary by x wherever x and z's boundaries meet. But if there are parts of z's boundary that x doesn't touch, it's possible for y to extend to touch z's boundary at those parts while still being inside x.

I think that's not possible, because if y touches z's boundary, and x touches z's boundary, and y is inside x, then y would have to touch x's boundary. And as we established, y doesn't touch x's boundary. So the only way I can see for y to touch z's boundary while still being inside x and not touching x's boundary is if x doesn't touch z's boundary at all.

But TPP(x,z) specifically requires x to touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, I'm having a hard time visualizing this again. Let me rethink.

TPP(x,z) means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. From these, we can infer that y is entirely inside z (because y is inside x and x is inside z).

The question is whether y can touch z's boundary as required by TPP(y,z). If x touches z's boundary at every point, then there's no way for y to touch z's boundary without also touching x's boundary, which would contradict NTPPi(x,y). But x doesn't have to touch z's boundary at every point; it just needs to touch z's boundary at at least one point to satisfy TPP(x,z).

So, it's possible for x to touch z's boundary at some points, and for y to touch z's boundary at other points where x doesn't touch z's boundary. This would allow y to be inside x and not touch x's boundary, but still touch z's boundary.

To visualize this: Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary at one point, and y as an even smaller circle inside x but extending to touch z's boundary at a different point. This would satisfy all the given conditions.

So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, x would be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. Since y is inside x, y would also be inside z. But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, there's no way for y to reach and touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, z would be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. Since y is inside z, y would also be inside x. The key question is: Can y touch z's boundary (as required by TPP(y,z)) while still not touching x's boundary (as required by NTPPi(x,y))?

Again, let's visualize. Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside z. The question is, can y touch z's boundary while still not touching x's boundary? Yes, y can touch z's boundary at points where z doesn't touch x's boundary. If z only touches x's boundary at some points, there's room for y to touch z's boundary at other points while still being inside x and not touching x's boundary.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, z would be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. Since y is inside z, y would also be inside x and not touch x's boundary (because z doesn't touch x's boundary and y doesn't extend outside of z). This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). And TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary, which is possible since z's boundary is inside x and distinct from x's boundary.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

EQ(x,z): If x and z are identical, they have the same interior and boundary. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y would also be inside z and not touch z's boundary. But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary, which contradicts the previous inference. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, based on the systematic analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think I made a mistake earlier in my analysis of TPP(x,z). Let's re-examine it.

TPP(x,z) means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. TPP(y,z) means y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's visualize this. z is a large circle, x is a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary, and y is an even smaller circle inside x and not touching x's boundary. The question is, can y touch z's boundary as required by TPP(y,z)?

If y touches z's boundary, and y is inside x, then y must touch x's boundary at the point where x and z's boundaries meet (since that's the only way for y to reach z's boundary). But NTPPi(x,y) says y doesn't touch x's boundary, which creates a contradiction.

However, I was thinking too simplistically. If x touches z's boundary at only a subset of z's boundary, then y can touch z's boundary at a part where x and z's boundaries don't meet, and y can still remain inside x. This way, y would touch z's boundary but wouldn't touch x's boundary.

So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation, as long as x doesn't touch z's boundary at every point, and y touches z's boundary at a part where x doesn't.

Actually, I still think I am not thinking about this correctly. Let's try some diagrams.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). So y is inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, touches z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x is inside z, touches z's boundary.

For a point p, suppose p is in y. Then p is in x and p is in z.

For a point p on the boundary of y, p is in x (and not on the boundary of x because of NTPP(y,x)), and p might be on the boundary of z (because of TPP(y,z)).

For a point p on the boundary of x, p is not in y because of NTPP(y,x), but p might be on the boundary of z because of TPP(x,z).

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, while y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, I can't see how y could touch z's boundary, as required by TPP(y,z). The issue is that for y to touch z's boundary, y would have to extend to the edge of x (since x touches z's boundary), but that would mean y touches x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). So I don't think TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, wait. I'm think TPP(x,z) might be possible in a special case. If z has a region that's entirely inside x, and z's boundary has parts that are inside x and parts that touch x, then it's possible for y to touch the part of z's boundary that's inside x without touching x's boundary. I think that's a very special arrangement, but it's topologically possible.

So TPP(x,z) is possible, but in a specific scenario.

To recap, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double check by reasoning about some example configurations.

1. PO(x,z): Imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, with y as a small circle inside the overlap. Then y is inside both x and z. If y is positioned so that it touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, then all the given conditions are satisfied. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): I've been struggling with this. Let's try to describe a specific configuration. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary at just one point, and y as an even smaller circle inside x but positioned so that it touches z's boundary at a point where z's boundary dips inside x (but still doesn't touch x's boundary). This is a very specific and somewhat unusual configuration, but it's theoretically possible. So TPP(x,z) is possible, but in specific configurations.

Hmm, I think I'm struggling to conceptualize TPP(x,z) because of a mistaken understanding. Let's re-address it from scratch. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is entirely inside z, and x touches z's boundary. If we add NTPPi(x,y), which means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, we can infer that y is also entirely inside z. But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary. 

If y is entirely inside x (not touching x's boundary) and x touches z's boundary, how can y touch z's boundary? If z's boundary was always beyond x's boundary, and x only touches z's boundary at a few points, it wouldn't be possible for y to touch z's boundary.

But upon further reflection, it's possible to have a configuration where parts of z's boundary dip inside of x. This would be like a large circle (z) with a bay that extends into a smaller circle (x) touching the large circle. A very small circle (y) could be inside the smaller circle, away from the smaller circle's boundary, but touching the bay of the larger circle.

As strange as this would be, I think it fits all the relationships, as long as all regions are connected. Otherwise, we could easily create such scenarios by making x a set of disconnected regions, and have one sub-region of y touch the boundary of z in a different location from where y lies inside x.

That still strikes me as a strange pattern, and I'm not sure it's a valid configuration. But RCC-8 is a topological logic. So if some very complex arrangement of topological regions is plausible, I suppose it should satisfy TPP(x,z).

Let me again examine TPP(x,z) with the given conditions:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- TPP(x,z): x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given that y is inside x, y is inside z. Given that y doesn't touch x's boundary, for y to touch z's boundary, z's boundary would have to "dip" inside x. Or, put differently, there would need to be parts of z's boundary that are inside x.

Actually, I'm not sure what it would mean topologically for z's boundary to "dip" inside x. I think the rules make it impossible for TPP(x,z). y can touch z's boundary while inside x and not touching x's boundary, would require z to have a disconnected boundary, or maybe even y to be not connected?

Let me reconsider. I believe y is connected (a single piece), and we assume TPP(x,z), so x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Then y is also inside z because y is inside x. But for y to touch z's boundary, y would have to reach z's boundary, which means y would have to extend to the part of x that touches z's boundary. But if y extends to that part, y would also touch x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y).

So, I'm inclined to say that TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, I think my conceptualization of "touching" might be the issue. In the context of RCC-8, "touching" or "being tangential" doesn't necessarily mean having a boundary that physically touches another boundary. It means having a boundary that is close to another boundary in the limit.

Let's think of it in terms of open and closed sets. If region A is represented by an open set, then "touching" region B might mean that there's a point on the boundary of A's closure that's also on the boundary of B's closure. It doesn't mean that the open set A itself "touches" B.

In this view, if z is a region with a complex boundary that dips inside x, and y is a region inside x that approaches (in the limit) that dipping part of z's boundary, then y could be considered to "touch" z's boundary while still being entirely inside x and not touching x's boundary.

So, with this understanding, TPP(x,z) could be a possible relation.

Actually, I don't think I was mistaken about touching in RCC-8. I believe in RCC-8, "touching" does mean having boundaries that meet.

Maybe my understanding of "entirely inside x and not touching x's boundary", i.e., NTPPi(x,y) is wrong? Not "touching x's boundary" just means there's a positive amount of space between y and the boundary of x. But in that case, if y doesn't touch x's boundary, and x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then y can't touch z's boundary.

I think the issue is that RCC-8 is a topological calculus, and regions are not necessarily simple shapes like circles. So it's hard to visualize.

Regardless, I'm now almost certain that TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation. I think the following relations are the ones that are definitely possible:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. An example is just because both x and z contain y in their overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. An example is that z touches x's boundary, while y is inside z and touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. An example is that z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, while y is inside z and touches z's boundary (which is inside x).

Actually, let's revisit my definition of the RCC-8 relations. I believe TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. That means that x is entirely inside z, and x's boundary intersects z's boundary. That is, there are points that lie on both x's boundary and z's boundary.

Given that understanding, let's reconsider TPP(x,z) with the given conditions:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- TPP(x,z): x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, we have x inside z, y inside x, and y doesn't touch x's boundary. But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary, which means there's a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary. And since y is inside x, that point is inside x. But if z's boundary dips inside x, and y touches z's boundary at such a dipping point, it's possible for y to touch z's boundary without touching x's boundary. Thus, TPP(x,z) could be a possible relation.

So I've gone back and forth on this, but I suspect TPP(x,z) is a possible relation, given that RCC-8 allows for complex, non-convex regions. 

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I think it's time to conclude. I believe the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), I need to systematically evaluate each RCC-8 relation.

First, let me understand what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Now I'll check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because both x and z contain y, so they must share at least that region.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible because they share the interior region y, whereas EC requires they only touch at boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. They can partially overlap, with y in their shared region, while each extends beyond the other in some areas.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z and touch z's boundary, while y is inside x not touching x's boundary but still able to touch z's boundary (at a point where z's boundary dips into x's interior).

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (being inside x without touching x's boundary) would be unable to touch z's boundary as required by TPP(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary, while y is inside z and touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while y is inside z and touches z's boundary (which is interior to x).

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z were identical, then y would both touch and not touch the same boundary, which is contradictory.
