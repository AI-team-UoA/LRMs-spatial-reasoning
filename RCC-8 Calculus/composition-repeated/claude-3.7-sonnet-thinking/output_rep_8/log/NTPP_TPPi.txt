PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step-by-step. We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. This means that z is a tangential proper part of y, or in other words, TPP(z,y). So z is a proper part of y, and z touches y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think about the spatial configurations:

1. Since x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary, there are a few possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

   a. x and z could be completely disjoint (DC) if they don't share any points.
   b. x and z could touch at their boundaries (EC) if they share boundary points but no interior points.
   c. x and z could partially overlap (PO) if they share some interior points but neither is contained within the other.
   d. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP) if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   e. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP) if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   f. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi) if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   g. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi) if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   h. x and z could be equal (EQ) if they occupy exactly the same space.

Let's analyze each of these possibilities to see which are compatible with the given conditions:

a. DC(x,z): This means x and z are completely disjoint. This is possible since x is inside y, and z is a part of y that touches y's boundary. They could be in separate regions of y.

b. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if x is positioned in a way that it just touches z at the boundary.

c. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is contained within the other.

d. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. Given that x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and z is a proper part of y touching y's boundary (TPP(z,y)), it's possible that x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

e. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if z contains x entirely.

f. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary and x is completely inside y not touching y's boundary, it's not possible for z to be inside x and touching x's boundary. This is because if z touches y's boundary, and z is inside x, then x would also touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y).

g. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary, and if z is inside x, then x would also touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y). So this is not possible.

h. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are exactly the same. If x and z are the same, then z would not touch y's boundary (because x doesn't, as given by NTPP(x,y)), which contradicts TPP(z,y). So this is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, let me double check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) a bit more carefully. We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But we know that x doesn't touch y's boundary. If x touches z's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, it's possible that the part of z's boundary that x touches is not the part that touches y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me also reconsider PO(x,z). For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to partially overlap, meaning they share some interior points but neither is contained within the other. Given that x is completely inside y and z is a part of y that touches y's boundary, it's possible for x and z to partially overlap if z extends into the interior of y where x is located.

Let me also reconsider EC(x,z). For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. Given that x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z is a part of y that touches y's boundary, it's possible for x and z to just touch at their boundaries if z extends into the interior of y just far enough to touch x's boundary.

Let me reconsider DC(x,z). For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be completely disjoint. Given that x is inside y and z is a part of y that touches y's boundary, it's indeed possible for x and z to be disjoint if they are in separate regions of y.

Mmm, but I think I've been misinterpreting TPPi(y,z). TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. But I've been interpreting it as y is a tangential proper part of z, which is incorrect.

Let me redo my analysis with the correct interpretation:

We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is a proper part of y, and z touches y's boundary.

Actually, TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(y,z), which means y is a proper part of z and y touches z's boundary.

Let me correct my analysis again:

We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means TPP(z,y) is true. So y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is a proper part of z and y touches z's boundary.

No, I'm getting confused. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means TPP(z,y) is false. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(y,z) is true. So y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is a proper part of z and y touches z's boundary.

Let me trace through this one more time to clarify:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP, so it means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

No, that's not right either. Let me be precise:
- TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b.
- TPPi(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part inverse of b, which is the same as TPP(b,a). So TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a.

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

I think I got confused because I was second-guessing myself. Let me start fresh:

We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is a proper part of y and z touches y's boundary.

Ok, so my original analysis was correct. Let me go back to the possible relationships between x and z:

a. DC(x,z): Given that x is completely inside y and z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary, it's possible for x and z to be disjoint if they are in separate regions of y. So DC(x,z) is possible.

b. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. Given that x is completely inside y and z is a part of y that touches y's boundary, it's possible for x and z to just touch at their boundaries if z extends into the interior of y just far enough to touch x's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

c. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained within the other. Given that x is completely inside y and z is a part of y that touches y's boundary, it's possible for x and z to partially overlap if z extends into the interior of y where x is located. So PO(x,z) is possible.

d. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. Given that x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and z is a proper part of y touching y's boundary (TPP(z,y)), it's possible that x is inside z and touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

e. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if z contains x entirely. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

f. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary and x is completely inside y not touching y's boundary, it's not possible for z to be inside x and touching x's boundary. This is because if z touches y's boundary, and z is inside x, then x would also touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

g. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary, and if z is inside x, then x would also touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

h. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are exactly the same. If x and z are the same, then z would not touch y's boundary (because x doesn't, as given by NTPP(x,y)), which contradicts TPP(z,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, let me think a bit more about DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) to make sure I'm not missing anything. 

For DC(x,z), we know that x is completely inside y, and z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary. For x and z to be disconnected, they must not share any points. This is geometrically possible if y is large enough to contain both x and z such that they don't touch or overlap.

For EC(x,z), x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. This is also geometrically possible if x is positioned such that its boundary just touches z's boundary, but they don't overlap.

So, my conclusion stands:
The possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, let me ensure I'm interpreting these relations correctly one more time:

- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP, so it means TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y. z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let me double-check my reasoning for each possible relationship between x and z:

a. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, they share no points. Given that x is inside y and z is inside y, they could be in separate regions of y without touching. So DC(x,z) is possible.

b. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that x is inside y and z is inside y, they could be positioned such that they just touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

c. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained within the other. Given that x is inside y and z is inside y, they could overlap partially. So PO(x,z) is possible.

d. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that x is inside y and z is inside y, it's possible for x to be inside z and touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

e. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that x is inside y and z is inside y, it's possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

f. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But if z is inside x, and z touches y's boundary (as given by TPP(z,y)), then x would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

g. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But if z is inside x, and z touches y's boundary (as given by TPP(z,y)), then x would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

h. EQ(x,z): x and z are exactly the same. If they are the same, then z would not touch y's boundary (because x doesn't, as given by NTPP(x,y)), which contradicts TPP(z,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Alright, I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me check my understanding of NTPP and TPP once more:

- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

And for TPPi and NTPPi:

- TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x). So y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

With this understanding, let's reanalyze the given conditions:

- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Ok, now I'm not so sure I had the right interpretation of TPPi(y,z). 

Let's be clear: TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y) is false. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(y,z) is true, which means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let me rethink the possible relationships between x and z:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

From this, we can derive:
- x is inside y, which is inside z. So, x is inside z transitively.
- y touches z's boundary, but x doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, x is inside z, and the question is whether x touches z's boundary. If x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, can x touch z's boundary?

Given that y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), it means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), it means x is separated from the boundary of y by some distance. Since y touches z's boundary at some points, and x is inside y but not touching y's boundary, it's not possible for x to touch z's boundary. x is effectively insulated from z's boundary by the region of y that doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully:

- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x is inside y and y is inside z, then x is inside z (this is a transitive property). Now, can x touch z's boundary? If x touches z's boundary, it would mean there's a point on the boundary of x that also lies on the boundary of z. But given that x doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), it means all of x, including its boundary, is inside y (not just inside, but away from y's boundary). And if y touches z's boundary, it means there's a point on the boundary of y that also lies on the boundary of z. But since x is fully inside y (away from y's boundary), it cannot reach the boundary of z. So, x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, I made a mistake. Let me clarify with a geometric perspective.

Imagine y as a smaller circle inside a larger circle z, touching z's boundary at a point. Now, imagine x as an even smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary. In this scenario, x is completely inside y, which is inside z. So, x is inside z. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, x is separated from z's boundary by some distance.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me draw it out more carefully. 

Imagine y as a circle touching the inside of circle z, and x as a circle inside y, not touching y. 

```
       z
      /  \
     /    \
    |  y   |
    |  /\  |
    | |x | |
    |  \/  |
     \    /
      \__/
```

In this illustration, x is inside y, which is inside z. The boundary of y touches the boundary of z at a point. The boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of y. Given this, it's clear that x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let's check if there are any other possible configurations given the conditions:

- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x is inside y (not touching y's boundary), then x is inside z and cannot touch z's boundary because it's separated from z's boundary by the region of y that doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let's ensure I'm considering all possibilities.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

I concluded that x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z). But let me double-check by considering the other possible relationships:

a. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But if x is inside y and y is inside z, then x is inside z. So x and z cannot be disconnected, which means DC(x,z) is not possible.

b. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But if x is inside y and y is inside z, then x is inside z. So x and z cannot just touch at their boundaries, which means EC(x,z) is not possible.

c. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. But if x is inside y and y is inside z, then x is completely inside z, not just partially. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

d. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But as I reasoned earlier, if x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

e. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with our reasoning. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

f. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. But if y is inside z and x is inside y, then z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

g. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But if y is inside z and x is inside y, then z cannot be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

h. EQ(x,z): x and z are exactly the same. But if x is inside y and y is inside z, then x is inside z, not the same as z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me check if TPP(x,z) is truly not possible by drawing it out.

Imagine y as a shape inside z, touching z's boundary. Now, imagine x inside y, not touching y's boundary. Can x touch z's boundary? If x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x is separated from z's boundary by the region of y that doesn't touch y's boundary. So, x cannot touch z's boundary.

However, I need to be careful about the definition of TPP. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary, can x touch z's boundary?

Let me visualize with a more complex shape. If y is a crescent moon shape inside z, touching z's boundary at one end, and x is a small circle inside the crescent but not touching the crescent's boundary, can x touch z's boundary? No, because x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, it's separated from z's boundary by the region of y.

So, my conclusion stands: the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me be completely clear. NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely inside y.
- x does not touch the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a tangential proper part of z.
- y is inside z.
- y touches the boundary of z.

Given these:
- x is inside y, which is inside z. So, x is inside z.
- x is away from the boundary of y, and y is touching the boundary of z. This means there's a distance between x and the boundary of z. So, x does not touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me think about the transitivity of these relations more carefully.

If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

From NTPP(x,y), we know x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary. From TPP(y,z), we know y is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since x is inside y, which is inside z, x is inside z. But can x touch z's boundary?

If x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, there's a gap between x and z's boundary. This is because the boundary of y creates a buffer between x and the boundary of z. Given that x doesn't even touch y's boundary, it definitely cannot touch z's boundary, which is beyond y's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But the question is: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y) is false. It means y is a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(y,z) is true. This means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z):
- x is inside y, away from y's boundary.
- y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

By transitivity, x is inside z. But since x is away from y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, x is away from z's boundary. So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me just make sure one last time. I think I've confirmed that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, no, let me just double check once more to make sure, using another illustration.

Imagine a scenario where y is a circle that touches the boundary of z, and x is a circle inside y that doesn't touch y's boundary. 

```
       z
      /  \
     /    \
    |      |
    |  y   |
    | /|\ |->  Contact point between y and z
    ||x|  |
    | \|/ |
    |      |
     \    /
      \__/
```

In this illustration, y touches the boundary of z at one point. x is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary. Given this, x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I'm now confident that the only possible relationship between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is that x and z have a Non-Tangential Proper Part (NTPP) relationship, specifically NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I've interpreted TPPi correctly.

The problem statement defined TPPi(x,y) as the same as TPP(y,x). This means TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

But this contradicts what I've been assuming. I've been assuming TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, or TPP(y,z).

Let me reconsider.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

With this understanding, let's rethink the possible relationships between x and z:

Now, we have x inside y, and z also inside y. Both x and z are inside y, but they could be in different regions of y. The relationship between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations, depending on their relative positions inside y.

a. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. If x and z are in different regions of y, not touching or overlapping, then DC(x,z) is possible.

b. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. If x and z are positioned such that they just touch at their boundaries inside y, then EC(x,z) is possible.

c. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. If x and z overlap but neither is completely inside the other, then PO(x,z) is possible.

d. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

e. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

f. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

g. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

h. EQ(x,z): x and z are exactly the same. If x and z occupy the same space, then EQ(x,z) is possible.

However, there's another condition: z touches y's boundary (TPP(z,y)). And x doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)). 

Let's reconsider the possibilities:

a. DC(x,z): This is possible. x and z can be in different regions of y, with z touching y's boundary and x away from y's boundary.

b. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and z can be positioned such that they just touch at their boundaries, with z also touching y's boundary and x away from y's boundary.

c. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can overlap, with z also touching y's boundary and x away from y's boundary.

d. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be inside z, touching z's boundary, with z also touching y's boundary and x away from y's boundary.

e. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be inside z, not touching z's boundary, with z touching y's boundary.

f. TPPi(x,z): If z is inside x, then z cannot touch y's boundary if x doesn't. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

g. NTPPi(x,z): If z is inside x and away from x's boundary, then z cannot touch y's boundary if x doesn't. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

h. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same, then z cannot touch y's boundary if x doesn't. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Alright, let's visualize these possibilities:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
```
      y
     / \
    |   |
    |x  z>  Contact point between z and y
    |   |
     \ /
```

EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
```
      y
     / \
    |   |
    |x--z>  Contact point between z and y
    |   |
     \ /
```

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
```
      y
     / \
    |   |
    |xx |
    |xzz|>  Contact point between z and y
    |zz |
     \ /
```

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
```
      y
     / \
    |   |
    | z  |>  Contact point between z and y
    ||x| |
    | --- |
     \ /
```

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
```
      y
     / \
    |   |
    | z  |>  Contact point between z and y
    | |x||
    | --- |
     \ /
```

These visualizations confirm that the possible relationships between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I'm getting confused by the definition of TPPi. The problem statement states that TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). So TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

On reflection, I think that's correct and matches what I was assuming earlier. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, or TPP(z,y). It means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y):
- x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

The relationship between x and z depends on their relative positions inside y. If they are in different parts of y, they can be DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP. However, given the condition that z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, z cannot be inside x, which rules out TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Additionally, x and z cannot be the same, which rules out EQ(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me triple check the problem definition. The problem states that TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y):
- x is inside y, away from y's boundary.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

I've already analyzed the possible relationships between x and z and found that DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP are possible.

Actually, to be thorough, let me perform a consistency check for each of the 8 RCC-8 relations to see which are compatible with the given conditions.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y, away from y's boundary.
- TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

For each of the 8 RCC-8 relations, let's see if they are consistent with the given conditions:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. If x and z are in different regions of y, not touching or overlapping, then DC(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. If x and z are positioned such that they just touch at their boundaries inside y, then EC(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. If x and z overlap but neither is completely inside the other, then PO(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions.

4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If z extends inside y such that x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If z extends inside y such that x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If z is inside x, it can't touch y's boundary if x doesn't touch y's boundary. This is inconsistent with TPP(z,y), which says z touches y's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is not consistent with the given conditions.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is inside x, it can't touch y's boundary if x doesn't touch y's boundary. This is inconsistent with TPP(z,y), which says z touches y's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not consistent with the given conditions.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then z wouldn't touch y's boundary (because x doesn't). This is inconsistent with TPP(z,y), which says z touches y's boundary. So, EQ(x,z) is not consistent with the given conditions.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, let me double check that TPP(x,z) is possible. Given that x doesn't touch y's boundary, we know there is some distance between x and the boundary of y. But if z touches y's boundary, and if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x touches z's boundary. Can this be consistent with x not touching y's boundary?

Yes, it's possible for x to touch z's boundary at a point that's not on y's boundary. Imagine z as a shape that touches y's boundary at some point, and x is inside z, touching z's boundary but away from y's boundary.

```
      y
     / \
    |   |
    | z  |>  Contact point between z and y
    ||x\ |
    ||_/||
    |    |
     \ /
```

In this illustration, z touches y's boundary at one point. x is inside z and touches z's boundary, but is away from y's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions.

So, my answer is confirmed. The possible relationships between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me re-check the problem to be 100% sure.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. x is inside y, away from y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

I've determined that the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP. I can visualize each of these:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Both are inside y, but they don't touch or overlap. z touches y's boundary.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Both are inside y, and z touches y's boundary.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Both are inside y, and z touches y's boundary.

TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary. z is inside y and touches y's boundary. x doesn't touch y's boundary.

NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. z is inside y and touches y's boundary. x doesn't touch y's boundary.

These are all consistent with the given conditions.

So, the answer is: the possible relationships between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and touches y's boundary

Given these conditions, both x and z are inside y, but with different relationships to y's boundary. Let me consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected if they are in different regions of y without touching
2. EC(x,z): x and z can externally connect if they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap if they share some interior points but neither is contained in the other
4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z if x is inside z and touches z's boundary
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary

The remaining relations are not possible:
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z): These would require z to be inside x, but since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, this creates a contradiction
- EQ(x,z): If x and z were identical, they couldn't have different relationships with y's boundary
