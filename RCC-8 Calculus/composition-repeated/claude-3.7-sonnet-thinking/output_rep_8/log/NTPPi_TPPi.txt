PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step, reasoning about the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's recall the definitions of NTPPi and TPPi:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is contained within y (TPP(z,y)), and y is contained within x (NTPP(y,x)), we know that z is also contained within x by transitivity of containment.

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

We know that z touches the boundary of y, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means that z can't touch the boundary of x through y.

Therefore, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
3. Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is also inside x.
4. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z can't touch x's boundary.
5. Therefore, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me re-evaluate this. I need to be careful about the direction of the relations.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is contained within y, and y is contained within x, z must be contained within x by transitivity.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x?

We know that z touches the boundary of y, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This means z cannot reach the boundary of x. Therefore, z must be completely inside x without touching its boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm being careless with the directions. Let me be more precise:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
- y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given these constraints, z is contained within y, which is contained within x, so z is contained within x.

Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z can't touch x's boundary either.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think more carefully. I need to make sure that I'm interpreting the directions of the relations correctly.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. (from NTPPi(x,y))
- z is contained within y and touches y's boundary. (from TPPi(y,z))

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

z is contained within y, which is contained within x, so z is contained within x by transitivity.

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not. We know that z touches the boundary of y, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means that z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

OK, so my final answer is that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently, NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I realize we need to be even more careful. The question is asking for the possible relationships between x and z, which means there might be multiple possibilities. Let me think more systematically.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

From these, we can deduce:
- z is contained within y, which is contained within x, so z is contained within x.
- y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, so z can't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me once more reconsider. I believe the issue might be that I'm being too restrictive in my interpretation.

Let's start with:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

From these, we can deduce:
- z is contained within y, which is contained within x, so z is contained within x.

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not. We know that z touches the boundary of y, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means that z cannot touch the boundary of x through the part of y's boundary that z touches.

But wait, if z is inside y, and y is strictly inside x, then z must be strictly inside x as well. So z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

My mistake might have been in thinking that there are multiple possible relationships between x and z, but given the constraints, there's only one: NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, there could be other possibilities I'm not considering. Let me approach this differently.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z is inside y, which is inside x, so z must be inside x as well.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is not possible because y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z is inside y, so z can't touch the boundary of x.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is not possible because z is completely inside y, which is completely inside x, so z must be completely inside x.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because x contains y, which contains z, so x must contain z, not the other way around.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z is inside y, so z can't touch the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with our constraints: z is inside y, which is inside x without touching x's boundary, so z is inside x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because z is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of x, so z must be a proper part of x, not equal to x.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently, NTPP(z,x).

Hm, let's reason about this from a different angle to make sure.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these, what can we say about z's position relative to x?

z is inside y, which is inside x, so z is inside x.

Now, can z touch x's boundary? We know that z touches y's boundary, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This means that there's some "buffer" between y's boundary and x's boundary. Since z is inside y and can at most touch y's boundary, z cannot reach beyond y to touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I'm confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently, NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me think if I can translate this into a geometric scenario to check. 

Imagine:
- x is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z is an even smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.

In this scenario, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x).

Let me try another configuration to see if there's any other possibility:

- x is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z is an even smaller shape inside y that touches y's boundary at one or more points.

Again, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x).

I can't think of a valid configuration where z has a different relationship with x given the constraints. Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize I need to be a bit more careful here. 

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

It's important to clarify: when we say "z touches y's boundary," it means z has some part that is coincident with y's boundary. But this doesn't mean that z is entirely contained within y's boundary.

Let's consider a few possibilities:

1. z is a small circle completely inside y, touching y's boundary at one point. In this case, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

2. z is a larger shape that overlaps with y and has some parts outside of y. This violates the TPPi(y,z) constraint, which requires z to be inside y.

3. z is a larger shape that contains y and has some parts outside of y. This also violates the TPPi(y,z) constraint.

4. z is an irregular shape inside y that touches y's boundary at one or more points. As long as z is completely inside y, it must also be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Given the constraints, all valid configurations lead to NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I'm satisfied now.  The answer is NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, let me be careful again. 

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given the above definitions of TPPi(y,z) and applying the definition of TPP as the inverse of TPPi: TPP(z,y) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means that z is completely inside y, and touches the boundary of y.

Now, given that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y) or equivalently NTPP(y,x)), and z is completely inside y (from TPP(z,y)), we can deduce that z is also completely inside x by transitivity.

Does z touch the boundary of x? Since y doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPP(y,x)), and z is inside y, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me do one more check.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

We've established that z is inside x. The question is whether z can touch x's boundary.

If z were to touch x's boundary, then there would be a point p such that p is on the boundary of x and also in z. Since z is inside y, p must also be in y. But this contradicts the fact that y doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, z cannot touch x's boundary.

So, z is inside x without touching x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I'm satisfied that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me double-check with another example. 

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let's say x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is an even smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at one point.

In this scenario, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I can't think of a valid configuration where z has a different relationship with x given the constraints. Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x).

But wait. I need to consider all of the possibilities systematically.

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)). This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. There are multiple ways z can touch y's boundary:

1. z could be a small circle inside y, touching y's boundary at a single point.
2. z could be an irregular shape inside y, touching y's boundary at multiple points.
3. z could be a shape that "follows" y's boundary, touching it at many points.

And there are multiple ways x can contain y, given NTPPi(x,y):

1. x could be a larger circle with y inside, not touching x's boundary.
2. x could be an irregular shape with y inside, not touching x's boundary.

But in all cases, since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z must also not touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is inside x without touching x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be careful about the definition of "inside." When we say "y is inside x," we mean that y is a proper part of x, not necessarily that y is surrounded by x.

Let's be precise about the definitions:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x and does not overlap with the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y and overlaps with the boundary of y.

Given these, we know:
- y is a proper part of x and doesn't overlap with x's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y and overlaps with y's boundary.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, by transitivity, z is a proper part of x.

Now, the question is whether z overlaps with the boundary of x. We know that z overlaps with the boundary of y, but y doesn't overlap with the boundary of x. This means that the boundary of y is inside x, not on the boundary of x. Since z can at most overlap with the boundary of y, z cannot overlap with the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a proper part of x and doesn't overlap with x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x).

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more precise in my reasoning.

In RCC-8:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means all of y is inside x, including y's boundary, and y's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means all of z is inside y, and some part of z's boundary touches y's boundary.

Given these, we know:
- All of y is inside x, and y's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary.
- All of z is inside y, and some part of z's boundary touches y's boundary.

From the above, we can deduce:
- All of z is inside y, which is inside x, so all of z is inside x by transitivity.
- z's boundary touches y's boundary, but y's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. This means z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, all of z is inside x, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I need to double check I'm not confusing the direction of the relation. 

NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So the relationship between x and z is that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x). But the relation from x to z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which is equivalent to saying that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to reason through this one more time carefully. Let's double-check that I'm getting the direction of the relations correct.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): NTPP(y,x). This means y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): TPP(z,y). This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, I want to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, z is inside x by transitivity.

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x. We know that z touches the boundary of y, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means that the boundary of y is strictly inside x. Since z can at most touch the boundary of y, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is inside x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident that the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

Let me determine the possible relationships between x and z based on the given conditions:

1) NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This tells us y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

2) TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This tells us z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

From these conditions:
- Since z is inside y (from TPPi(y,z))
- And y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y))
- Therefore z must be inside x by transitivity

Can z touch x's boundary? No, because:
- z can at most touch y's boundary (from TPPi(y,z))
- y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y))
- Therefore z cannot reach x's boundary

Since z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, the only possible relationship is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
