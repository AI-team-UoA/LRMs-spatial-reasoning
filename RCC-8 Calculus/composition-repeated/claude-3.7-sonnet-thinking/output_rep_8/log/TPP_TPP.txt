PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze this scenario.

We have the following:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now we need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Since x is part of y (from TPP(x,y)), and y is part of z (from TPP(y,z)), we know that x is definitely part of z by transitivity of the part-of relation. 

So x is part of z, but we need to determine whether:
1. x touches z's boundary (making it TPP(x,z))
2. x is completely inside z without touching its boundary (making it NTPP(x,z))

Since TPP(x,y), x touches y's boundary. And since TPP(y,z), y touches z's boundary.

When x touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, there are two possibilities:
1. The point where x touches y's boundary is also where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x would also touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) true.
2. The point where x touches y's boundary is not where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x would be completely inside z, making NTPP(x,z) true.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check this by thinking about concrete examples:

Example 1: Imagine three concentric circles, where x is the innermost circle, y is the middle circle, and z is the outermost circle. If x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z at the same point, then x would also touch the boundary of z. This gives us TPP(x,z).

Example 2: Imagine three nested circles where x touches y's boundary at some point, but y touches z's boundary at a different point. In this case, x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This gives us NTPP(x,z).

So I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Analysis:
Since x is part of y and y is part of z, we know x must be part of z (by transitivity).

There are two possibilities for how x relates to z's boundary:

1. If x touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, giving us TPP(x,z).

2. If x touches y's boundary at a different point than where y touches z's boundary, then x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, giving us NTPP(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible given the constraints.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
