PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, I'll recall the definitions of these relations:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints.

From PO(x,y), we know:
- x and y share some spatial part
- x is not fully contained in y
- y is not fully contained in x

From TPP(y,z), we know:
- y is fully contained in z
- y touches the boundary of z

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's analyze the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? 
   Since y is part of z and x shares a part with y, x must also share a part with z. So x and z cannot be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
   Since x shares interior parts with y (from PO(x,y)), and y is contained in z, it seems that x must share some interior parts with z as well. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful. From PO(x,y), x and y share some interior parts. But if the part of x that overlaps with y is entirely within the part of y that touches z's boundary, then x might only touch z's boundary without sharing interior parts. So EC(x,z) could be possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some spatial part, but neither is contained in the other.
   Since x shares parts with y, and y is contained in z, x must share parts with z. Also, since x is not contained in y (from PO(x,y)), and y is contained in z, x is not necessarily contained in z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
   It's possible that x is entirely contained within z. And since x overlaps with y, and y touches z's boundary, x might also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
   It's possible that x is entirely contained within z without touching its boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
   Since y is part of z, and y is not fully contained in x (from PO(x,y)), z cannot be fully contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
   Similar to TPPi, since y is part of z and y is not fully contained in x, z cannot be fully contained in x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same.
   Since y is part of z but not part of x (from PO(x,y)), x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double check this reasoning with a different approach.

From PO(x,y), we have a part of x overlapping with y, and parts of x that don't overlap with y. From TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. 

So, the part of x that overlaps with y is definitely within z. The parts of x that don't overlap with y could be:
- outside of z, making x and z have a partial overlap (PO)
- touching z's boundary from inside, making x a tangential proper part of z (TPP)
- entirely inside z without touching its boundary, making x a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)
- touching z's boundary from outside, making x and z externally connected (EC)

I'm not entirely confident about EC(x,z). Let me think about it more carefully.

Actually, yes, EC(x,z) is possible. Imagine x and y sharing a small part, and the rest of x being outside of y and z, with x only touching z at the boundary. In this case, x and z would be externally connected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me be a little more careful with the case of EC(x,z). I said earlier that EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

From PO(x,y), we know that x and y share interior parts. And from TPP(y,z), we know that y is inside z. This means that the interior parts that x shares with y are also interior parts of z. So x and z must share interior parts, which contradicts the definition of EC(x,z).

So, I was mistaken. EC(x,z) is not possible.

Correcting my answer:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, but I'm having second thoughts about my reasoning for EC(x,z). Let me try to use a concrete example to clarify.

Imagine:
- y is a square
- z is a larger square containing y, with y touching the boundary of z
- x is a rectangle that partially overlaps with y (satisfying PO(x,y)) but doesn't extend beyond the boundary of z

In this case, x would be partially overlapping with z (PO(x,z)).

Now, imagine:
- y is a square
- z is a larger square containing y, with y touching the boundary of z
- x is a small square completely inside z, overlapping with part of y but not contained in y

In this case, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

And imagine:
- y is a square
- z is a larger square containing y, with y touching the boundary of z
- x is a rectangle that partially overlaps with y and also touches the boundary of z

In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

I'm still not sure about EC(x,z). Let me try to construct an example where x and z are externally connected.

Actually, I was right initially. EC(x,z) is not possible. The reason is as follows:
From PO(x,y), x and y share interior parts. From TPP(y,z), y is inside z. So, the interior parts that x shares with y are also interior parts of z. This means x and z must share interior parts, which contradicts the definition of EC(x,z).

Wait, I'm struggling with this. Let me try one more approach.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some region, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's consider the possibilities for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z have no parts in common. But since x shares parts with y, and y is inside z, x must share some parts with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since x shares interior parts with y, and y is inside z, x must share interior parts with z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share some parts, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x could extend beyond z, making it a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. x shares parts with y, and y touches z's boundary, so x could also touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is also possible. x shares parts with y, which is inside z, but x might not extend to z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since y is inside z, and y shares parts with x but is not inside x, z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. Since y is inside z, and y is not inside x (they partially overlap), x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, wait a minute. I'm forgetting something about the definition of PO. Let me check that.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

So, x and y share a spatial part, but neither is a proper part of the other.

From PO(x,y), we know that x and y share interior parts, but neither is a subset of the other. 
From TPP(y,z), we know that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's revisit the possibilities for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z have no parts in common. But since x shares parts with y, and y is inside z, x must share some parts with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since x shares interior parts with y, and y is inside z, x must share interior parts with z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share some parts, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x could extend beyond z, making it a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. x shares parts with y, and y touches z's boundary, so x could also touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is also possible. x shares parts with y, which is inside z, but x might not extend to z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since y is inside z, and y shares parts with x but is not inside x, z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. Since y is inside z, and y is not inside x (they partially overlap), x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Alright, I think my reasoning is consistent now.

The answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me make sure with some concrete examples:

1. PO(x,z): 
   - Imagine y is a small square.
   - z is a larger square containing y, with y touching the boundary of z.
   - x is a rectangle that partially overlaps with y but also extends beyond the boundary of z.
   In this case, x partially overlaps with z.

2. TPP(x,z): 
   - Imagine y is a small square.
   - z is a larger square containing y, with y touching the boundary of z.
   - x is a rectangle that partially overlaps with y, is completely inside z, and touches the boundary of z.
   In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z.

3. NTPP(x,z): 
   - Imagine y is a small square.
   - z is a larger square containing y, with y touching the boundary of z.
   - x is a small square that partially overlaps with y, is completely inside z, but doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

But wait, I think I've been hasty in my analysis. Let me approach this more systematically.

When we say TPP(y,z), it means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

When we say PO(x,y), it means x and y share some parts, but neither is a subset of the other. 

Given these, can x and z be externally connected (EC)?

Ah, I think I've been overthinking this. In the case of EC(x,z), x and z would touch only at their boundaries. But since x shares interior parts with y, and y is inside z, x must share interior parts with z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let's double check all of the possibilities one more time:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because x shares parts with y, and y is inside z, so x must share parts with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because x shares interior parts with y, and y is inside z, so x must share interior parts with z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x could extend beyond z, making it a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x shares parts with y, and if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x shares parts with y, and if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): Not possible. Since y is inside z, and y shares parts with x but is not inside x, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): Not possible. For the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside z, and y is not inside x (they partially overlap), x and z cannot be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Ok, I think we're getting confused with terminology. Let me be more precise. 

PO(x,y) means that x and y have a common interior part (they overlap), but neither is a proper part of the other.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z, and y shares a boundary point with z.

Given these, can we have EC(x,z)? 

Let's think about this geometrically. If x and y share an interior part (because of PO), and y is inside z (because of TPP), then that shared interior part of x and y is also inside z. This means x and z share an interior part, which contradicts EC(x,z).

Actually, let me think again. Actually EC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

The reason is that for EC(x,z) to hold, x and z should touch only at their boundaries. But since PO(x,y), x and y share interior parts. And since TPP(y,z), y is inside z. This means the interior parts that x shares with y are also inside z, so x and z share interior parts. This contradicts EC(x,z).

Let me list out all the possible relations again and think step by step.

PO(x,y) means x and y share interior parts, but neither is a proper part of the other.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z, and y shares a boundary point with z.

Given these:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because x shares interior parts with y, and y is inside z, so x must share interior parts with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because, as explained above, x and z must share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x could extend beyond z, making it a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): Not possible. Since y is inside z, and y shares parts with x but is not inside x, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): Not possible. For the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside z, and y is not inside x (they partially overlap), x and z cannot be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me reconsider the case of EC(x,z), because I made a potentially misleading statement.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch only at their boundaries. For this to be true, x and z shouldn't share any interior parts.

From PO(x,y), we know x and y share interior parts.
From TPP(y,z), we know y is inside z.

If x and y share interior parts, and y is inside z, then the interior parts that x shares with y are also inside z. This means x and z share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

OK I think I've been correct all along.

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because x shares interior parts with y, and y is inside z, so x must share interior parts with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because x shares interior parts with y, and y is inside z, so x and z must share interior parts, which contradicts EC.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x could extend beyond z, making it a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): Not possible. Since y is inside z, and y shares parts with x but is not inside x, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): Not possible. For the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside z, and y is not inside x (they partially overlap), x and z cannot be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

OK final answer. If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations can hold between x and z given that PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

From PO(x,y), I know:
- x and y share some interior parts
- Neither x nor y is completely part of the other

From TPP(y,z), I know:
- y is completely contained in z
- y touches z's boundary

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x shares interior parts with y, and y is inside z, x must share some interior with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason - x must share interior parts with z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. The parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, but x could extend beyond z's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside z and shares parts with x but is not inside x, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside z but not inside x, x and z cannot be equal.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
