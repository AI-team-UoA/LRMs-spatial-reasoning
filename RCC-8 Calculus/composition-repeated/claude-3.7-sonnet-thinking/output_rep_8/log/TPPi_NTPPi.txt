PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Now, we need to find the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let's think through this:
- y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y) or TPP(y,x))
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y))

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is a part of y (NTPP(z,y)), and y is a part of x (TPP(y,x)), then z is definitely a part of x by transitivity. 

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not. 

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)), z doesn't touch the boundary of y. And since y is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(y,x)), y touches the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, z can't touch the boundary of x either. Therefore, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me double-check this. It's possible that there are cases where z could touch the boundary of x, even if it doesn't touch the boundary of y. Let me think about this more carefully.

Actually, I realize I need to be more precise. 

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. y is a proper part of x (all points in y are also in x, but not all points in x are in y).
2. y touches the boundary of x (there's at least one point of y that's also on the boundary of x).

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. z is a proper part of y (all points in z are also in y, but not all points in y are in z).
2. z does not touch the boundary of y (no point of z is on the boundary of y).

Given these constraints, we know that:
- z is a proper part of y.
- y is a proper part of x.
- Therefore, z is a proper part of x by transitivity.

Now, the key question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(z,y)), and y may or may not touch the boundary of x at various points, it's not immediately clear if z touches the boundary of x.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. Imagine y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x at certain points. But z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. Given these constraints, z is entirely inside y, and y's boundary may or may not coincide with x's boundary at certain points. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y's boundary is the only part of y that could potentially touch x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x).

Hmm, actually, I'm realizing that the statement "y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x at certain points" doesn't quite capture the full meaning of TPP(y,x). Let me try again.

TPP(y,x) means:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. y touches the boundary of x (there's at least one point of y that's also on the boundary of x).

NTPP(z,y) means:
1. z is a proper part of y.
2. z does not touch the boundary of y (no point of z is on the boundary of y).

Given these constraints, we know that:
- z is strictly inside y (since it doesn't touch y's boundary).
- y is inside x but may touch x's boundary at certain points.

Since z is strictly inside y, and y may or may not touch the boundary of x, it follows that z is strictly inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I'm realizing that there's another dimension to this problem. Let me consider more carefully.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). This means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

From these, we can derive:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. z is a proper part of y.
3. Therefore, z is a proper part of x.

The question is: Is z a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x?

For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to touch the boundary of x. But given that z doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(z,y)), and y is the only bridge between z and the boundary of x, it seems that z would not touch the boundary of x.

Actually, let me carefully draw out the conditions:

1. TPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
2. NTPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only conduit between z and the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I should double-check this. Let's try to find a counterexample where z could be a tangential proper part of x. I'm trying to imagine a scenario where:
- y is a tangential proper part of x.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- But somehow, z touches the boundary of x.

It's hard to visualize such a scenario because if z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only bridge between z and the boundary of x, then z would not touch the boundary of x.

Let me try a more concrete example. Imagine:
- x is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at one point.
- z is an even smaller circle inside y, but not touching the boundary of y.

In this scenario, z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a tangential proper part of x. But z doesn't touch the boundary of x, so z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I'm satisfied with the conclusion. The relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just double check that there isn't another possibility. 

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We know that:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. z is a proper part of y.
3. Therefore, z is a proper part of x.

We've established that z cannot touch the boundary of x (given the constraints), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Are there any other possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z? 

DC (disconnected): Not possible because z is a part of x.
EC (externally connected): Not possible because z is a part of x.
PO (partially overlapping): Not possible because z is a part of x.
TPP (tangential proper part): We've just discussed why this isn't possible; z cannot touch the boundary of x.
NTPP (non-tangential proper part): This is the relationship we've identified.
TPPi (inverse of TPP): Not possible because z is a part of x, not the other way around.
NTPPi (inverse of NTPP): Not possible because z is a part of x, not the other way around.
EQ (equal): Not possible because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is definitely a proper part of x, not equal to it.

So, the only possible RCC-8 relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Let me actually make sure I've got the direction of the relationship correct. NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), so NTPPi(x,z) also means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given the notation in the problem, where TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), it seems the notation expects the first argument to be the containing region and the second argument to be the contained region. So, the answer should be NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me revisit the original problem statement to understand the directions clearly:

"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

This makes the direction clear. TPP(x,y) means x is a part of y, and TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), so TPPi(x,y) means y is a part of x.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a part of y.

By transitivity, z is a part of x. And since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z)), and y might touch the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), z definitely doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x).

Given the notation, the relationship between x and z would be NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just remembered that TPP and NTPP also specify "proper" part, not just "part". Let me check this again.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. And we've already established that z doesn't touch the boundary of x, so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Hence, the relationship is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer remains: NTPPi(x,z).

I am a bit nervous about having made an error. To double check, let me look at the original definitions of the RCC-8 relations:

"DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x). Finally, EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident."

Alright, so:
- TPP(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), so TPPi(x,y) means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x), so NTPPi(x,y) means y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

By transitivity, z is part of x. And since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z)), and y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I have second thoughts again. Let me make sure I understand the RCC-8 relations correctly:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): Inverse of TPP, which is TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): Inverse of NTPP, which is NTPP(y,x). So NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

What is the relationship between x and z?

Since y is a tangential proper part of x, it's a subset of x. And since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it's a subset of y. By transitivity, z is a subset of x.

But what kind of subset is z of x? Let's analyze:
- z is a proper subset of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- y is a proper subset of x and touches the boundary of x.

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only bridge between z and the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x).

Given the notation in the problem, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I should focus more and get this right. The definitions of the RCC-8 relations are provided as:

- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

I need to find the relationship between x and z. Let's think spatially:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a part of x. Visualize y as a region inside x, with some parts of y touching the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a part of y. Visualize z as a region inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

So, we have z inside y, and y inside x. Clearly, z is inside x (by transitivity). The question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

Given that z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only part that can touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x).

Applying the inverse, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

I'm now confident that the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

But let me just see if there are any other possible relationships. 

First, let's make sure that z is a proper part of x, and not equal to x. We know that z is a proper part of y (from NTPPi(y,z)), and y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)). By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. So the relation can't be EQ(x,z).

Could the relation be NTPP(x,z)? That would mean x is a proper part of z. But we just established that z is a proper part of x, so this contradicts the antisymmetry of the "proper part" relation. So the relation can't be NTPP(x,z).

Could the relation be TPP(x,z)? That would mean x is a proper part of z. But again, we've established that z is a proper part of x, which contradicts the antisymmetry of the "proper part" relation. So the relation can't be TPP(x,z).

Could the relation be TPPi(x,z)? That would mean z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. But we've already determined that z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So the relation can't be TPPi(x,z).

Could the relation be DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)? These would mean x and z are disconnected or externally connected, respectively. But we know z is a part of x, so these relations are not possible.

Could the relation be PO(x,z)? This would mean x and z partially overlap. But we know z is a proper part of x, so this relation is not possible.

So, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, to be thorough, let me remind myself: 
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

The relationship NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is what we've just concluded.

However, I'm again a bit unsure about the direction. So, for my own certainty, let me verify by thinking about a specific visualization. Picture:
- x as a large circle.
- y as a smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at one point.
- z as an even smaller circle inside y, but not touching the boundary of y.

In this setup:
- y is a proper part of x, touching x's boundary. So TPPi(x,y) holds.
- z is a proper part of y, not touching y's boundary. So NTPPi(y,z) holds.
- z is a proper part of x (due to transitivity), not touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) would hold.

This confirms that NTPPi(x,z) is the correct answer. But let me also double-check the definition of NTPPi again. 

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

If NTPP(y,x) means y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,y) also means the same. In our case, NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This aligns with our conclusion.

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

I think my confusion was from the notation. Let me set things up from the beginning.
Let's use the notation where NTPP(r1, r2) means r1 is a non-tangential proper part of r2. In other words, r1 is a proper part of r2 and r1 doesn't touch the boundary of r2.

Given the transitivity of the part-of relation:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, by transitivity, z is a proper part of x. But does z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only possible way for z to touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x). Using the inverse notation, this becomes NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, just to be really sure, let's think one more time about the relationship between z and x.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Geometrically, y is contained within x and touches x's boundary, while z is contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

The possible RCC-8 relationships between z and x are:
1. DC(z,x): z and x are disconnected. This is not possible because z is within y, and y is within x.
2. EC(z,x): z and x are externally connected. This is not possible for the same reason.
3. PO(z,x): z and x partially overlap. This is not possible because z is entirely within x.
4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z touches the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only route for z to reach the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. So, this is not possible.
5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given our reasoning above, this is consistent with our scenario.
6. TPPi(z,x): This is TPP(x,z), which means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because x contains z, not the other way around.
7. NTPPi(z,x): This is NTPP(x,z), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible for the same reason.
8. EQ(z,x): z and x are equal. This is not possible because z is within y, which is a proper part of x, so z is also a proper part of x.

Of all the RCC-8 relationships, only NTPP(z,x) is consistent with our scenario. The answer to "what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is NTPP(z,x).

But the question asks for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. So, using the inverse notation, NTPP(z,x) becomes NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I feel a bit stupid because it seems I had this right earlier but kept second-guessing myself. Let me put it to rest definitively:

1. We're looking for the RCC-8 relationship between x and z, not z and x.
2. From our reasoning, we've established that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x).
3. The relationship between x and z is the inverse of the relationship between z and x. Since the relationship between z and x is NTPP(z,x), the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

The answer is NTPPi(x,z).

To be clear, from the original problem statement:

"If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?"

The question is asking for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. The answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me double check one more time. In the given problem, the 8 possible binary spatial relations of the RCC-8 calculus are:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected.
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Given the setup:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

The relationship between x and z means we're looking for the relation R where R(x,z) holds. 

From our analysis, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

OK for real this time, from the problem statement:

"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So the meaning of TPPi(x,y) is y is a tangential proper part of x, and the meaning of NTPPi(y,z) is z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We've already determined that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x). The relation R(x,z) that holds is the one where z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I don't think I need to mention this, but let me just make sure I'm saying everything correctly:

1. The relation where x is a tangential proper part of y is denoted as TPP(x,y).
2. The relation where y is a tangential proper part of x is denoted as TPPi(x,y).
3. The relation where x is a non-tangential proper part of y is denoted as NTPP(x,y).
4. The relation where y is a non-tangential proper part of x is denoted as NTPPi(x,y).

Given the setup:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

The relation that holds between x and z is:
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

This is the case because z is contained within y, which is contained within x. Also, since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only way z could touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Hence, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, in my answer, I didn't use that fact that TPPi(x,y) means specifically a *tangential* proper part, and not a non-tangential proper part.
So I should check this: is there a scenario where y is a proper part of x in a way that makes z a tangential proper part of x?

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We're looking for a scenario where z is a tangential proper part of x. For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z needs to touch the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z)), and y is the bridge between z and the boundary of x, the only way z could touch the boundary of x is if the boundary of y overlaps with the boundary of x at some point, and z touches that point.

But this contradicts the given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z doesn't touch the boundary of y. Therefore, z cannot be a tangential proper part of x.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to be yet more precise. The relationship between z and the boundary of x is what determines the relationship between z and x. If z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x, denoted as TPP(z,x).

But given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We need to understand the spatial implication. The fact that y is a tangential proper part of x means that y touches the boundary of x at some points. The fact that z is a non-tangential proper part of y means that z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only pathway for z to reach the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, denoted as NTPP(z,x).

Using the inverse notation, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, to summarize:
We know 
- TPPi(x, y): y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z does not touch the boundary of y.

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it does not touch the boundary of y. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, it touches the boundary of x. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only way for z to reach the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, denoted as NTPP(z,x). Expressed in the other direction, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, what if there's a scenario where y doesn't totally enclose z? What if there's a shared boundary between x, y, and z? Let me check if I've missed anything.

For there to be a shared boundary between x, y, and z, z must touch the boundary of y, which in turn touches the boundary of x. However, given NTPPi(y,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z doesn't touch the boundary of y. This contradicts the possibility of a shared boundary. So, I haven't missed anything.

The relationship between x and z remains NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just want to make sure I haven't miscalculated. Let me translate the given relationships into set theory (which is conceptually easier for me to reason about). 

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which implies y ⊂ x and y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅, where ∂x denotes the boundary of x. In simpler terms, y is a proper subset of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which implies z ⊂ y and z ∩ ∂y = ∅. In simpler terms, z is a proper subset of y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these:
- Since z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x, it implies z ⊂ x by transitivity. In simpler terms, z is a subset of x.
- Since z ∩ ∂y = ∅ and y is the only pathway for z to reach ∂x, it implies z ∩ ∂x = ∅. In simpler terms, z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, z ⊂ x and z ∩ ∂x = ∅, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x). The inverse of this, denoted as NTPPi(x,z), is the relationship between x and z.

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, there's a point of confusion I want to make sure I cleared up. In the RCC-8 calculus, the relationship between two regions is denoted as R(a,b), where a and b are the regions in question. The original problem asks for the relationship between x and z, which corresponds to finding the relation R where R(x,z) holds.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), which in turn means y is a tangential proper part of x. In the RCC-8 notation, y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which in turn means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In the RCC-8 notation, z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

We've already determined that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) in the RCC-8 notation. The relationship between x and z, in the RCC-8 notation, would be the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, so:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

The question asks for the possible relationships between x and z. 

From our analysis, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x). In the context of the question, which asks for the relationship between x and z, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

In the RCC-8 calculus, there are eight possible relations between two regions. We've shown that the only possible relation between x and z, given the constraints, is NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the final answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z based on the given relations TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me interpret what these given relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, z is completely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now I'll analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. Since z is contained within y (from NTPPi(y,z)), and y is contained within x (from TPPi(x,y)), by transitivity, z must be contained within x.

2. Can z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (being non-tangential), and y is the only pathway for z to potentially reach x's boundary, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

3. Therefore, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x).

4. The relationship between x and z (as opposed to z and x) would be the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

I've considered all eight possible RCC-8 relations, and NTPPi(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given the constraints.
