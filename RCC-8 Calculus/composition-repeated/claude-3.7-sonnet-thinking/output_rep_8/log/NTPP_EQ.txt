PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1) We have NTPP(x,y), which means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is completely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

2) We also have EQ(y,z), which means that y and z are coincident or equal regions. This means that y and z occupy exactly the same space.

Now, let's determine the possible relationship between x and z.

Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), they occupy the same space. And since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region
- Therefore, x must be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, which is the definition of NTPP(x,z)

So, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given information:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is fully contained within y without touching its boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

To determine the relationship between x and z, I need to understand what happens when we combine these relations.

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical spatial regions, they have the same boundaries and interior. If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (completely contained within y without touching y's boundary), then x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
