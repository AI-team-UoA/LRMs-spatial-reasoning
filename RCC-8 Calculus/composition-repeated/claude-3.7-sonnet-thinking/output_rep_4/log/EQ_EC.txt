PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this systematically. 

We're given that:
1. EQ(x,y) - This means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they have the same spatial extent.
2. EC(y,z) - This means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

We want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), this means that x and y are the same spatial entity. So whatever spatial relationship y has with any other entity, x will have the same relationship with that entity.

Given that EC(y,z), it means y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Since x and y are the same spatial entity (due to EQ(x,y)), it follows that x and z also touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

So, the relationship between x and z is:
EC(x,z)

This is the only possible relationship given the constraints.

Actually, let me double-check this. I need to remember that these relations are pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive.

The eight RCC-8 relations are:
1. DC(x,y) - x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y) - x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y) - x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y) - x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y) - x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y) - same as TPP(y,x), i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y) - same as NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident.

Given that EQ(x,y), x and y are the same spatial entity. And given that EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary.

Therefore, x and z must also touch at a boundary, meaning EC(x,z).

Let's verify this:
- Can x and z be disconnected (DC)? No, because y and z touch, and x is the same as y.
- Can x and z partially overlap (PO)? No, because y and z don't share any interior parts, and x is the same as y.
- Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)? No, because y is not a proper part of z, and x is the same as y.
- Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)? No, for the same reason as above.
- Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)? No, because z is not a proper part of y, and x is the same as y.
- Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)? No, for the same reason as above.
- Can x and z be equal (EQ)? No, because y and z are not equal, and x is the same as y.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Actually, I should've been more careful. Let me rethink my reasoning.

Given:
1. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident, which means they have the same spatial extent.
2. EC(y,z) - y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

To determine the relationship between x and z, I need to consider how the EQ relation affects other relations.

If EQ(x,y), then x and y are the same spatial entity. This means:
- If y is related to z in a certain way, then x will be related to z in the same way.

Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Since x is the same as y (due to EQ(x,y)), x must also touch z at a boundary without sharing any interior parts.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is EC(x,z).

Let's confirm that this is the only possibility:

If EQ(x,y), then any statement about y can be transformed into an equivalent statement about x. So, if EC(y,z), then EC(x,z).

Yes, the relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship can hold between x and z given the information:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (exactly the same spatial region)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same spatial entity, x must have the same relationship with z that y has with z. If y is externally connected to z, then x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
