PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
2. EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, so they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Given that x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and y only touches z at the boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary. This means x and z cannot be externally connected (EC).

Since x is strictly inside y, and y and z don't share interior points (they only touch at boundaries), x and z cannot overlap in their interior. This means x and z cannot be in a partial overlap (PO) relationship.

Since x is strictly inside y, and y and z don't share interior points, x cannot contain z in any way. This means that TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Since x is strictly inside y, and y and z don't share interior points, x cannot be equal to z. This means EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Since x is strictly inside y, and y only touches z at the boundary, x must be completely separated from z by at least the boundary of y. This means x and z are disconnected (DC).

So, based on the given conditions, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Is it possible for x to be a proper part of z (either TPP or NTPP)? Let's think...

If x were a proper part of z, then at least some part of z would be inside y (since x is inside y). But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, they only touch at boundaries. So, x cannot be a proper part of z.

Can x be equal to z? No, because if x were equal to z, then z would be completely inside y (since x is), which contradicts EC(y,z).

Can x partially overlap with z (PO)? No, because if they partially overlapped, then some part of z would be inside y (since x is inside y), which contradicts EC(y,z).

Can x and z be externally connected (EC)? No, because x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z only touches y's boundary. So, x and z are separated by at least the distance from x to y's boundary.

So, after reconsideration, the only possible relationship between x and z is still DC(x,z).

Actually, let's be extra sure by working through each of the 8 relations systematically:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? Yes, as explained above, x is strictly inside y and z is outside y (touching only at the boundary), so x and z are separated by at least the boundary of y.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be externally connected? No, because x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z only touches y at the boundary. So, x and z cannot touch.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? No, because if they did, then some part of z would be inside y (since x is inside y), which contradicts EC(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z? No, because if x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would touch the boundary of z. But x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z only touches y at the boundary. So, x cannot touch the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, because if x were a non-tangential proper part of z, then z would contain x and extend beyond x. Since x is inside y, some part of z would be inside y, which contradicts EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x? No, because if z were a tangential proper part of x, then z would be completely inside x. But EC(y,z) means z touches the boundary of y, which is not possible if z is inside x (since x is strictly inside y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x? No, for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be equal? No, because if they were, then z would be strictly inside y, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, after systematically going through all 8 relations, I confirm that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, actually, let me be careful here. I know that:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

I want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly by considering a specific example. Imagine:
- y is a circle
- x is a smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary
- z is a circle outside y, touching y at just one point on the boundary

In this case, x and z are clearly disconnected. This confirms DC(x,z) as a possible relationship.

But what if z is very large and "wraps around" a significant portion of y's boundary? Could x then be a part of z?

Let's see. Even if z wraps around y's boundary, as long as EC(y,z) holds, z doesn't share any interior points with y. Since x is strictly inside y, x cannot be inside z. So, x cannot be a part of z (neither TPP nor NTPP).

Could z be a part of x? No, because EC(y,z) means z touches y's boundary, which is outside x. So, z cannot be completely inside x.

Could x and z partially overlap? No, because if they did, then some part of z would be inside y (since x is inside y), which contradicts EC(y,z).

Could x and z be externally connected? No, because x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z only touches y at the boundary. So, x and z are separated by at least the distance from x to y's boundary.

So, after revisiting this, I believe the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

Let me be completely precise.

If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then we can deduce:
1. x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
2. y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Let's check each of the 8 possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. Since x is strictly inside y, and z only touches y at the boundary without sharing interior points, x and z don't share any points. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary, while z only touches y at the boundary. So, x and z can't touch. EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some points but neither is a part of the other. But x is strictly inside y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y. So, x and z can't overlap. PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, so x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But x is strictly inside y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y. So, x can't be inside z. TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so x is strictly inside z. But x is strictly inside y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y. So, x can't be inside z. NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But z touches y's boundary, and x is strictly inside y. So, z can't be inside x. TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is strictly inside x. But z touches y's boundary, and x is strictly inside y. So, z can't be inside x. NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. But x is strictly inside y, and z touches y's boundary. So, x and z can't be the same. EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

After checking all 8 relations, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

OK wait. I'm not being as creative as I should be. Let me think more carefully about this problem.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

I've already established that x and z cannot have any of these relationships: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ. But I need to more carefully consider the DC and EC relationships.

Let me think about different ways that y and z can externally connect.

Scenario 1: Imagine y is a circle, and z is another circle outside y, touching y at just one point. In this case, x (which is inside y) is clearly disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Scenario 2: Imagine y is a donut (a circle with a hole in the middle), and z is a small circle inside the hole of the donut, touching the inner boundary of y. Since x is inside y (the donut) and not touching its boundary, x is disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is still the relationship.

Scenario 3: Imagine y is a C-shaped region, and z is a small circle that fits inside the opening of the C, touching y at the two endpoints of the C. In this case, x (which is inside the C) might still be disconnected from z.

Wait, let's think about Scenario 3 more carefully. If y is C-shaped, then "inside" y refers to the interior of the C, not the space inside the opening of the C. So, if x is truly inside y (in the interior of the C), then x is still disconnected from z.

Actually, I don't think I can come up with a scenario where x and z can be anything other than disconnected, given the constraints.

So, the answer is: DC(x,z).

Actually, I just realized I could miss some cases if I just rely on a few concrete examples. Let me reason systematically.

We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. Is this possible? Yes, consider Scenario 1 above, where y is a circle, z is outside y, and x is inside y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Is this possible? For this to be true, x would need to touch z's boundary. But since x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z can't touch. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some points but neither is a part of the other. For this to be true, x and z would need to share some interior points. But since x is strictly inside y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y (due to EC(y,z)), x and z can't share any interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, so x is inside z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, x would need to be inside z. But since x is strictly inside y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y (due to EC(y,z)), x can't be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so x is strictly inside z. For this to be true, x would need to be inside z. But since x is strictly inside y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y (due to EC(y,z)), x can't be inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches x's boundary. For this to be true, z would need to be inside x. But since z touches y's boundary (due to EC(y,z)), and x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), z can't be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is strictly inside x. For this to be true, z would need to be inside x. But since z touches y's boundary (due to EC(y,z)), and x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), z can't be inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. For this to be true, x and z would need to be identical. But since x is strictly inside y, and z touches y's boundary (due to EC(y,z)), x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After going through all 8 relations, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

But wait, let me just think a bit more conceptually. In 2D or 3D space, since x is strictly inside y, and y and z only touch at their boundaries, x and z must be disconnected. It's like saying, "If a point is inside a closed shape, and another shape touches the first shape only at its boundary, then the point and the second shape must be disconnected."

However, I want to be absolutely sure and consider any potential edge cases. Let's think about the problem using a different approach.

Let's define the interior of y as int(y), the boundary of y as bd(y), and the exterior of y as ext(y).

Given NTPP(x,y), we know that x is completely inside int(y).
Given EC(y,z), we know that z intersects with bd(y) but not with int(y).

Now, let's check each of the 8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must not share any points. Since x is inside int(y) and z does not intersect with int(y), they don't share any points. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. But since x is inside int(y) and z does not intersect with int(y), they can't touch. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must share some interior points. But since x is inside int(y) and z does not intersect with int(y), they can't share interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be inside z and touch z's boundary. But since x is inside int(y) and z does not intersect with int(y), x can't be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be strictly inside z. But since x is inside int(y) and z does not intersect with int(y), x can't be inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be inside x and touch x's boundary. But since z intersects with bd(y) and x is inside int(y), z can't be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be strictly inside x. But since z intersects with bd(y) and x is inside int(y), z can't be inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must be the same region. But since x is inside int(y) and z intersects with bd(y), they can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After this analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is still DC(x,z).

To be absolutely certain, let me think of one more perspective.

Let's think about the region of space. Given NTPP(x,y), x is a proper subset of int(y).
Given EC(y,z), z intersects with bd(y) but not with int(y).

Since x is a subset of int(y) and z doesn't intersect with int(y), x and z don't share any points. Hence, DC(x,z) is the only possible relation.

I'm confident that the answer is DC(x,z).

Oops, let me make one more consideration. I implicitly assumed that we're dealing with regions in standard Euclidean space, which is what RCC-8 is typically used for. 

If we're considering more abstract spaces or some non-standard interpretation, there could be other possibilities. But based on the standard RCC-8 calculus interpretation, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I've been working in 2D, but RCC-8 can also apply to higher dimensional spaces. So, let me just double-check that my reasoning holds in 3D or higher dimensions.

In any dimension, if x is strictly inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), then x and z must be disconnected (DC(x,z)) for the same reasons I've outlined. The dimensionality doesn't change the nature of the relationships.

So, after careful consideration, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, one more thing to double-check: maybe NTPP(x,y) means that x is a subset of int(y), but it might not be a proper subset. Let me check if NTPP means non-tangential proper part, meaning that x is a proper subset of int(y) (not equal to the whole of int(y)) and also x doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Looking back at the definition of NTPP(x,y): "x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary." 

This confirms what I've been thinking. NTPP(x,y) means x is a subset of int(y) (because it doesn't touch the boundary of y), and it's a proper subset of y (because it's a proper part).

So, my reasoning is correct. The relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I don't believe I've been entirely precise in how I've been writing. Let me be very clear.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper subset of the interior of y, not touching y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

I want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Here's what I know:
- Since x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, x is contained within the interior of y.
- Since y and z touch only at their boundaries, z does not intersect with the interior of y.

Since x is within the interior of y and z doesn't intersect with the interior of y, x and z don't share any points. This means x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).

So, the answer is: DC(x,z).

Actually, I have one last consideration.

Are there any cases where EC(y,z) could mean y and z touch, but z might penetrate into y?

No, EC(y,z) specifically means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. If z penetrated into y, they would share interior points, which would make them PO (partially overlapping) or in another relationship, not EC.

So, my reasoning is correct. The relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, one more thing. I described EC(y,z) as "y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points," which is exactly what it means in RCC-8. It's good to restate the exact definition: EC(y,z) means that y and z have no interior points in common, but they do have a boundary point in common.

Similarly, NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but doesn't share any boundary with y; that is, x is in the interior of y.

Given these precise definitions, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

So, after thorough analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me be absolutely clear.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper subset of y, and x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

I want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's consider a point p. If p is in x, then p is in the interior of y (since x is in the interior of y). If p is in z, then p is not in the interior of y (since z and y don't share interior points). Hence, no point can be in both x and z.

Since x and z don't share any points, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).

So, the answer is: DC(x,z).

Hmm, but let me consider a weird scenario. Imagine that y is a "horseshoe" or "C" shape, and z is a region that touches the boundary of y at the two "open ends" of the C. Could x, which is inside y, potentially touch z?

No, because "inside" in NTPP(x,y) refers to the interior of y, not the space inside the opening of the C. So, x is within the material of the C, not in the empty space inside the C. And since z only touches the boundary of y, x and z are still disconnected.

Alright, I've verified from multiple angles, and the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I've been a bit confusing with my wording. Let me clarify with more precision.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, not touching the boundary of y.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

The interior of a region is its point set minus its boundary. So, NTPP(x,y) means that x is a subset of the interior of y. And EC(y,z) means that z doesn't intersect with the interior of y, only with its boundary.

Since x is inside the interior of y, and z doesn't intersect with the interior of y, x and z don't share any points. This means x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).

So, the answer is: DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relations tell us:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Given these constraints, let me check each possible relation between x and z:

1. Since x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z only touches y at y's boundary without sharing interior points with y, there's no way for x and z to share any points.

2. x cannot be externally connected to z because x doesn't reach y's boundary, while z only touches y at the boundary.

3. x cannot overlap with z because z doesn't penetrate into y's interior.

4. x cannot be a part of z (TPP or NTPP) because z doesn't intersect y's interior.

5. z cannot be a part of x (TPPi or NTPPi) because z touches y's boundary which x cannot reach.

6. x and z cannot be equal because x is inside y while z is outside y (except at boundary points).

Therefore, the only possible relation is that x and z are disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
