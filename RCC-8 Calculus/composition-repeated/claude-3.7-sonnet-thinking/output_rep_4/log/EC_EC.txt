PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm being asked to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts

Let me think about what the possible relations could be between x and z, given these constraints:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts
   This is possible. If x touches y at one boundary point, and z touches y at a different boundary point, then x and z could be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
   This is possible. If x and z both touch y at nearby points, they might also touch each other.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is possible. Even though x and y only touch at boundaries, and y and z only touch at boundaries, x and z could overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x could touch the boundary of y at one point, while z could be much larger, contain x, and touch y at some other point.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is not possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z. But since x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, that means x must at least be tangential to z.

Actually, let me reconsider this. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, then it is possible for x to not touch the boundary of z if z completely contains y except for where y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. z could touch the boundary of y at one point, while x could be much larger, contain z, and touch y at some other point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is possible by the same logic as NTPP(x,z) but with x and z switched.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident
   This is possible. If x and z are the same region, and both touch y at the same boundary point, then they would be equivalent.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. If x and z are the same region (EQ(x,z)), and EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then x = z, so we have EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). But this seems contradictory, because if x and y touch at a boundary, and y and x touch at a boundary, this implies a symmetric relationship. The RCC-8 relations are supposed to be mutually exclusive, so we can't have both EC(x,y) and EC(y,x) unless EC is symmetric, which it is.

So EQ(x,z) is possible, but only if EC(x,y) and EC(z,y) are referring to the same boundary point. If EC is defined so that it doesn't matter where on the boundary the touching occurs, then EQ(x,z) is possible.

On second thought, I think EQ(x,z) is possible. If x = z, then EC(x,y) and EC(z,y) are the same statement.

Let's take a step back and think about this more carefully. I need to determine which of the 8 RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

DC(x,z): If x and y touch at a boundary point p1, and y and z touch at a different boundary point p2, then x and z could be completely separate. So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): If x and z both touch y at nearby boundary points, or if they meet at a common boundary point where they both touch y, then x and z could touch at a boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other. Given that x and y only touch at boundaries, and y and z only touch at boundaries, can x and z overlap? Yes, they can. Imagine x and z as two large regions that both touch y at different boundary points, but they also overlap with each other in a region that doesn't include y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. That is, x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. Is this possible? Yes. Imagine z as a large region, and x as a small region completely inside z but touching z's boundary. Both x and z can touch y at different boundary points. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, x is completely contained in z and does not touch the boundary of z. Is this possible? It's not immediately obvious, but I think it is possible. Imagine z as a large region, and x as a small region completely inside z and not touching z's boundary. Both x and z can touch y at different boundary points, as long as the point where x touches y is not on z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) is not possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely surrounded by the interior of z. But if x touches the boundary of y, and y is external to z (since y and z only touch at a boundary), then x must also touch the boundary of z. This contradicts the definition of NTPP.

Let me reconsider NTPP(x,z) again. If EC(x,y), then x touches the boundary of y. If EC(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the point where x touches y is also a point on the boundary of z. So I think NTPP(x,z) is still possible. Imagine z as a large region, y as external to z and touching z at a boundary point, and x as a small region inside z but not touching z's boundary, yet still touching y's boundary.

Actually, I think I was right the first time, and NTPP(x,z) is not possible. If EC(x,y), then x touches the boundary of y. If EC(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely in the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But since y is outside of z (as EC(y,z) means they only touch at a boundary), and x touches y, x must also touch the boundary of z. This contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me try to resolve this by considering specific shapes. Imagine z as a circle, and y as another circle that touches z at a single point. Now, for x to satisfy EC(x,y), x must touch the boundary of y. But if x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z (as required for NTPP(x,z)), then x can't reach the boundary of y without crossing the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Following the same logic as for TPP(x,z), with x and z swapped, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Following the same logic as for NTPP(x,z), with x and z swapped, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If x = z, then EC(x,y) and EC(z,y) are the same statement, which is consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region

Wait, I'm still not convinced about NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me think again:

For NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely in the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x touches the boundary of y. If EC(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. Can x touch the boundary of y without touching the boundary of z?

I think it depends on how exactly y and z touch. If y and z touch at a single point, and x also touches y at that same point, then x would also touch z at that point, which would make it TPP(x,z), not NTPP(x,z). But if y and z touch at a different point than where x touches y, then x could be completely in the interior of z and still touch the boundary of y. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I don't think that's right. If y is outside of z (since EC(y,z) means they only touch at a boundary), and x touches y, then x must at least touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try a different approach. The RCC-8 composition table would give the correct answer for this, but I don't have it memorized. Instead, let's use the properties of the relations:

- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely in the interior of z and not touch z's boundary. But if x is in the interior of z, and y is outside of z (since EC(y,z) means they only touch at a boundary), then how can x touch the boundary of y? It would have to cross the boundary of z, which would mean x touches the boundary of z, contradicting NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

By the same logic, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region

Actually, I'm still not convinced about NTPP and NTPPi. Let's try to be more precise:

NTPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. Given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), we know that x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z.

Let's consider the point p where y touches z. Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at p but do not share interior parts. Since EC(x,y), x touches the boundary of y, but not necessarily at p. In fact, x could touch y at a different point q on y's boundary.

So, we have x touching y at point q, and y touching z at point p. Now, can x be completely contained in the interior of z, without touching z's boundary? If q is also on the boundary of z, then x would touch the boundary of z, contradicting NTPP(x,z). But if q is not on the boundary of z, then it's possible for x to be completely in the interior of z and still touch the boundary of y at point q.

Wait, but is this scenario actually possible? If q is not on the boundary of z, then it's in the interior of z or the exterior of z. If it's in the interior of z, then y would also have to be in the interior of z at point q, which contradicts EC(y,z). If q is in the exterior of z, then x would have to be in the exterior of z at point q, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible. By the same logic, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible either.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region

Actually, let me just verify once more that NTPP(x,z) is not possible, as I'm still having some doubts.

NTPP(x,z) means x is completely contained in the interior of z, without touching the boundary of z. Given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), we know that x touches the boundary of y at some point p, and y touches the boundary of z at some point q.

Now, if x is completely in the interior of z, can it touch the boundary of y? Let's consider where the boundary of y is in relation to z:
- Some parts of y's boundary might be in the exterior of z.
- Some parts of y's boundary might be on the boundary of z (specifically, the point q).
- Some parts of y's boundary might be in the interior of z.

For x to touch the boundary of y while being completely in the interior of z, x would have to touch a part of y's boundary that is also in the interior of z. But given that EC(y,z), the only part of y that touches z is at the boundary point q. The rest of y is in the exterior of z.

So, there's no part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z for x to touch. Therefore, if x touches the boundary of y, it must be at a point that is either on the boundary of z or in the exterior of z. But both of these contradict NTPP(x,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

By the same logic, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible either.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region

Actually, I'm still not convinced about NTPP(x,z). Let me try once more with a specific example:

Imagine z as a circle in the plane. Now, imagine y as a smaller circle that touches z at a single point on the boundary. Now, imagine x as an even smaller circle inside z that doesn't touch the boundary of z, but does touch the boundary of y. This seems to satisfy EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But wait, there's an issue with this example. If y is outside of z except for the single point where they touch, and x is inside z, how can x touch y? It would have to cross the boundary of z, which contradicts the assumption that x is completely in the interior of z.

So, it seems like NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible. And by the same logic, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible either.

So, to summarize, the possible relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region

Now let me just triple check my answer by thinking about the EQ(x,z) case, which means x and z are the same region. If x = z, then EC(x,y) and EC(z,y) are the same statement, which is consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Next, TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. That is, x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. Given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), we know that x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z. It's possible for x to be completely inside z, touch the boundary of z at a point, and also touch the boundary of y at a point. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. By the same logic as above, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z) means x and z share some interior parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. Given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), it's possible for x and z to partially overlap while both touching the boundary of y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), it's possible for x and z to touch at a boundary while both also touching the boundary of y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected and share no parts. Given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), it's possible for x and z to be completely separate while both touching the boundary of y at different points. So DC(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region

Let me double-check each of these once more to make sure I'm confident in my answer:

DC(x,z): If x touches y at one point and z touches y at a different point, x and z can be completely separate. So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): If x and z both touch y at the same point or at nearby points, they can touch at a boundary without overlapping. So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): If x and z both touch y at the boundary and also overlap with each other, but neither is completely contained in the other, then they partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): If x is completely contained in z, touches the boundary of z, and also touches the boundary of y, then x is a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z): If z is completely contained in x, touches the boundary of x, and also touches the boundary of y, then z is a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, and they both touch y at the boundary, then they are equal. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): If x is completely contained in the interior of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, can it still touch the boundary of y? No, because if y is outside of z (since EC(y,z) means they only touch at a boundary), and x touches y, then x must also touch the boundary of z. This contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): By the same logic as above, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to find all possible RCC-8 spatial relations that can exist between x and z given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

When x externally connects to y, and y externally connects to z, the following relations between x and z are possible:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: x and z can be completely separate while both touching y at different boundary points.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: x and z can touch each other at their boundaries while both also touching y.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: x and z can share some interior parts while both touching y at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: x can be completely inside z but touching z's boundary, while both touch y.

5. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse Tangential Proper Part: z can be completely inside x but touching x's boundary, while both touch y.

6. EQ(x,z) - Equal: x and z can be the same region, which touches y at the boundary.

NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible because if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (or vice versa), it could not simultaneously touch the boundary of y when y only touches z at its boundary.
