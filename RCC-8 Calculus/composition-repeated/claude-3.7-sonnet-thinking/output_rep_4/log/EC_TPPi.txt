PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

First, let's understand what each of the given relations means:

1. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
2. TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now we want to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z.

To do this, I need to think about how the spatial arrangement of x, y, and z looks given the constraints EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Since EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries.
Since TPPi(y,z), z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

There are a few possibilities for how z could be situated relative to x:

1. If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches x, then x and z would be externally connected (EC).
2. If z is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y where y touches x, then x and z would be disconnected (DC).
3. If z overlaps with the area where x and y touch, then there could be a more complex relationship.

Let's think about this more carefully:

Since EC(x,y), x and y only share boundary points, not interior points.
Since TPPi(y,z), z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

If z touches y's boundary at a point where y and x touch, then z and x would touch at a boundary point, making them EC (externally connected).

If z touches y's boundary at a point that doesn't coincide with where x and y touch, then z and x would not share any points, making them DC (disconnected).

I'm not sure if z can partially overlap with x, given that x and y are only externally connected. Let me think about this more...

Since EC(x,y), x and y only share boundary points, not interior points.
Since TPPi(y,z), z is inside y and might touch y's boundary.

Actually, since z is inside y and y only touches x at the boundary, z cannot overlap with x's interior. So, z and x cannot be in a PO (partially overlapping) relationship.

Similarly, z cannot be a tangential proper part of x (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP) since z is inside y and y only touches x at the boundary.

Also, x cannot be a tangential proper part of z (TPPi) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPPi) for the same reason.

And certainly, x and z cannot be equal (EQ).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC (disconnected): If z touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch x.
2. EC (externally connected): If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x.

But wait, let me double-check the EC case. If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x, then z, y, and x would all share that boundary point. This is still consistent with EC(x,z) because they would only share a boundary point, not interior points.

Actually, let's even go through all the 8 relations to double-check:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if z touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch x.
2. EC(x,z): Possible if z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x.
3. PO(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y and y only touches x at the boundary, so z can't overlap with x's interior.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as PO.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as PO.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y and y only touches x at the boundary, so x can't be inside z.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y and y only touches x at the boundary, so x can't be equal to z.

So, it seems the only possible relations between x and z are DC and EC.

But I just realized that there's another possibility I didn't consider. If TPPi(y,z), then z contains y except for their shared boundary. So, z extends beyond y. And if EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. Depending on how z extends beyond y, z could potentially overlap with x, making x and z partially overlapping (PO).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go back to the definitions.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now I'm second-guessing myself. Let me just make sure I understand TPPi correctly...

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). TPP means "tangential proper part". So, TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y, implying z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

But TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z). The inverse of "y is a tangential proper part of z" would be "z is a tangential proper part container of y" or more simply, "y is a tangential proper part of z". So, TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

Ok so TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Given:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

So, we have y inside z, and x touching y at the boundary. Now, we need to determine how x and z relate.

Given that y is inside z and touches z's boundary, there are several ways x could relate to z:

1. If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x might also touch z at the boundary, making x and z externally connected (EC).
2. If x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x would be inside z (because y is inside z), but x would touch z's boundary indirectly through y. This would make x a tangential proper part of z (TPP).
3. If x partially overlaps with z beyond just the boundary (which is possible since z extends beyond y), then x and z would be partially overlapping (PO).
4. It's also possible that x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, making x a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).
5. If x is completely outside of z, then x and z would be disconnected (DC).
6. If x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points, then they would be externally connected (EC).

Hmm, the TPP and NTPP cases here don't sound right. Let's reason a bit more carefully. We have the constraint that EC(x,y), i.e., x and y share a boundary point.

Actually, if x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z (with y also touching z's boundary), then the boundary point where x and y touch could still be completely inside z. In this case, x would intersect with z at a boundary point of y, but this boundary point is in the interior of z. This means x would be partially inside z, making x and z partially overlapping (PO).

But it's also possible that x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x, y, and z would all share a boundary point, making x and z externally connected (EC).

If x is very large and extends well beyond the region where it touches y, then it's possible for x to be disconnected from z (DC) or to partially overlap with z (PO).

If we only care about specific scenarios where we know exactly the shapes and positions of x, y, and z, we could make more definitive statements. But if we're considering all the possible configurations where EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are true, then the possible relations between x and z seem to be DC, EC, and PO.

Actually, let me re-think this using a concrete example. Imagine y as a smaller circle contained inside a bigger circle z, with y touching the boundary of z at one point. Now, imagine x as another circle that's outside y but touches y at one point. Where can this touching point be?

If x touches y at the point where y touches z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary, making EC(x,z).

If x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is partially inside z (since the touching point is inside z) and partially outside (since x isn't entirely within y, which is inside z). This makes x and z partially overlapping (PO).

If x is very large and extends well beyond the region where it touches y, then it's still PO(x,z) because x and z would share an interior point (where x touches y).

Ok, so I think I was right about DC, EC, and PO as possibilities, but I need to check if other relations, like TPP, can also hold.

Given: 
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully inside z, sharing no exterior points, and touches z's boundary.

Let's examine TPP(x,z) as a possibility. This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x is fully inside z and EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. Now, y is also inside z (due to TPPi(y,z)). Since y touches z's boundary and x touches y's boundary, can we still maintain the condition that x is fully inside z? Yes, if x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z.

But there's a problem: if x is fully inside z and EC(x,y), and y is also fully inside z (due to TPPi(y,z)), then the boundary point where x and y touch is in the interior of z. This means x doesn't touch z's boundary, which contradicts the definition of TPP(x,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I realize that I was confusing myself. If y is a tangential proper part of z, y is indeed inside z and touches z's boundary. If x is externally connected to y, then x touches y at the boundary. Depending on where this boundary touch occurs, different relations between x and z are possible.

Actually, let's go back to the definition of TPPi(y,z). It means that y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. Also EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries.

So the way to visualize this is that y is inside z, and x is outside y, and they touch at the boundary. There are generally two cases:

1. x and y touch at a point that's on the boundary of z as well. In this case, x is outside z, but touches z's boundary at the same point it touches y. This means EC(x,z).

2. x and y touch at a point that's inside z (not on z's boundary). In this case, x partially extends into z. So, x and z partially overlap, making PO(x,z).

But there's also a third possibility. What if x is completely inside z, but still only touches y at the boundary? This seems possible to me. In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z, making TPP(x,z).

Let me review all the possibilities again:

1. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary.

2. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x touches y at a point inside z (not on z's boundary) and extends outside z.

3. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, which happens if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, but x is still completely inside z.

4. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This seems unlikely, given our constraints. If x touches y, and y is inside z, then x must at least touch or partially overlap with z. But I could see a counter-intuitive case: x touches y at a point inside z, so the boundary touch happens inside z, making it a point of z's interior. So in this case, x and z still share a common point (in z's interior), and that wouldn't be consistent with DC. So DC might not be possible.

Actually, hold on - I'm making an error in my reasoning. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries. If y is inside z (due to TPPi(y,z)), then the boundary of y is partly inside z (the interior of z) and partly on the boundary of z. 

Actually let's be even more precise: If TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is completely inside z, and y touches the boundary of z.

So, the boundary of y has some points that are inside z and some points that are on the boundary of z.

Now, if EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. This touch can happen at any point on the boundary of y. If the touch happens at a point inside z, then x would extend inside z, making x and z partially overlapping (PO). If the touch happens at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x could also touch z's boundary, making x and z externally connected (EC).

But what if x is completely inside z and only touches y at the boundary? Is this possible? Let's think...

If x is completely inside z, and x touches y at the boundary, then x would be a tangential proper part of z only if it touches z's boundary. This can happen if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary.

Actually, I think my earlier reasoning was incorrect. TPP(x,z) is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This would require x to touch y at a point where y touches z's boundary. But would EC(x,y) still hold in this case? Actually this case shouldn't be valid, as x touches y's "exterior boundary". I'm struggling a bit here.

Let me re-read the definitions one more time to be clear about this. In a 2D setting, I'm trying to visualize the following:

- Region y is a circle inside a larger circle z, touching the boundary of z at one point.
- Region x is a circle that touches y at a point on its boundary.

To decide whether DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), etc., are possible, I need to consider where x can be placed relative to y and z.

If x touches y at a point inside z (not on z's boundary), then x must partially extend into z. In this case, x and z would be partially overlapping (PO).

If x touches y at the point where y touches z's boundary, then x can be placed either:
1. Entirely outside of z, with the only common point being the boundary touch, making EC(x,z).
2. Partially inside z, making PO(x,z).
3. Entirely inside z, in which case x would touch the boundary of z, making TPP(x,z).

Since the problem doesn't specify the size or shape of x, all these configurations are possible. This makes me reconsider whether DC(x,z) could indeed be possible. I initially ruled it out because if x touches y, and y is inside z, then x and z must have a common point (where x touches y). But if this common point is on the boundary of z, x and z could still be disconnected as long as we don't count the boundary touch. But that's the definition of EC, not DC.

Given that DC means x and z share no spatial parts, and if x touches y at a point that's inside or on the boundary of z, then x and z will always share a point. So, DC(x,z) should not be possible.

But I might be overthinking this. So, if EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z seem to be EC, PO, and TPP.

Actually I think there's a logical issue that I'm not picking up. Let's revisit this more systematically, by going through the cases again. We have:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's consider the point p where x and y touch (since EC(x,y)).

Case 1: p is on the boundary of z (which is possible since y touches z's boundary due to TPPi(y,z)).
In this case, x touches z at p. If x is:
   a. Entirely outside z, then EC(x,z).
   b. Partially inside z, then PO(x,z).
   c. Entirely inside z, then TPP(x,z).

Case 2: p is in the interior of z (since y is mostly inside z due to TPPi(y,z)).
In this case, x penetrates into the interior of z. If x is:
   a. Partially inside and outside z, then PO(x,z).
   b. Entirely inside z, but touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).
   c. Entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

Given our constraints, I think the possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But wait, there's a logical issue with TPP and NTPP that I need to address.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. If x touches y at a point in the interior of z, how can x also touch z's boundary without extending outside z? This is possible if x touches y at a point in the interior of z and also extends to touch z's boundary elsewhere.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. If x touches y at a point in the interior of z, and x doesn't extend to touch z's boundary elsewhere, then NTPP(x,z) would be true.

So, the possible relationships do indeed seem to be EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But let's just think about whether NTPP(x,z) is really possible. If NTPP(x,z), then x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Also, EC(x,y) means x touches y at the boundary. Since y is inside z (due to TPPi(y,z)), and x touches y at the boundary but is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, this is a valid configuration. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, let's visualize a simple case to make this clearer. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as an even smaller circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary. The point where x and y touch can be anywhere on y's boundary. If this point is in the interior of z (not on z's boundary), and x is small enough to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would be true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But do we need to consider TPPi, NTPPi, EQ as well? Let's check.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is inside z (due to TPPi(y,z)), and x touches y at the boundary (due to EC(x,y)). If z is inside x, then y is also inside x. But if y is inside x, then x and y can't be externally connected. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also inconsistent with our given constraints for the same reason as TPPi.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region. Again, if x and z are the same, then y is inside x (since y is inside z). But if y is inside x, then x and y can't be externally connected. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Alright, let's summarize our findings.

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z): If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, and x is entirely outside z.
2. PO(x,z): If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, and x is partially inside z. OR If x touches y at a point in the interior of z, and x is partially inside and outside z.
3. TPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, and x is entirely inside z. OR If x touches y at a point in the interior of z, and x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary elsewhere.
4. NTPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point in the interior of z, and x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

These seem to be the only possible relationships between x and z given our constraints.

So, the answer is: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, hold on. I need to revisit one case. I said TPP(x,z) is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, and x is entirely inside z. But if x is entirely inside z, and both x and y touch z's boundary at the same point, doesn't that mean x and y are touching at a point outside of z? That would contradict the constraint that y is inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is only possible if x touches y at a point in the interior of z, and x also extends to touch z's boundary elsewhere.

Hmm, actually I think I was right the first time. If x, y, and z all touch at the same boundary point, and x is entirely inside z, then TPP(x,z) would be true. It's possible for x, y, and z to all share a common boundary point, with y being inside z (TPPi(y,z)), x being inside z (TPP(x,z)), and x and y being externally connected (EC(x,y)).

And let me double-check if DC(x,z) is possible. For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z should have no spatial parts. But if EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z. This means x and z must share at least one point (where x touches y), making DC(x,z) impossible.

Alright, I think the answer is that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But wait, I said TPP(x,z) is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, and x is entirely inside z. Upon reflection, I don't think this is a valid configuration. If x is entirely inside z, then x can't also be touching the boundary of z at the same point where y touches the boundary of z. Because if y is inside z, then y can only touch the boundary of z from the inside. And if x is also inside z, x can only touch the boundary of z from the inside. But if x and y are externally connected (EC(x,y)), they must touch from the outside. So there's a contradiction. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible in the configuration I described. I'm actually not sure that TPP(x,z) is possible at all. I need to think about it again.

Let's reconsider our constraints.
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary.

If x touches y at a point in the interior of z (not on z's boundary), can x also extend to touch z's boundary elsewhere? Yes, this is possible. In this case, x would be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) true.

But the problem I was overlooking is the possibility that x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x also extends to touch z's boundary elsewhere. This would still make EC(x,y) and TPP(x,z) simultaneously possible.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible. And by similar reasoning, NTPP(x,z) is possible if x touches y at a point in the interior of z, and x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Actually, now I'm wondering whether "external connection" means that the two spatial regions only share boundary points. If "externally connected" means they share no interior points, but potentially share boundary points, then the above reasoning is valid. Actually, just checking above from the question definition: "EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts." So our reasoning is sound.

Alright, let's finalize our answer. Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me check that we can create each of these:

For EC(x,z): Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as a circle outside z that touches y at the point where y touches z's boundary. Here, x and z touch at their boundaries, making EC(x,z) true.

For PO(x,z): Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as a circle that partially extends into z. If x touches y at a point inside z, then x and z would be partially overlapping, making PO(x,z) true.

For TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as an even smaller circle entirely inside z. If x touches y at a point inside z (not on z's boundary), and x also extends to touch z's boundary elsewhere, then x would be a tangential proper part of z, making TPP(x,z) true.

For NTPP(x,z): Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as an even smaller circle entirely inside z. If x touches y at a point inside z (not on z's boundary), and x doesn't touch z's boundary anywhere, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, making NTPP(x,z) true.

All these configurations are valid, and thus, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP are the possible relationships between x and z given our constraints.

Actually, let me stop and reconsider the original constraints one last time to triple-check:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these constraints, I've identified the possible relationships between x and z as: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, in my examples above, I'm not sure that I've effectively constructed a TPP(x,z) that's consistent with EC(x,y). Let me try that again.

Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as an even smaller circle entirely inside z.

If x touches y at a point inside z (not on z's boundary), and x also extends to touch z's boundary elsewhere, then TPP(x,z) would be true. But would EC(x,y) still hold? For EC(x,y) to be true, x and y must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. If x touches y at a point inside z, then x and y would be touching at their boundaries. As long as they don't overlap, EC(x,y) would be true.

Actually, I think some of my confusion stemmed from not clearly understanding the 'touch' relation. In the RCC-8 calculus, 'touch' means sharing a boundary point but not sharing interior points. So, if x and y touch, they share a boundary point but don't overlap.

With this understanding, let's visualize the TPP(x,z) case again. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as an even smaller circle entirely inside z. x touches y at a point inside z (not on z's boundary), and x also extends to touch z's boundary elsewhere. In this configuration, x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) true. And since x and y touch only at their boundaries, EC(x,y) is also true.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship. And by similar reasoning, so is NTPP(x,z).

In summary, given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the possible configurations given that EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

From the definitions:
- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Given these constraints, let me determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at the exact point where y touches z's boundary. In this scenario, x and z would share just that boundary point.

2. PO(x,z): This is possible if x extends partially inside z. This happens when x touches y at a point inside z and x also extends outside of z.

3. TPP(x,z): This can occur if x touches y at a point in z's interior, and x is completely inside z while also touching z's boundary at some other point.

4. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at a point in z's interior, and x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

The relations DC, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible between x and z under these constraints.
