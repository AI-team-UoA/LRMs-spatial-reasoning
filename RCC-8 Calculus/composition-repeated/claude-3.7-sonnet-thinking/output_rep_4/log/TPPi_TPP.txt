PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's step through this problem carefully.

I'm given that TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). I need to find all possible relationships between x and z.

First, let me understand what TPPi(x,y) means:
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)
- TPP(y,x) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.

So TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.

Second, I understand that TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is a proper part of z and y touches z's boundary.

Now I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z. Let's think about this spatially:

- x contains y (since TPPi(x,y))
- y is contained in z (since TPP(y,z))

So x contains something (y) that is contained in z. But this doesn't fully determine the relationship between x and z. Let's think about the possible scenarios:

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC) - This is not possible because x contains y, and y is part of z, so x and z must share at least the part y.

2. x and z could be externally connected (EC) - This is not possible for the same reason as above. Since they share a part y, they cannot just be externally connected.

3. x and z could partially overlap (PO) - This is possible. x contains y, and y is contained in z, but x could have parts outside of z, and z could have parts outside of x.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP) - This is possible. If x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP) - This is possible. If x is fully contained within z but does not touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi) - This is possible. If z is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi) - This is not obviously possible. If z contains y, and y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), then it seems like z should also touch x's boundary, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible. But let me double-check this reasoning...

Actually, I think NTPPi(x,z) is possible. Consider the case where z is entirely contained within x, but doesn't touch x's boundary. However, y is part of z and touches x's boundary. This scenario is consistent with our given constraints.

8. x and z could be equal (EQ) - This is possible. If x and z are the same region, then both could contain y as a tangential proper part.

Let me try to narrow this down further by thinking about specific examples:

- TPPi(x,y) means that y is tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is tangential proper part of z.

For PO(x,z), I would have x and z partially overlapping, with y in the overlap.
For TPP(x,z), I would have x entirely within z, touching z's boundary, with y inside x.
For NTPP(x,z), I would have x entirely within z, not touching z's boundary, with y inside x.
For TPPi(x,z), I would have z entirely within x, touching x's boundary, with y inside z.
For NTPPi(x,z), I would have z entirely within x, not touching x's boundary, with y inside z.
For EQ(x,z), I would have x and z being the same region, with y inside both.

Let me reconsider if all of these are consistent with our constraints:

For PO(x,z):
- y is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
- y is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
- x and z partially overlap, with y in the overlap.
This seems consistent. y can be in the overlap region, touching both x's and z's boundaries.

For TPP(x,z):
- y is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
- y is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
- x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
This seems consistent. x can be entirely within z, touching z's boundary, and y can be within x, touching x's boundary (and possibly also z's boundary).

For NTPP(x,z):
- y is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
- y is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
- x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.
Is this consistent? If x doesn't touch z's boundary, can y (which is inside x) touch z's boundary? Actually, yes, it can. y can touch x's boundary from the inside, and x can be fully inside z without touching z's boundary. Meanwhile, y can also touch z's boundary. So this scenario is consistent.

For TPPi(x,z):
- y is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
- y is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
- z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
This seems consistent. z can be entirely within x, touching x's boundary, and y can be within z, touching z's boundary (and possibly also x's boundary).

For NTPPi(x,z):
- y is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
- y is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary.
Is this consistent? If z doesn't touch x's boundary, can y (which is inside z) touch x's boundary? This seems inconsistent. If y touches x's boundary and y is inside z, then z must also touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider this case more carefully. We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.

Could we have NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x?

If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, then how could y touch x's boundary? It couldn't, because y would be completely surrounded by z, which doesn't touch x's boundary. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), which states that y touches x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
- y is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
- y is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
- x and z are the same region.
This is consistent. If x and z are the same, then y is a tangential proper part of both.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- NTPP (x is a non-tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

Actually, let me think again about NTPP. We said NTPP(x,z) means:
- x is fully contained in z.
- x does not touch z's boundary.

Given that TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y touches x's boundary), and TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y touches z's boundary), can we have a scenario where x is fully contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary?

If y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, and x is fully inside z, how can x not touch z's boundary? If y touches both boundaries, and y is inside both x and z, then it seems like x must also touch z's boundary. 

But I think I can make a specific example:
- Imagine z as a large circle.
- Imagine x as a smaller circle inside z, but not touching z's boundary.
- Imagine y as an even smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary.
- Now, extend y so that it's no longer a circle, but a more complex shape that reaches out to touch z's boundary while still being fully inside both x and z.

This seems to work! y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Wait, I think there's a problem with my example. If y is a proper part of x, then y is completely contained within x. If y touches z's boundary, and y is completely inside x, then x must also touch z's boundary.

Let me reconsider. The problem might be in my interpretation.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x (completely contained within x).
- y touches x's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z:
- y is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- y touches z's boundary.

Given these two, can we have NTPP(x,z)? This would mean:
- x is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- x does not touch z's boundary.

If y is completely contained within x, and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary (since x contains the part of y that touches z's boundary). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

Actually, hold on. I'm still not sure about NTPP. Let me try to visualize a different example.

First, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x:
- y is fully contained in x.
- y touches x's boundary.

Second, TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z:
- y is fully contained in z.
- y touches z's boundary.

Can we have NTPP(x,z), where x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
- x is fully contained in z.
- x does not touch z's boundary.

Let's imagine x as a smaller circle inside a larger circle z, but not touching z's boundary. Now, for y, we need something that's fully inside x and touches x's boundary, but also fully inside z and touches z's boundary.

Actually, I think it's not possible to have NTPP(x,z). If y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, and y is inside x, and x is inside z, then the part of y that touches z's boundary must also be part of x. Therefore, x must also touch z's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

Actually, I think I got confused by the way I was interpreting "touches the boundary." Let me be more precise.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x (completely contained within x).
- y's boundary touches x's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z:
- y is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- y's boundary touches z's boundary.

Given these two, can we have NTPP(x,z)? This would mean:
- x is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- x's boundary does not touch z's boundary.

If y's boundary touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, and y is inside x, and x is inside z, then x's boundary must also touch z's boundary (since y's boundary touches both). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

Actually, wait. I'm still not comfortable with my reasoning about NTPP(x,z). Let me construct a concrete counterexample to see if it's truly impossible.

Consider the following scenario:
- x is a disc with a radius of 2 units, centered at the origin.
- z is a disc with a radius of 4 units, centered at the point (3, 0).
- y is a disc with a radius of 1 unit, centered at the point (1, 0).

In this scenario:
- y is entirely contained within x, and y's boundary touches x's boundary at the point (2, 0).
- y is entirely contained within z, and y's boundary touches z's boundary at the point (2, 0).

So, TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are satisfied. But what's the relationship between x and z?

x is centered at the origin with a radius of 2, so its boundary is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 4.
z is centered at (3, 0) with a radius of 4, so its boundary is defined by the equation (x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 16.

Let's check if x is entirely contained within z:
The distance between the centers of x and z is 3 units. For x to be entirely inside z, this distance should be less than the radius of z minus the radius of x. That's 4 - 2 = 2. But the distance between the centers is 3, which is greater than 2. So, x is not entirely contained within z.

In fact, x and z overlap, but neither is contained within the other. This is a case of partial overlap (PO).

So, PO(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship, and I was correct to include it in my list.

But I'm still not convinced about NTPP(x,z). Let me try to construct a more specific example to check if it's possible or not.

Let's go back to the definition of these relations and see if we can derive a conclusion.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x):
- y is a proper part of x (completely contained within x).
- y's boundary touches x's boundary at at least one point.

TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- y's boundary touches z's boundary at at least one point.

NTPP(x,z):
- x is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- x's boundary does not touch z's boundary at any point.

If we assume NTPP(x,z), then x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But we also know that y is inside x and y touches z's boundary. This is a contradiction: if y is inside x, and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary (since the boundary of y is a subset of the boundary of x). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible given our constraints.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. The boundary of y is not a subset of the boundary of x. Just because y is inside x doesn't mean all of y's boundary is also inside x. In fact, for TPP, some part of y's boundary coincides with x's boundary.

Let me reconsider:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x):
- y is a proper part of x (completely contained within x).
- y's boundary touches x's boundary at at least one point.

TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- y's boundary touches z's boundary at at least one point.

NTPP(x,z):
- x is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- x's boundary does not touch z's boundary at any point.

If y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, but x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y must touch x's boundary at a different point than where it touches z's boundary. Is this possible?

Actually, I'm still not sure. Let me try to make a specific example.

Imagine z as a large circle with its boundary as the outermost ring. Inside z, we have a smaller circle x, whose boundary doesn't touch z's boundary. Inside x, we have an even smaller shape y. For TPPi(x,y), y should touch x's boundary. For TPP(y,z), y should touch z's boundary. But if y is completely inside x, and x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then how can y touch z's boundary? It can't.

So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible given our constraints.

Let's move on to NTPPi(x,z), which means NTPP(z,x):
- z is a proper part of x (completely contained within x).
- z's boundary does not touch x's boundary at any point.

Given that TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y touches z's boundary. And given TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches x's boundary.

If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, but y is inside z and y touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary. This contradicts the assumption that z doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible given our constraints.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

Ok, let me double-check my reasoning once more.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means:
- y is a proper part of x.
- y's boundary touches x's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z.
- y's boundary touches z's boundary.

From these, we can say:
- y is inside both x and z.
- y touches both the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. But we know y is in both x and z, so they must overlap. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) means x and z only touch at their boundaries. But we know y is in both x and z, so they overlap more than just at their boundaries. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x and z can overlap in such a way that y is in the overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible. We can have y inside x, with y touching both x's boundary and z's boundary, and x also touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary). If y is inside x and touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). This is possible. We can have y inside z, with y touching both z's boundary and x's boundary, and z also touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary). If y is inside z and touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region. This is possible. If x and z are the same, then y is a tangential proper part of both.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

Actually, wait. I think I'm misinterpreting "y's boundary touches x's boundary" in the TPP relation. Let me clarify what TPP means once more:

TPP(y,x) means:
- y is a proper part of x (completely contained within x).
- y shares at least one point with the boundary of x.

With this interpretation, let's reconsider the possibilities for NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z), we have:
- x is completely contained within z.
- x does not share any point with the boundary of z.

Given that TPPi(x,y) (which is the same as TPP(y,x)), y is inside x and shares at least one point with the boundary of x. And given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and shares at least one point with the boundary of z.

If y shares a point with the boundary of z, and y is completely inside x, and x is completely inside z, then x must also share that point with the boundary of z. This contradicts NTPP(x,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) (which is the same as NTPP(z,x)), we have:
- z is completely contained within x.
- z does not share any point with the boundary of x.

Given that TPP(y,z), y is inside z and shares at least one point with the boundary of z. And given TPPi(x,y) (which is the same as TPP(y,x)), y is inside x and shares at least one point with the boundary of x.

If y shares a point with the boundary of x, and y is completely inside z, and z is completely inside x, then z must also share that point with the boundary of x. This contradicts NTPPi(x,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I'm still convinced that the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

My reasoning is as follows:

I have two facts: TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). These mean:

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), which means:
- y is a proper part of x (completely contained within x).
- y touches the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (completely contained within z).
- y touches the boundary of z.

So, y is inside both x and z, and touches both of their boundaries.

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z. Here are the eight relations again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

Let's go through them one by one:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. But we know y is inside both x and z, so they must share at least the part y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected, they only touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. But again, y is inside both x and z, so they must share more than just boundary points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they share some parts but neither is fully contained in the other. This is consistent with our constraints. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, x is fully contained in z and touches the boundary of z. This is consistent with our constraints. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, x is fully contained in z but doesn't touch the boundary of z. Now, we know y is inside x and touches the boundary of z. If y is inside x and touches the boundary of z, then x must also touch the boundary of z (since the part of y that touches the boundary of z is also a part of x). This contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, z is fully contained in x and touches the boundary of x. This is consistent with our constraints. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, z is fully contained in x but doesn't touch the boundary of x. Now, we know y is inside z and touches the boundary of x. If y is inside z and touches the boundary of x, then z must also touch the boundary of x (since the part of y that touches the boundary of x is also a part of z). This contradicts NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, they are the same region. This is consistent with our constraints. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

Let me check the NTPP case once more, just to be absolutely sure.

For NTPP(x,z), we're saying:
- x is a proper part of z.
- x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary.

But we also know that:
- y is a proper part of x, and y's boundary touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)).
- y is a proper part of z, and y's boundary touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)).

So, y's boundary touches both x's boundary and z's boundary. If y is completely inside x, and y's boundary touches z's boundary, then the part of y that touches z's boundary is also part of x. Therefore, x must touch z's boundary at that point, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible, and the same reasoning applies to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO (Partial Overlap)
- TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ (x and z are equal)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's clarify what these relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

So y is inside both x and z, and touches both of their boundaries.

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least that part.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible for the same reason - they share interior points (at least y).

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap with y in the shared region.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If y is inside x and touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary (contradicting NTPP).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If y is inside z and touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary (contradicting NTPPi).

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z could be identical regions, both containing y.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
