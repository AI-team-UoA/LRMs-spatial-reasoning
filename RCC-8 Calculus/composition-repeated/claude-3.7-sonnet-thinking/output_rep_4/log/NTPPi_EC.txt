PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the information given to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

First, we have NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x). So y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

Second, we have EC(y,z), which means y and z are externally connected. That is, they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Given these two facts, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is entirely contained within x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at the boundary, we need to figure out where z can be in relation to x.

Let me go through the possible RCC-8 relations for x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Can x and z be completely disconnected? No, because z touches y, and y is inside x, so z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Can x and z touch at their boundaries? Yes, this is possible. If z touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside x but not touching x's boundary, then z could extend from y's boundary to x's boundary, just touching x at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Can x and z share some interior points? Yes, this is possible. z could overlap with part of x (including some parts where y isn't), while still touching y at the boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Can x be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary? No, this doesn't seem possible. Since y is inside x (not touching x's boundary) and z touches y, z would have to be inside x at least where it touches y. So x cannot be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Can x be a proper part of z without touching z's boundary? No, for similar reasons as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Can z be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary? Yes, this is possible. z could be completely inside x, touching y at the boundary and also touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Can z be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary? No, because z touches y at y's boundary, and y is not touching x's boundary, so z must extend at least to where y is, which is inside x and not touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Can x and z be the same region? No, because z touches y at y's boundary, while x completely contains y including y's boundary.

Wait, I need to reconsider NTPPi(x,z). I said it's not possible, but I think I made a mistake. Let's think again.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Can this happen? If y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at y's boundary, then z could still be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Actually, let me visualize this more carefully. If NTPPi(x,y), then y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If EC(y,z), then z touches y at their boundaries. Now, where can z be in relation to x?

1. z could be partially inside x and partially outside x, touching x at the boundary. This would be PO(x,z).
2. z could be completely inside x, touching x's boundary. This would be TPPi(x,z).
3. z could be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This would be NTPPi(x,z).
4. z could be completely outside x, touching x at the boundary. This would be EC(x,z).

DC(x,z) is not possible because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must at least touch x.
TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible because x must be larger than y (since y is a proper part of x), and z touches y, so x cannot be inside z.
EQ(x,z) is not possible because x and z have different relationships with y.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to double-check NTPPi(x,z). If y is inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at y's boundary, can z still be completely inside x without touching x's boundary?

Yes, this is possible. Imagine y as a circle completely inside a larger circle x, with a gap between y's boundary and x's boundary. Now, z could be another circle that touches y's boundary at a point, but is still completely contained within x and doesn't reach x's boundary.

Actually, I need to verify if EC(x,z) is actually possible. If y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at the boundary, can z touch x only at x's boundary?

No, that doesn't seem geometrically possible. If z touches y, which is completely inside x, then z must overlap with some interior part of x. So EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The issue is that I'm visualizing these regions in a 2D Euclidean space, but the RCC-8 relations can apply to more general topological spaces.

Given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), we know:
- y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary
- z touches y at their boundaries but they don't share interior points

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z:

First, it's clear that z must at least touch x, because z touches y and y is inside x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

If z touches y at the boundary, and y is strictly inside x, then z must at least partially overlap with the interior of x. This rules out EC(x,z).

Can z be completely inside x? Yes, z could be another region inside x that touches y.
Can z be tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.
Can z be non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Can x be part of z? If x is part of z, and y is part of x, then y would be part of z. But we know y and z are externally connected, so they don't have any parts in common. So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

Can x and z be equal? No, because y is part of x but not part of z (they're externally connected), so x and z must be different.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me verify that PO(x,z) is possible. In this case, x and z would share some interior points, but neither would be part of the other. This seems possible. z could extend from y's boundary to outside of x, sharing some interior with x but not being contained within it.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I made a conceptual error in my analysis. If EC(y,z), then y and z are connected but don't share any interior parts. If NTPPi(x,y), then y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Let me revise my thinking:

DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: If z touches y, and y is inside x, then z must at least touch x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries: If z touches y at y's boundary, and y is strictly inside x, then z would have to pass through x's interior to reach y. If z is touching x only at x's boundary, it couldn't also be touching y, which is strictly inside x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: This is possible. z could extend from y's boundary, through part of x, and beyond x's boundary.

TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Is this possible? If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y at y's boundary... this seems contradictory. If z touches y, which is strictly inside x, then z must overlap with x's interior. But if x is inside z, then z cannot be externally connected to y (which is inside x). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Similar to TPP, this is not possible.

TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible. z could be inside x, touching y at y's boundary and also touching x's boundary.

NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is possible. z could be completely inside x, touching y at y's boundary without touching x's boundary.

EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This is not possible because y is inside x but only externally connected to z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I've been overthinking this. Let me try a more direct approach.

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
Given EC(y,z), we know y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, since y is inside x and z touches y, z must at least touch or overlap with x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Can EC(x,z) be true? If z only touches x at the boundary, how can it also touch y, which is strictly inside x? It seems geometrically impossible, so EC(x,z) is not a valid relation.

Can PO(x,z) be true? Yes, z could overlap with part of x while also extending outside of x.

Can TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) be true? If x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, so these relations are not possible.

Can TPPi(x,z) be true? Yes, z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.

Can NTPPi(x,z) be true? Yes, z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Can EQ(x,z) be true? No, because y is inside x but only externally connected to z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm doubting myself now about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). If x is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x, then yes, y would be a proper part of z. But EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, which means they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. 

If y is a proper part of x, and x is a proper part of z, then y would share interior points with z, contradicting EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

Actually, I think I've been misunderstanding EC(y,z) in this context. Let's clarify:

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This means y and z have some boundary points in common, but their interiors are disjoint.

Now, if NTPPi(x,y), then y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This means all of y, including its boundary, is contained in the interior of x.

But if the boundary of y is in the interior of x, and z touches y at the boundary, then z must also penetrate the interior of x. This means EC(x,z) is not possible, because z would have to share interior points with x.

Similarly, if x were a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP), then y would also be a proper part of z, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this in a slightly different way.

If we have NTPPi(x,y), then:
- y is strictly inside x
- the boundary of y is in the interior of x

If we have EC(y,z), then:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share interior points

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: This is not possible. If z touches y at their boundaries, and y is strictly inside x, then z must at least touch or overlap with the interior of x.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries: This is not possible. If z touches y at their boundaries, and the boundary of y is in the interior of x, then z must overlap with the interior of x. So x and z cannot be merely externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: This is possible. z could extend from the boundary of y, through part of the interior of x, and beyond the boundary of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This is not possible. If x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, so this is a contradiction.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Similarly, this is not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible. z could be contained within x, touching both y at their boundaries and x at its boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is possible. z could be completely inside x, touching y at their boundaries without touching the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This is not possible. If x and z were the same region, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, so this is a contradiction.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I'm going to try once more, but with drawings:

Let me represent the scenario:

Scenario 1: z is partially overlapping with x (PO(x,z))
```
    +-----+
    |     |
+---|--+  |
|   |  |  |
|   +--+--+
|      |
+------+
```
where the outer larger rectangle is x, the inner rectangle is y, and the rectangle on the right is z.
NTPPi(x,y) is satisfied because y is completely inside x.
EC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z touch at their boundaries.
PO(x,z) is satisfied because x and z partially overlap.

Scenario 2: z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))
```
+--------+
|        |
|   +--+ |
|   |  | |
|   +--+-+
|      | |
+------+-+
       
```
where the outer larger rectangle is x, the inner left rectangle is y, and the inner right rectangle is z.
NTPPi(x,y) is satisfied because y is completely inside x.
EC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z touch at their boundaries.
TPPi(x,z) is satisfied because z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

Scenario 3: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))
```
+--------+
|        |
|   +--+ |
|   |  | |
|   +--+-+
|      | |
|      | |
+------+-+
```
where the outer larger rectangle is x, the inner left rectangle is y, and the inner right rectangle is z.
NTPPi(x,y) is satisfied because y is completely inside x.
EC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z touch at their boundaries.
NTPPi(x,z) is satisfied because z is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to go through the eight possible relationships once more, more methodically:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   If NTPPi(x,y), then y is strictly inside x.
   If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at their boundaries.
   If z touches y, and y is inside x, then z must at least touch or overlap with the interior of x.
   So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
   If the boundary of y is in the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and z touches y at the boundary (from EC(y,z)), then z must penetrate the interior of x.
   If z penetrates the interior of x, then x and z cannot be merely externally connected.
   So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   z could extend from the boundary of y, through part of the interior of x, and beyond the boundary of x.
   This scenario satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).
   So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   If x is inside z, and y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), then y would be inside z.
   But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, which contradicts y being inside z.
   So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   Similar to TPP, if x is strictly inside z, and y is strictly inside x, then y would be strictly inside z.
   But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, which contradicts y being inside z.
   So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   z could be contained within x, touching both y at their boundaries (from EC(y,z)) and x at its boundary.
   This scenario satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).
   So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   z could be completely inside x, touching y at their boundaries (from EC(y,z)) without touching the boundary of x.
   This scenario satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).
   So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   If x and z were the same region, and y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), then y would be inside z.
   But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, which contradicts y being inside z.
   So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm doubting myself a bit on EC(x,z). Let me think through it again.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Can EC(x,z) be true? This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

If y is completely inside x, and z touches y at their boundaries, can z also touch x only at x's boundary?

Imagine this: y is a circle completely inside a larger circle x. Now, z is a circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary. Can z also touch x only at x's boundary?

It seems unlikely in a 2D Euclidean space. If z touches y, which is strictly inside x, then z would have to penetrate the interior of x to reach y. If z is touching x only at x's boundary, it couldn't also be touching y, which is strictly inside x.

In a more abstract topological sense, if the boundary of y is in the interior of x, and z touches the boundary of y, then z must intersect the interior of x. So, x and z cannot be merely externally connected.

Thus, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

And actually, wait, let me double-check my understanding of EC. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would touch at their boundaries, but their interiors wouldn't overlap. If z touches y at their boundaries, and y is strictly inside x, then z must penetrate the interior of x to reach y. If z penetrates the interior of x, then x and z can't be externally connected (their interiors would overlap).

But I need to further think about the case PO(x,z). For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would partially overlap, meaning they share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.

If y is strictly inside x, and z touches y at the boundary, then z does indeed share some interior points with x. Additionally, for it to be partial overlap, z would need to extend beyond x, and x would need to have parts that z doesn't overlap with. This seems plausible.

So I'm quite confident that PO(x,z) is a valid relation.

I already confirmed that TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

So the final set of possible relationships between x and z is: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I want to check with a few examples to be sure:

First, let's confirm the starting positions:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, let's check each of the possible relations:

1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   Example: Imagine x as a large circle, y as a small circle completely inside x, and z as a circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary and extends partially outside of x.
   In this scenario, y is completely inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), y and z touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), and x and z partially overlap (PO(x,z)).
   This seems geometrically plausible, so PO(x,z) is a valid relation.

2. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   Example: Imagine x as a large circle, y as a small circle completely inside x, and z as a circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary and also touches the boundary of x.
   In this scenario, y is completely inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), y and z touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), and z is inside x and touches x's boundary (TPPi(x,z)).
   This seems geometrically plausible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid relation.

3. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Example: Imagine x as a large circle, y as a small circle completely inside x, and z as a circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary but is still completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   In this scenario, y is completely inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), y and z touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,z)).
   This seems geometrically plausible, so NTPPi(x,z) is a valid relation.

4. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
   Example: Can we find a scenario where y is completely inside x, y and z touch at their boundaries, and x and z only touch at their boundaries?
   If y is inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y, then z must penetrate the interior of x to reach y. This means x and z cannot be merely externally connected.
   So, EC(x,z) is not a valid relation.

I'm convinced that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me try once more with the EC(x,z) example, but considering a non-standard topology:

Imagine a space where the regions aren't necessarily simply connected. For instance, x could be a torus (donut shape), and y could be inside the hole of the torus but without touching it. Now, z could be a region that touches y at its boundary and extends to touch the inner boundary of the torus x.

In this case, z doesn't penetrate the "solid" part of x, and x and z only touch at their boundaries. But, is y really a non-tangential proper part of x in this scenario? The hole of a torus is not typically considered part of the torus, so y might not be inside x in the sense required by NTPPi(x,y).

I am going to revisit the precise definitions of RCC-8 relations to be sure.

Actually, I'm not sure if my torus example is valid in the RCC-8 calculus, as RCC-8 is usually applied to regions that are regular closed sets in a topological space. The interior of a torus doesn't include its hole, so a region inside the hole wouldn't be a proper part of the torus.

The confusion arises because the spatial relations in RCC-8 are based on connection, and the definition of connection might vary depending on the underlying topological space. In a standard topological interpretation, if NTPPi(x,y), then y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. If z touches y, which is inside x, then z must at least touch or overlap with the interior of x, meaning EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, for standard interpretations of RCC-8 in Euclidean space, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I am sticking with my final answer, though I am admittedly somewhat uncertain about the viability of EC(x,z) in unusual topological spaces. Since the standard interpretation of RCC-8 in Euclidean space seems to be what is being asked for here, and in that setting, EC(x,z) is not possible, I conclude that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

In order to resolve my doubts, I need to be clear about the definitions of the RCC-8 relations in terms of the primitive relation C(x,y), which means x and y are connected.

1. DC(x,y): not C(x,y) - x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): C(x,y) and not O(x,y) - x and y are externally connected.
3. PO(x,y): O(x,y) and not P(x,y) and not P(y,x) - x and y partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,y): P(x,y) and not PP(x,y) - x is a tangential proper part of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): PP(x,y) and not O(x,¬y) - x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): P(y,x) and not PP(y,x) - y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): PP(y,x) and not O(y,¬x) - y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): P(x,y) and P(y,x) - x and y are equal.

where:
- O(x,y) means x and y overlap, i.e., they share a part.
- P(x,y) means x is part of y.
- PP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y.
- ¬y denotes the complement of y.

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), we know y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any parts.

Now, let's consider all possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If y is inside x and z touches y, then z must at least touch x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   If y is inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y, then z must overlap with the interior of x. This means x and z can't be merely externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   z could extend from the boundary of y, through part of the interior of x, and beyond the boundary of x. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share any parts, which is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP, if x is strictly inside z, and y is strictly inside x, then y would be strictly inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share any parts, which is a contradiction. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   z could be inside x, touching both y at their boundaries and x at its boundary. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   z could be completely inside x, touching y at their boundaries without touching the boundary of x. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z were the same region, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share any parts, which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just want to double-check the EC relation once more. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any parts. Let's think about what this means in terms of the primitive relations:

EC(y,z) means C(y,z) and not O(y,z).

C(y,z) means y and z are connected.
O(y,z) means y and z overlap, i.e., they share a part.

So, EC(y,z) means y and z are connected but don't overlap. In a standard topological interpretation, this means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Now, if y is inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y at the boundary, can z touch x only at x's boundary (which would make EC(x,z) true)?

If z touches y at y's boundary, and y's boundary is in the interior of x, then z must penetrate the interior of x to reach y. If z penetrates the interior of x, then x and z can't be merely externally connected (they would share interior points). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, I maintain that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just realized that it's possible that I've been thinking too concretely, confining myself to specific 2D or 3D Euclidean geometries, when the RCC-8 calculus is more general. Let me try once more with a different approach.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the relations are based on the concept of connection, which is a primitive relation between regions. If two regions x and y are connected, we write C(x,y). The RCC-8 relations are defined in terms of C and other derived relations.

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), we know y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, let's consider all possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If y is inside x and z touches y, then z must at least touch x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   If y is inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y, can x and z be externally connected?
   For x and z to be externally connected, they would touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. But if z touches y, and y is inside x, then z must penetrate the interior of x to reach y. If z penetrates the interior of x, then x and z can't be merely externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   z could extend from the boundary of y, through part of the interior of x, and beyond the boundary of x. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, which is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP, if x is strictly inside z, and y is strictly inside x, then y would be strictly inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, which is a contradiction. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   z could be inside x, touching both y at their boundaries and x at its boundary. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   z could be completely inside x, touching y at their boundaries without touching the boundary of x. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z were the same region, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, I am confident that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

To reinforce, here are my reasoning:

1. PO(x,z) is possible because z can overlap with part of x and extend beyond x.
2. TPPi(x,z) is possible because z can be inside x and touch both y and the boundary of x.
3. NTPPi(x,z) is possible because z can be inside x without touching the boundary of x, but still touching y.
4. All other relations (DC, EC, TPP, NTPP, EQ) are not possible due to the constraints given by NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I got it now, but I'm going to do one more careful analysis.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, let's determine what can x's relationship with z be:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
   Since z touches y, and y is inside x, z must at least touch or penetrate x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, then z penetrates the interior of x. This means x and z share interior points, not just boundary points. Hence, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. 
   This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. 
   If z touches y's boundary and extends beyond x, this scenario is possible. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is contained in z and touches z's boundary, and y is contained in x, then y is contained in z. This contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z only touch at their boundaries. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP, if x is contained in z without touching z's boundary, and y is contained in x, then y is contained in z. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. If z touches y's boundary, this scenario is possible without contradicting NTPPi(x,y) or EC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is contained in x without touching x's boundary. If z touches y's boundary, this scenario is possible without contradicting NTPPi(x,y) or EC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   If x and z are the same, and y is contained in x, then y is contained in z. This contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z only touch at their boundaries. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Conclusion: The possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

So my final answer is: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. If z touches y, and y is inside x, then z must at least touch or overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. If y is inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y at the boundary, then z must penetrate the interior of x, so x and z cannot be merely externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z could extend from y's boundary, through part of x's interior, and beyond x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be inside x, touching both y's boundary and x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be completely inside x, touching y's boundary without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
