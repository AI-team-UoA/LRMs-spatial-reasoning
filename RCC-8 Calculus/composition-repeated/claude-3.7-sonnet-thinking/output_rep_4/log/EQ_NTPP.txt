PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

I have two given relations:
1. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they have the same spatial extent.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely within z without touching z's boundary.

Now I need to determine the relation between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy exactly the same spatial region. And since NTPP(y,z), y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

To verify this, let's check if any other relation between x and z is possible:

1. DC(x,z)? No, because x coincides with y, and y is inside z, so x cannot be disconnected from z.
2. EC(x,z)? No, because y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x coincides with y, so x can't touch z's boundary either.
3. PO(x,z)? No, because x coincides with y, and y is completely inside z, so x can't partially overlap with z - it must be completely inside it.
4. TPP(x,z)? No, because y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x coincides with y, so x can't touch z's boundary either. Thus it can't be a tangential proper part.
5. NTPP(x,z)? Yes, as established earlier.
6. TPPi(x,z)? No, because that would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, but we know y is inside z, and x coincides with y, so x can't contain z.
7. NTPPi(x,z)? No, because that would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, but we know y is inside z, and x coincides with y, so x can't contain z.
8. EQ(x,z)? No, because y is a proper part of z, and x coincides with y, so x can't coincide with z.

So the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning. If EQ(x,y), then x and y are spatially identical. If NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Since x and y are identical, x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z).

The answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relations transfer given the constraints.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (same spatial region)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

Since x and y occupy exactly the same space (EQ(x,y)), and y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

This means that the only possible relationship between x and z is:
- NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
