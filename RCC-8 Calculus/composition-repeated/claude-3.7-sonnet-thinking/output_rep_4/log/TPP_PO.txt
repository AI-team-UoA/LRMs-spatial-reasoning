PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what the relations TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) tell us.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y partially overlaps with z. So y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since x is inside y, and y partially overlaps with z, there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. x could be completely inside the overlapping part of y and z. In this case, x would be part of z, making either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) possible, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.

2. x could be completely outside the overlapping part of y and z. In this case, x would be disconnected from z, making DC(x,z) possible.

3. x could partially overlap with the overlapping part of y and z. In this case, PO(x,z) would be the relationship.

4. x could touch the boundary of z without sharing any interior parts. In this case, EC(x,z) would be the relationship.

Let's visualize these cases to make sure they're all valid:

Case 1: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
If x is completely inside the overlapping part of y and z, then x would be part of z. If x touches the boundary of z, it would be TPP(x,z). If x does not touch the boundary of z, it would be NTPP(x,z).

Case 2: DC(x,z)
If x is completely outside the overlapping part of y and z, and doesn't touch z, then x would be disconnected from z, making DC(x,z) the relationship.

Case 3: PO(x,z)
If x partially overlaps with the overlapping part of y and z, then x and z would share a spatial part, but neither would be part of the other, making PO(x,z) the relationship.

Case 4: EC(x,z)
If x touches the boundary of z without sharing any interior parts, then EC(x,z) would be the relationship.

I need to check if all of these are actually valid given the conditions TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and touches y's boundary. PO(y,z) means y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Case 1: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
This means x is inside z (and possibly touches z's boundary). Since x is inside y (and touches y's boundary), and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be inside the overlapping part of y and z. So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are valid possibilities.

Case 2: DC(x,z)
This means x is disconnected from z. Since x is inside y (and touches y's boundary), and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Case 3: PO(x,z)
This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since x is inside y (and touches y's boundary), and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to partially overlap with the overlapping part of y and z. So PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Case 4: EC(x,z)
This means x touches the boundary of z without sharing any interior parts. Since x is inside y (and touches y's boundary), and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to touch the boundary of z. So EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me check if any other relations could be possible.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since x is a tangential proper part of y, this would imply that z is also part of y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But since x is a tangential proper part of y, this would also imply that z is part of y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident. But since x is a tangential proper part of y, and y partially overlaps with z, this would imply that z is also a tangential proper part of y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check by thinking more about what TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) mean.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is a proper part of y (x is entirely contained within y) and x touches the boundary of y.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. There is a non-empty intersection between y and z, but neither is contained within the other.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect. This is possible if x touches the boundary of the overlapping part of y and z.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x is in the overlapping part of y and z, and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping part of y and z, and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping part of y and z, and x does not touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because it would mean z is contained within x, and x is contained within y, which would imply that z is contained within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap, with neither contained within the other.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is not possible because it would mean z is equal to x, and x is contained within y, which would imply that z is contained within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap, with neither contained within the other.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think again about whether TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) or EQ(x,z) are possible.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is a proper part of y (x is entirely contained within y) and x touches the boundary of y.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. There is a non-empty intersection between y and z, but neither is contained within the other.

Now, let's consider the relationships:

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean that z is entirely contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x. But since x is entirely contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean that z is also entirely contained within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z partially overlap, with neither contained within the other. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean that z is entirely contained within x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. But since x is entirely contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean that z is also entirely contained within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z partially overlap, with neither contained within the other. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are equal. This would mean that x and z occupy the exact same space. But since x is entirely contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean that z is also entirely contained within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z partially overlap, with neither contained within the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this again.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. This means that y and z share some space, but neither is completely inside the other.

Since TPP(x,y), we know x is completely inside y. Since PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some space, but neither is completely inside the other. Let's consider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z.

DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect. This is possible if x touches the boundary of the overlapping part of y and z.

PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x is in the overlapping part of y and z, and part of x is outside z.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping part of y and z, and x touches the boundary of z.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping part of y and z, and x does not touch the boundary of z.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would have to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since TPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. So if z is completely inside x, then z is also completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap, with neither completely inside the other. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would have to be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. But since TPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. So if z is completely inside x, then z is also completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap, with neither completely inside the other. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. For this to be true, x and z would have to occupy the exact same space. But since TPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. So if z is equal to x, then z is also completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap, with neither completely inside the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me reason about the cases with diagrams to be sure.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. Let's imagine y as a big circle, and x as a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. Let's imagine z as another big circle that overlaps with y, but neither is inside the other.

Now, where can x be in relation to z?

1. x could be in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. In this case, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).

2. x could be in the part of y that touches z's boundary. In this case, x and z externally connect, so EC(x,z).

3. x could be partially in the overlapping part of y and z. In this case, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

4. x could be completely in the overlapping part of y and z, and touching z's boundary. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z).

5. x could be completely in the overlapping part of y and z, not touching z's boundary. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z).

It seems like TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible. Let's double-check:

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But since x is completely inside y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither completely inside the other.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since x is completely inside y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither completely inside the other.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would have to be equal. This means x and z occupy the exact same space. But since x is completely inside y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither completely inside the other.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I should probably clarify a bit more here.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. In other words, y and z share some region, but neither is contained within the other.

The crucial thing to understand here is that y and z share a region due to PO(y,z), and we need to consider the various ways that x can be positioned relative to this shared region and the separate regions of y and z.

Let's consider each of the 8 RCC relations as possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is located in a part of y that does not overlap with z. TPP(x,y) says that x is contained within y, but it doesn't specify where within y, so x could be in a part of y that is separate from z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect (touch). This is possible if x is located in a part of y such that x touches the boundary of the overlapping region of y and z. Since TPP(x,y) says that x touches the boundary of y, and that boundary might be where y and z meet, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x crosses the boundary of the overlapping region of y and z. Part of x is in z, and part of x is outside z (but still within y). So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and x touches the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean that z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x. But since x is entirely contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean that z is also entirely contained within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z partially overlap, with neither entirely contained within the other. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean that z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x. But since x is entirely contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean that z is also entirely contained within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z partially overlap, with neither entirely contained within the other. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This would mean that x and z occupy the exact same space. But since x is entirely contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean that z is also entirely contained within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z partially overlap, with neither entirely contained within the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually let me be even more careful. We have the relationships TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z). I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is contained within y and touches y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share a region, but neither is contained within the other.

Let's analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is located in a part of y that does not overlap with z. Since TPP(x,y) allows x to be anywhere within y as long as x touches y's boundary, x could be in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This is possible if x touches the boundary of z. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, x could be positioned such that it touches the boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x is in z and part is outside z. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, x could be positioned such that it partially overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be in the overlapping region of y and z such that it's entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z and does not touch the boundary of z. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be in the overlapping region of y and z such that it's entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. But since x is entirely within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also entirely within y. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither entirely within the other. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since x is entirely within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also entirely within y. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither entirely within the other. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This would mean x and z occupy the exact same space. But since x is entirely within y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also entirely within y. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither entirely within the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, hang on. Let me think through TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) again.

Situation: TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share a region, but neither is contained within the other.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. But since x is contained within y (due to TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also contained within y. This contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap and neither is contained within the other. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained within x and does not touch x's boundary. Again, since x is contained within y, this would mean z is also contained within y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would have to be the same region. But since x is contained within y (due to TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also contained within y. This contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap and neither is contained within the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, there's something I'd like to consider further, just to make sure. Let's think about TPPi(x,z) and PO(y,z) together. If TPPi(x,z) is true, then z is a tangential proper part of x. And if TPP(x,y) is true, then x is a tangential proper part of y. The potential concern is whether these two conditions imply that z is a proper part of y, which would contradict PO(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- Hypothetical TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

If both of these are true, then z is a proper part of x, and x is a proper part of y. By transitivity, z is a proper part of y. This means z is contained within y. But PO(y,z) says that y and z partially overlap, with neither contained within the other. This is a contradiction.

So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's do the same for NTPPi(x,z):

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- Hypothetical NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

If both of these are true, then z is a proper part of x, and x is a proper part of y. By transitivity, z is a proper part of y. This means z is contained within y. But PO(y,z) says that y and z partially overlap, with neither contained within the other. This is a contradiction.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Finally, let's consider EQ(x,z):

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- Hypothetical EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

If both of these are true, then x and z are the same region, and x is a proper part of y. This means z is also a proper part of y. But PO(y,z) says that y and z partially overlap, with neither contained within the other. This is a contradiction.

So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's double-check these five relations to see if they're all valid.

DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect. This is possible if x touches the boundary of z.

PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x is in z and part is outside z.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be in the overlapping region of y and z such that it's entirely within z and touches z's boundary. 

Actually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully.

We have TPP(x,y), which means x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary. And we have PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would have to be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary. Since x is entirely contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), x would have to be in the overlapping region of y and z. And since x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), it would need to touch a part of y's boundary that is also within z, for x to be entirely within z.

Is this possible? Let's think about it. We have PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap. This means there's a region that's in both y and z. If x is in this overlapping region and touches the boundary of this region that's part of y's boundary, then x could be entirely within z and touch z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be in the overlapping region of y and z such that it's entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems possible, but let's double-check.

We have TPP(x,y), which means x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary. And we have PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would have to be entirely contained within z and not touch z's boundary. Since x is entirely contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), x would have to be in the overlapping region of y and z. And since x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), it would need to touch a part of y's boundary that is inside z, not on the boundary of z.

Is this possible? We have PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap. This means there's a region that's in both y and z. If x is in this overlapping region and touches a part of y's boundary that's inside z, then x could be entirely within z and not touch z's boundary. 

Actually, hang on.

Let's denote the boundary of a region r as b(r), and the interior of a region as i(r).

TPP(x,y) means:
1. x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is entirely contained within y)
2. x touches the boundary of y (i.e., b(x) ∩ b(y) ≠ ∅)

PO(y,z) means:
1. y and z share a region (i.e., y ∩ z ≠ ∅)
2. Neither is a proper part of the other (i.e., y ⊈ z and z ⊈ y)

Let's revisit NTPP(x,z), which means:
1. x is a proper part of z (i.e., x is entirely contained within z)
2. x does not touch the boundary of z (i.e., b(x) ∩ b(z) = ∅)

Given TPP(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. But the boundary of y includes both the part of the boundary that's shared with z and the part that's not shared with z.

If x touches the part of y's boundary that's not shared with z, then x would be touching a part of y's boundary that's inside z. This would make NTPP(x,z) possible.

So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, I think I need to be even more careful. Let's denote the boundary of a region r as b(r), and the interior of a region as i(r).

TPP(x,y) means:
1. x is a proper part of y (i.e., x ⊂ y)
2. x touches the boundary of y (i.e., b(x) ∩ b(y) ≠ ∅)

PO(y,z) means:
1. y and z share a region (i.e., y ∩ z ≠ ∅)
2. Neither is a proper part of the other (i.e., y ⊈ z and z ⊈ y)

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means x ∩ z = ∅. This is possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. Since TPP(x,y) only specifies that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, it's possible for x to be in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This means i(x) ∩ i(z) = ∅ but b(x) ∩ b(z) ≠ ∅. This is possible if x touches the boundary of z. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be positioned such that it touches the boundary of z. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means x ∩ z ≠ ∅, but neither is a proper part of the other. This is possible if part of x is in z and part is outside z. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be positioned such that it partially overlaps with z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x ⊂ z and b(x) ∩ b(z) ≠ ∅. This is possible if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be in the overlapping region of y and z such that it's entirely within z and touches z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x ⊂ z and b(x) ∩ b(z) = ∅. This is possible if x is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary. Given that x is within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be in the overlapping region of y and z such that it's entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. 

Wait, but if TPP(x,y), then x touches the boundary of y. If x is also entirely within z, then the part of y's boundary that x touches must be inside z. But that would mean z contains a part of y's boundary, which is possible with PO(y,z).

Here's what's possible: y and z overlap in such a way that a part of y's boundary is inside z. x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches that part of y's boundary that's inside z. This way, x is entirely within z but doesn't touch z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, actually let me think about NTPP(x,z) again.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would have to be entirely contained within z and not touch z's boundary. Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So, for NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to:
1. Be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z.
2. Touch a part of y's boundary that's inside z, not on the boundary of z.

Is this possible? Let's visualize it:
- y is a region with a boundary.
- z is another region that partially overlaps with y.
- x is a smaller region that's entirely inside y and touches y's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, this means the part of y's boundary that x touches must be inside z. 

Is it possible for part of y's boundary to be inside z? Yes, because PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. The overlapping region can include a part of y's boundary. If x touches that part of y's boundary, then x is touching a boundary of y that's inside z, not on the boundary of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I think I'm overthinking this. Let me summarize.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): This is possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
- EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches the boundary of z.
- PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x is in z and part is outside z.
- TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For the other relations:
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because it would imply z is a proper part of y, which contradicts PO(y,z).
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because it would imply z is a proper part of y, which contradicts PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's make sure all of these are valid.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is it possible for x to be entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)) and yet completely disconnected from z? Given PO(y,z), there's a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. If x is located in this part of y, then DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect. Is it possible for x to be entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)) and yet only externally connect with z? Given PO(y,z), there's a boundary between the part of y that overlaps with z and the part that doesn't. If x is located such that it touches this boundary, then EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Is it possible for x to be entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)) and yet partially overlap with z? Given PO(y,z), there's a part of y that overlaps with z. If x is located such that part of it is in this overlapping region and part is outside, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Is it possible for x to be entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)) and yet be a tangential proper part of z? Given PO(y,z), there's a part of y that overlaps with z. If x is located entirely within this overlapping region and touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Is it possible for x to be entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)) and yet be a non-tangential proper part of z? Given PO(y,z), there's a part of y that overlaps with z. If x is located entirely within this overlapping region and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, all five of these relations are valid possibilities.

Actually, let's continue to check. For DC(x,z), this means x and z are disconnected. They share no points. For TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. For PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap. So if x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then DC(x,z) is true. This is possible.

For EC(x,z), this means x and z externally connect. They share boundary points but no interior points. For TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. For PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap. If x is located such that it touches the boundary of the overlapping region of y and z, then EC(x,z) is true. This is possible.

For PO(x,z), this means x and z partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. For TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. For PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap. If x is located such that part of it is in the overlapping region of y and z and part is in the non-overlapping part of y, then PO(x,z) is true. This is possible.

For TPP(x,z), this means x is a tangential proper part of z. x is inside z and touches z's boundary. For TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. For PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap. If x is located entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is true. 

Actually, wait.  Let's be precise. TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, x would need to be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and it would need to touch the boundary of z. But TPP(x,y) means x touches the boundary of y. Can x touch both the boundary of y and the boundary of z? Yes, if the boundaries of y and z intersect, and x touches that intersection. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), this means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. For PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap. For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and it would need to not touch the boundary of z. But TPP(x,y) means x touches the boundary of y. Can x touch the boundary of y but not the boundary of z? Yes, if x touches a part of y's boundary that's inside z, not on the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually this is beginning to seem circular. Let me try to be more precise.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. This means they share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.

Let's analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means they share no points.
   - For this to be true, x would need to be in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
   - Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely within y, so it can be in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
   - So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This means they share boundary points but no interior points.
   - For this to be true, x would need to touch the boundary of z but not share any interior points with z.
   - Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely within y, so it can be positioned such that it touches the boundary of the overlapping region of y and z.
   - So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
   - For this to be true, x would need to share some interior points with z, but not be entirely contained within z or vice versa.
   - Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely within y, so it can be positioned such that part of it is in the overlapping region of y and z and part is in the non-overlapping part of y.
   - So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.
   - For this to be true, x would need to be entirely within z and touch z's boundary.
   - Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.
   - For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and it would need to touch the boundary of z.
   - This is possible if x touches a part of the boundary of z that's inside y. Alternatively, x can touch the intersection of the boundaries of y and z.
   - So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - For this to be true, x would need to be entirely within z and not touch z's boundary.
   - Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.
   - For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and it would need to not touch the boundary of z. But it still needs to touch the boundary of y.
   - This is possible if x touches a part of y's boundary that's inside z, not on the boundary of z.
   - So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
   - For this to be true, z would need to be entirely within x and touch x's boundary.
   - Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely within y.
   - If z is entirely within x, then z would also be entirely within y.
   - But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither being entirely contained within the other.
   - So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - For this to be true, z would need to be entirely within x and not touch x's boundary.
   - Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely within y.
   - If z is entirely within x, then z would also be entirely within y.
   - But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither being entirely contained within the other.
   - So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means they occupy the exact same space.
   - For this to be true, x and z would need to be the same region.
   - Given TPP(x,y), x is entirely within y.
   - If z is the same as x, then z would also be entirely within y.
   - But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither being entirely contained within the other.
   - So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

(double checking)

DC(x,z) means x and z share no points. This is possible if x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

EC(x,z) means x and z share boundary points but no interior points. This is possible if x touches the boundary of the overlapping region of y and z, but isn't inside the overlapping region.

PO(x,z) means x and z share interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible if part of x is in the overlapping region of y and z, and part of x is outside z (but still within y).

TPP(x,z) means x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and x touches the boundary of z.

NTPP(x,z) means x is entirely within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

TPPi(x,z) means z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x. Since x is entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also entirely within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither being entirely contained within the other. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Since x is entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also entirely within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither being entirely contained within the other. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region. Since x is entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is also entirely within y. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap, with neither being entirely contained within the other. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z when TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) are given.

Starting with what we know:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some region, but neither is contained within the other)

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x is located in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches the boundary between the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of y and z.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x partially extends into the overlapping region of y and z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and doesn't touch z's boundary. (This can happen if x touches a part of y's boundary that's inside z.)

The remaining relations - TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) - are not possible because they would all require z to be contained within y (contradicting PO(y,z)).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
