PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. This means they share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP, so it means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary.

I need to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about the spatial arrangement:
- y partially overlaps with x (so some of y is inside x, some is outside)
- z is fully inside y and touches y's boundary

What are the possible ways x and z could relate?

1. If z is in the part of y that overlaps with x, then z could partially overlap with x (PO).
2. If z is fully within the overlapping region of x and y, then z would be a proper part of x, either TPP or NTPP depending on whether z touches x's boundary.
3. If z is completely outside the overlapping region (in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x), then x and z would be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC).
4. If z straddles the boundary between the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of y, then z would partially overlap with x (PO).

Let me check more carefully:

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap.

So the situation is:
- z is fully inside y and touches y's boundary
- x partially overlaps with y

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of the overlap.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This is possible if z is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x, but z touches the boundary of the overlap region.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z straddles the boundary between the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y and z is fully inside y, it's not possible for x to be fully inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this is not possible given the constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully within the overlapping region of x and y, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully within the overlapping region of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x partially overlaps with y, but z is fully inside y. They can't both overlap with y and be equal.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me double check by reasoning more carefully:

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is fully inside z and touches z's boundary.

Wait, I made a mistake. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. So y is inside z, not z inside y. Let me reconsider.

So the situation is:
- y is fully inside z and touches z's boundary
- x partially overlaps with y

Now, let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Since y is fully inside z and x overlaps with y, x must also overlap or touch z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This is possible if x only overlaps with the part of y that touches z's boundary, and the rest of x is outside z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x is inside z (due to the overlap with y) and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is fully inside z and x only partially overlaps with y, it's not possible for z to be fully inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to TPPi, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x partially overlaps with y, but y is fully inside z. If x and z were equal, then x would fully contain y, contradicting PO(x,y).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, I still don't have a good grip on the spatial configuration. Let me re-interpret these relationships more carefully.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. This means they share some region, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPPi(y,z): This means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

So the spatial arrangement is:
- x and y have some overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

I need to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's visualize it. Since y is fully contained in z, the overlap between x and y is also contained in z. But there's also a part of x that's not overlapping with y, and this part could be inside z, outside z, or partially inside and partially outside z.

Let's consider each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Since y is inside z and x overlaps with y, x and z must have some connection. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This is possible if the only part of x that touches z is at the boundary of y, and the rest of x is outside z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x is inside z (due to the overlap with y) and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is fully inside x. But since y is fully inside z and x only partially overlaps with y, it's not possible for z to be fully inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to TPPi, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x partially overlaps with y, but y is fully inside z. If x and z were equal, then x would fully contain y, contradicting PO(x,y).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me verify this once more.

If PO(x,y), then x and y share some parts, but neither is a subset of the other. There's a part of x not in y, a part of y not in x, and a part shared by both.

If TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's decompose the space into regions:
- Region A: The part of x that overlaps with y.
- Region B: The part of x that's not in y.
- Region C: The part of y that's not in x.

Since y is fully contained in z, regions A and C are inside z. Region B, which is a part of x, can either be inside z, outside z, or partially inside and outside z.

If region B is entirely inside z, then x is fully contained in z. Depending on whether x touches z's boundary, x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).

If region B is entirely outside z, then x and z partially overlap (PO).

If region B is partially inside and partially outside z, then x and z also partially overlap (PO).

If region B is entirely outside z but touches z's boundary, then x and z externally connect (EC).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me double-check this by considering some specific spatial arrangements:

1. If y is a small region that touches the boundary of z, and x overlaps with y only at the boundary of z, then x and z could be externally connected (EC).

2. If y is inside z away from z's boundary, and x overlaps with y, then x could be entirely inside z without touching its boundary, making x a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).

3. If y touches the boundary of z, and x overlaps with y in such a way that x also touches the boundary of z, then x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP).

4. If x extends beyond z in some parts while overlapping with y inside z, then x and z partially overlap (PO).

So, our conclusion holds: the possible relations between x and z are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, let me think more carefully again. I think there's a flaw in my reasoning. I believe the issue lies in the way I'm envisioning the overlap of x and y.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Let's be very explicit about what PO(x,y) means. It means there's a region that's part of both x and y, but neither x is a subset of y nor y is a subset of x. This means there's a part of x that's not in y, and there's a part of y that's not in x.

Now, since TPPi(y,z), y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. This means all of y, including the part that overlaps with x and the part that doesn't, is inside z and touching z's boundary.

So, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since part of x overlaps with y, and all of y is inside z, this part of x is definitely inside z. The question then becomes: what about the part of x that doesn't overlap with y?

1. If this part of x is entirely inside z, then all of x is inside z. Depending on whether x touches z's boundary, x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).

2. If this part of x is entirely outside z, then x and z partially overlap (PO).

3. If this part of x is partially inside and partially outside z, then x and z also partially overlap (PO).

4. If this part of x is entirely outside z but touches z's boundary, then x and z could be either externally connected (EC) or partially overlapping (PO), depending on the specifics.

Let's re-evaluate these cases:

Case 1: If all of x is inside z, then x is a proper part of z. If x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z). If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

Case 2: If part of x is outside z, then either PO(x,z) if x and z share some interior, or EC(x,z) if they only touch at the boundary.

Actually, I'm not sure if EC(x,z) is possible. Let's think about it: If EC(x,z), then x and z only touch at the boundary and don't share any interior. But we know that part of x overlaps with y, and all of y is inside z. This means x and z share some interior, which contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me visualize this in a slightly different way. Let's think of the space in terms of regions:
- Region A: The part of x that's also part of y.
- Region B: The part of x that's not part of y.
- Region C: The part of y that's not part of x.
- Region D: The part of z that's not part of y.

Given PO(x,y), regions A, B, and C are non-empty. Given TPPi(y,z), regions C and A are fully inside z, and region D exists with y touching its boundary.

Now, the question is about the relationship between regions A + B (which is x) and regions A + C + D (which is z).

Region A is shared between x and z. The relationship between x and z depends on the position of region B:

1. If region B is entirely inside region D, then all of x is inside z, leading to either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

2. If region B is entirely outside regions C and D, then x and z share only region A, which means they partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

3. If region B overlaps with region D but also extends outside z, then x and z share more than just region A but less than all of x, which also leads to PO(x,z).

4. If region B only touches the boundary of z without entering region D, then the only part of x inside z is region A. This still means x and z share an interior, so PO(x,z).

5. What about EC(x,z)? This would mean x and z only touch at the boundary and don't share any interior. But we know region A is shared by x and z, which means they share an interior. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, let me reconsider the EC case. If x and y are partially overlapping, and y is a tangential proper part of z, can x and z be externally connected?

If x and z are externally connected, they only touch at the boundary and don't share any interior. But if x and y share some interior (due to PO(x,y)), and y is fully inside z, then x and z must share some interior, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So, EC(x,z) is definitely not possible.

Let me make sure that PO(x,z) is possible:
If x and y partially overlap, and y is fully inside z, then the overlapping region of x and y is inside z. But there's also a part of x outside y. If this part is outside z, then x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z) is possible.

Let me make sure that TPP(x,z) is possible:
If all of x is inside z (including the part that overlaps with y and the part that doesn't), and x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is valid.

Let me make sure that NTPP(x,z) is possible:
If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is valid.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Hmm. Actually, I'm still not sure about EC. Let's reconsider. The question is: can x and z share a boundary point without sharing any interior points?

Since y is a tangential proper part of z, y touches the boundary of z. If x and y partially overlap, there's a part of x inside y. This part of x is also inside z, so x and z share some interior.

But what if the only part of x that overlaps with y is the part of y that touches z's boundary? Even in this case, since y is a proper part of z, any point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of z is a boundary point of both y and z. And if x overlaps with y at this point, then x and z also share this boundary point. But since y is a proper part of z, the interior of y is in the interior of z. So if x overlaps with y, then x and z must share some interior.

So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Hmm, let's try a completely different approach to check if these are indeed the only valid relations.

If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points but neither is a subset of the other.
If TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is fully inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's denote the interior of a region as int(region) and the boundary as bd(region).

Given PO(x,y):
- int(x) ∩ int(y) ≠ ∅ (x and y share some interior points)
- int(x) - int(y) ≠ ∅ (there are points in the interior of x that are not in the interior of y)
- int(y) - int(x) ≠ ∅ (there are points in the interior of y that are not in the interior of x)

Given TPPi(y,z):
- int(y) ⊂ int(z) (the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z)
- bd(y) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅ (y touches the boundary of z)

For DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- This requires x ∩ z = ∅.
- But int(x) ∩ int(y) ≠ ∅ and int(y) ⊂ int(z), so int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅.
- This contradicts DC(x,z), so it's not possible.

For EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- This requires int(x) ∩ int(z) = ∅ and x ∩ z ≠ ∅.
- But as we've shown, int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅, so EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- This requires int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅, int(x) - int(z) ≠ ∅, and int(z) - int(x) ≠ ∅.
- We already know int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅.
- If the part of x not in y is not in z, then int(x) - int(z) ≠ ∅.
- Since y is a proper part of z, there's a part of z not in y. If this part doesn't overlap with x, then int(z) - int(x) ≠ ∅.
- So, PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- This requires int(x) ⊂ int(z) and bd(x) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅.
- If all of x is inside z, including the part not in y, then int(x) ⊂ int(z).
- If x touches the boundary of z, then bd(x) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅.
- So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- This requires int(x) ⊂ int(z) and bd(x) ∩ bd(z) = ∅.
- If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then this is satisfied.
- So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- This requires int(z) ⊂ int(x) and bd(x) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅.
- But int(y) ⊂ int(z) and int(y) - int(x) ≠ ∅, so int(z) - int(x) ≠ ∅.
- This contradicts int(z) ⊂ int(x), so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- Similar to TPPi, this is not possible because int(z) is not a subset of int(x).

For EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
- This requires int(x) = int(z) and bd(x) = bd(z).
- But int(y) ⊂ int(z) and int(y) - int(x) ≠ ∅, so int(z) - int(x) ≠ ∅.
- This contradicts int(x) = int(z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But let me think about EC once more, because I'm still not fully convinced of my reasoning.

If EC(x,z), then x and z only touch at the boundary and don't share any interior. But given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we've established that x and z must share some interior (the part of x that overlaps with y is inside z). This contradicts EC(x,z), so it's not possible.

Actually, wait. When I say "the part of x that overlaps with y is inside z", I'm assuming that the "overlap" means sharing some interior. But let's be extra precise. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior. This shared interior is inside y, and since y is a tangential proper part of z, this shared interior is also inside z. This means x and z share some interior, which rules out EC(x,z).

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let's try again. Let me try to build specific examples:

Example 1: PO(x,z)
- Let x be a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 1.
- Let y be a circle centered at (0.5, 0) with radius 0.5. 
- Let z be a circle centered at (0.5, 0) with radius 1.

In this case, PO(x,y) because x and y partially overlap. TPPi(y,z) because y is a tangential proper part of z. And PO(x,z) because x and z partially overlap.

Example 2: TPP(x,z)
- Let x be a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 0.5.
- Let y be a circle centered at (0.25, 0) with radius 0.25.
- Let z be a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 1.

In this case, PO(x,y) because x and y partially overlap. TPPi(y,z) because y is a tangential proper part of z. And TPP(x,z) because x is a tangential proper part of z.

Example 3: NTPP(x,z)
- Let x be a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 0.5.
- Let y be a circle centered at (0.25, 0) with radius 0.25.
- Let z be a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 2.

In this case, PO(x,y) because x and y partially overlap. TPPi(y,z) because y is a tangential proper part of z. And NTPP(x,z) because x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's check for EC(x,z):

Can I construct an example where x and z are externally connected? If EC(x,z), then x and z only touch at the boundary and don't share any interior.

But given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), x and y share some interior, and y is fully inside z. This means the shared interior of x and y is inside z, which means x and z share some interior. This contradicts EC(x,z). So, it's not possible to have EC(x,z) given the constraints.

Let's double-check if this reasoning is correct:

If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior. Let's call this shared interior region S.
If TPPi(y,z), then all of y, including S, is inside z. This means S is inside both x and z, so x and z share the interior region S.
If x and z share an interior region, they cannot be externally connected (EC) because EC requires that they don't share any interior.

So EC(x,z) is definitely not possible in the given situation.

I'm now confident that the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, actually, I'd like to re-examine EC(x,z) once more. The definition of EC is that the regions only touch at the boundary and don't share any interior. Let's carefully consider the constraints:

PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, which means they share some interior, and neither is a subset of the other.
TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, which means all of y is inside z and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, since y is inside z and x overlaps with y, the overlapping region of x and y is inside z. This means x and z share some interior, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So, EC(x,z) is not possible, and the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me formally check all possible relations once more:

DC(x,z): Not possible because x and z share some interior (as explained above).
EC(x,z): Not possible because x and z share some interior.
PO(x,z): Possible if x extends beyond z in some regions.
TPP(x,z): Possible if all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary.
NTPP(x,z): Possible if all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary.
TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z cannot be inside x given the constraints.
NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x and y partially overlap, and y is inside z, then x and z cannot be equal.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me check if I've considered all possible spatial arrangements. Let's analyze this from the perspective of 2D shapes:

Given PO(x,y), x and y share some region, but neither is contained in the other. Geometrically, they have a non-empty intersection, and there are parts of x not in y and parts of y not in x.

Given TPPi(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z. Geometrically, y is fully contained in z and touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider different possible arrangements:

Arrangement 1: y is a small circle that touches the boundary of z. x is a circle that overlaps with y.
In this case, the overlap of x and y is inside z. If x also extends outside z, then PO(x,z). If all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z). If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

Arrangement 2: y is a shape that touches the boundary of z at multiple points. x overlaps with y.
Similar to Arrangement 1, the relation between x and z can be PO, TPP, or NTPP depending on how x is positioned.

Arrangement 3: y is a shape that touches the boundary of z along a segment. x overlaps with y.
Again, the relation between x and z can be PO, TPP, or NTPP.

I don't think there are any spatial arrangements that would result in a relation other than PO, TPP, or NTPP between x and z given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, wait, let's think about DC(x,z) once more. Can x and z be disconnected? If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior. If TPPi(y,z), then all of y is inside z. This means the shared interior of x and y is inside z, which means x and z share some interior. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, and NTPP.

That's my final answer.

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what possible RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these given conditions tell us:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's work through the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, so x and z must share some points.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible because the overlap between x and y is in the interior of z, meaning x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible when x extends beyond z in some regions while their interiors overlap (through the shared region with y).

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible because z cannot be inside x (since y is inside z but not completely inside x).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible because x partially overlaps with y, but y is completely inside z.
