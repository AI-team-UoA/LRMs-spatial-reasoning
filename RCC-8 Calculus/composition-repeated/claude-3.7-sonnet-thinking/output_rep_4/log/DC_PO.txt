PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Let's analyze this situation:
- x and y are completely disconnected
- y and z partially overlap

What are the possible relationships between x and z? Let's think about this systematically.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   This is possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and z only partially overlaps with y, it's entirely possible that x and z don't share any spatial parts.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
   This is possible. x is disconnected from y, but z partially overlaps with y. It's possible that z extends beyond y in a way that it touches x at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, z could extend beyond y in a way that it partially overlaps with x.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x could be completely contained within z while touching z's boundary, and still be disconnected from y, if z is large enough to contain x in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and still be disconnected from y, if z is large enough to contain x in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. z could be completely contained within x while touching x's boundary, and still partially overlap with y, if z is positioned such that part of it overlaps with y and part of it doesn't.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. z could be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, and still partially overlap with y, if z is positioned such that part of it overlaps with y and part of it doesn't.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident
   This is not possible. If x and z were coincident, then x would have the same relationship with y as z does. But we know that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), which are different relationships.

So, all the relationships except EQ(x,z) are possible between x and z, given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, I think I need to be more careful here. Let's re-examine each possibility more rigorously:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   This is possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and z only partially overlaps with y, it's entirely possible that x and z don't share any spatial parts if z's overlap with y doesn't extend to where x is.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
   This is possible. x is disconnected from y, but z partially overlaps with y. It's possible that z extends beyond y in a way that it touches x at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, z could extend beyond y in a way that it partially overlaps with x.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x could be completely contained within z while touching z's boundary, and still be disconnected from y, if z is large enough to contain x in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. x could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and still be disconnected from y, if z is large enough to contain x in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   At first glance, this seems possible. z could be completely contained within x while touching x's boundary, and still partially overlap with y. But if TPPi(x,z), then z is entirely contained within x, which means z cannot overlap with anything that x is disconnected from. But we know PO(y,z), which means z overlaps with y. And DC(x,y) means x and y share no parts. This leads to a contradiction, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Similar to the reasoning for TPPi, if NTPPi(x,z), then z is entirely contained within x, which means z cannot overlap with anything that x is disconnected from. But we know PO(y,z), which means z overlaps with y. And DC(x,y) means x and y share no parts. This leads to a contradiction, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident
   This is not possible. If x and z were coincident, then x would have the same relationship with y as z does. But we know that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), which are different relationships.

So, the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), as I think I might have been too hasty:

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   If TPPi(x,z), then z is entirely contained within x, which means z cannot overlap with anything that x is disconnected from. But we know PO(y,z), which means z and y share some spatial part. And DC(x,y) means x and y share no spatial parts. 

   Let's break this down: If z is entirely within x, and z overlaps with y, then that overlap would have to be part of x as well. But if x and y share no parts (DC(x,y)), this is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Similar to the reasoning for TPPi, if NTPPi(x,z), then z is entirely contained within x, which means z cannot overlap with anything that x is disconnected from. But we know PO(y,z), which means z overlaps with y. And DC(x,y) means x and y share no parts. 

   Again, if z is entirely within x, and z overlaps with y, then that overlap would have to be part of x as well. But if x and y share no parts (DC(x,y)), this is a contradiction. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to reconsider my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) as well:

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   If TPP(x,z), then x is entirely contained within z. And we know DC(x,y), which means x and y share no parts. But PO(y,z) means y and z share some parts. 
   
   Now, is this scenario possible? Yes, it's possible. z could contain x in one region and overlap with y in another region, without x and y ever overlapping.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   If NTPP(x,z), then x is entirely contained within z, without touching z's boundary. And we know DC(x,y), which means x and y share no parts. But PO(y,z) means y and z share some parts.
   
   Again, this scenario is possible. z could contain x in one region and overlap with y in another region, without x and y ever overlapping.

So, the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check my reasoning for each of these:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? Yes, if z's overlap with y doesn't extend to where x is.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
   Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is it possible for x and z to touch at a boundary? Yes, if z extends beyond its overlap with y to touch x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? Yes, if z extends beyond its overlap with y to partially overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is it possible for x to be entirely contained within z while touching z's boundary? Yes, if z is large enough to contain x in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is it possible for x to be entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary? Yes, if z is large enough to contain x in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is it possible for z to be entirely contained within x while touching x's boundary? No, because if z is entirely within x, and z overlaps with y, then that overlap would have to be part of x as well. But DC(x,y) means x and y share no parts, which leads to a contradiction.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is it possible for z to be entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary? No, for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is it possible for x and z to be coincident? No, because if x and z were the same, then x would have the same relationship with y as z does, which contradicts the given relationships.

So, the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check these reasoning once more:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Imagine y and z overlap partially, and x is disconnected from y. It's quite possible that x is also disconnected from z. For instance, z might overlap with y in a region that's far away from x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
   Imagine y and z overlap partially, and x is disconnected from y. It's possible that z extends beyond its overlap with y to just touch x's boundary without sharing any interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Imagine y and z overlap partially, and x is disconnected from y. It's possible that z extends beyond its overlap with y to partially overlap with x, but neither is fully contained within the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Imagine y and z overlap partially, and x is disconnected from y. It's possible that z is large enough to entirely contain x while x touches z's boundary, without x ever overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Imagine y and z overlap partially, and x is disconnected from y. It's possible that z is large enough to entirely contain x without x touching z's boundary, without x ever overlapping with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If z is entirely contained within x, and z overlaps with y, then that overlap would have to be part of x as well. But DC(x,y) means x and y share no parts, which is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   If z is entirely contained within x, and z overlaps with y, then that overlap would have to be part of x as well. But DC(x,y) means x and y share no parts, which is a contradiction. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   If x and z were the same, then x would have the same relationship with y as z does. But we know that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), which are different relationships, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some parts but neither contains the other)

I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and z only partially overlaps with y, z can be positioned so it doesn't touch x at all.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. z can extend beyond its overlap with y to just touch x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z can extend beyond its overlap with y to partially overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. z can be large enough to completely contain x (with x touching z's boundary) while still only partially overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. z can be large enough to completely contain x (without x touching z's boundary) while still only partially overlapping with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were contained within x, and z overlaps with y, then x would have to overlap with y too, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, they would have the same relationship with y, contradicting DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
