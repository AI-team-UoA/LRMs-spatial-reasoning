PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully work through this step-by-step.

First, we're given that:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are coincident, or essentially the same region.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are essentially the same region. Therefore, any spatial relationship that y has with x, z would also have with x.

Given that TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x, and since z is equivalent to y (because EQ(y,z)), z would also be a tangential proper part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z would be TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. And EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same. So z is also a tangential proper part of x, which means TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

So the possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize there's a subtle point. Let me think about this one more time.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident, i.e., the same region.

Given these two, z would also be a tangential proper part of x. In the RCC-8 formalism, this would be written as TPP(z,x).

The inverse of TPP(z,x) is TPPi(x,z). So, from TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we can infer TPPi(x,z).

So the answer is: TPPi(x,z).

Actually wait, I'm a bit confused about the convention of these relations. Let me go back to the definitions provided.

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(x,y) means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident.

Now, if y is part of x and touches x's boundary, and z is coincident with y, then z is also part of x and touches x's boundary. This means TPP(z,x).

But the question asks for the relationship between x and z, not between z and x. 

Following the convention given, TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x). So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

So, the final answer is: TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure one more time.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(y,z): This means y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are coincident, they have the same spatial extent. Therefore, if y is a tangential proper part of x, then z is also a tangential proper part of x. This means TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Let me re-review the definitions to be totally sure:

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(y,z): This means y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are coincident, they have the same spatial extent. Therefore, if y is a tangential proper part of x, then z is also a tangential proper part of x. This means TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me translate from TPPi(x,y) to TPP(y,x) and then proceed from there.

Given:
- TPP(y,x): This means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(y,z): This means y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are coincident, they have the same spatial extent. Therefore, if y is a tangential proper part of x, then z is also a tangential proper part of x. This means TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is: TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to understand how the given relations combine.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): This means y and z are coincident (they are essentially the same region)

Since EQ(y,z), y and z have exactly the same spatial extent. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then z must also be a tangential proper part of x. 

Because y and z are coincident, any spatial relation that holds between y and another region will also hold between z and that region.

Therefore, if TPPi(x,y) holds (meaning y is a tangential proper part of x), then TPPi(x,z) must also hold (meaning z is a tangential proper part of x).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
