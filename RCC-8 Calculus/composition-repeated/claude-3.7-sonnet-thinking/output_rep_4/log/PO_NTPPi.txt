PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the information given:

1. PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap - they share some spatial parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means that y properly contains z and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to consider how these two relations constrain the possibilities.

Given PO(x,y), I know that:
- x and y share some parts
- Some parts of x are outside y
- Some parts of y are outside x

Given NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), I know that:
- z is completely inside y
- z does not touch y's boundary

Now I need to consider what these constraints imply for the relationship between x and z.

Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, there are several possibilities:

1. x and z might be disconnected (DC) - this happens if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z.
2. x and z might externally connect (EC) - this happens if x touches z at its boundary but doesn't share interior points.
3. x and z might partially overlap (PO) - this happens if x and z share some interior points, but neither contains the other.
4. x might be a tangential proper part of z (TPP) - this happens if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. x might be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP) - this happens if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. z might be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi) - this happens if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
7. z might be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi) - this happens if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. x and z might be equal (EQ) - this happens if x and z coincide.

Let me analyze each of these possibilities to see which ones are consistent with the given constraints:

1. DC(x,z): 
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can x and z be disconnected?
   We know z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y. This means x and z could be disconnected if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z. 
   This is possible, so DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can x and z externally connect?
   We know z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If x partially overlaps with y, x could touch z at its boundary.
   This is possible, so EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can x and z partially overlap?
   Since z is completely inside y and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible for x and z to share some parts while neither contains the other.
   This is possible, so PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

4. TPP(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But we know x partially overlaps with y, which means some part of x is outside y. Since z is completely inside y, it's not possible for x to be completely inside z.
   This is not possible, so TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning for TPP(x,z). Let me re-analyze:

4. TPP(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   We know z is completely inside y (NTPP(z,y)), and x partially overlaps with y. If x is completely inside z, and z is completely inside y, then x would be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y).
   Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Similar to the analysis for TPP(x,z), if x is completely inside z, and z is completely inside y, then x would be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y).
   Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   We know z is completely inside y. If z is also completely inside x and touches x's boundary, then x and y would have a more complex relationship than just PO(x,y). But this doesn't contradict the given constraints.
   This is possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to the analysis for TPPi(x,z), z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and this doesn't contradict the given constraints.
   This is possible, so NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

8. EQ(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can x and z be equal?
   If x and z are equal, and z is completely inside y, then x would also be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y).
   Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Actually, I've made another mistake in my analysis for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me re-analyze:

6. TPPi(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   We know z is completely inside y (NTPP(z,y)). We also know x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)). If z is completely inside x (TPP(z,x)), then the part of z inside y is also inside x. But PO(x,y) means that some part of x is outside y. This does not lead to a contradiction, as z can be inside the part of x that overlaps with y.
   This is possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to the analysis for TPPi(x,z), z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and this doesn't contradict the given constraints.
   This is possible, so NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Actually, I think I'm still not being clear in my analysis. Let's systematically analyze the constraints and the implications.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)).

This means:
- x and y share some parts, but some parts of x are outside y, and some parts of y are outside x.
- z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): 
   Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z. Since z is inside y but not at its boundary, and x might overlap with y in a region away from z, this is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   Can x and z externally connect? Yes, if the part of x that overlaps with y just touches z at its boundary. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if the part of x that overlaps with y also partially overlaps with z. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z):
   Can x be a tangential proper part of z? If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y. But PO(x,y) means x is not completely inside y. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Similar to TPP(x,z), if x is completely inside z, and z is completely inside y, then x would be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   Can z be a tangential proper part of x? If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and z is also completely inside y, then the part of x that contains z must overlap with y. The other parts of x might be outside y. This doesn't contradict the given constraints. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Similar to TPPi(x,z), z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and this doesn't contradict the given constraints. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
   Can x and z be equal? If x and z are equal, and z is completely inside y, then x would also be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I'm concerned about my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me try a different approach. I'll use the fact that NTPPi(y,z) means that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Since PO(x,y), there's a part of x inside y and a part outside y.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then z must be inside the part of x that's inside y (since z is completely inside y). This scenario is consistent with the given constraints.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, z must be inside the part of x that's inside y. This is also consistent.

Let me re-check the other cases as well:

For DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then the part of x that's inside y doesn't intersect with z. This is possible, but I need to make sure that this doesn't contradict the constraints.

For EC(x,z): If x and z touch at a boundary, then the part of x that's inside y touches z at its boundary. This is also possible.

For PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then part of z is inside x, and part of z is outside x. Since z is completely inside y, this means the part of x that's inside y partially overlaps with z. This is consistent.

I think my reasoning is a bit convoluted. Let me try to solve this by visualizing the scenarios more clearly.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)).

Visualization:
- y contains z completely, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.
- x shares some parts with y, has some parts outside y, and doesn't completely contain y.

Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, the possible relationships between x and z are determined by how x overlaps with y in relation to z.

1. DC(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z, then x and z are disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y touches z at its boundary but doesn't share interior points, then x and z externally connect. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y partially overlaps with z, such that part of z is inside x and part is outside x, then x and z partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But since z is completely inside y, this would imply that x is completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be completely inside z. This would also imply that x is completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of this overlapping region.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of this overlapping region.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they must coincide. But since z is completely inside y, this would imply that x is completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I need to make sure that TPPi(x,z) is actually a possible relationship given the constraints. Let's examine this further.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is completely inside y, the part of x that overlaps with y must completely contain z, and z must touch the boundary of this overlapping region.

But is this possible? If z touches the boundary of the overlapping region, and z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), then z is touching a boundary that's inside y. This boundary is the overlap between x and y. So z would touch the part of x's boundary that's inside y. This doesn't contradict the constraints, so TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

I was temporarily confused because I thought that if z touches x's boundary, and z is completely inside y, then z might also touch y's boundary. But that's not necessarily the case. The boundary of the region where x and y overlap is not the same as y's boundary. z can touch the boundary of the overlapping region without touching y's boundary.

Now I'm not sure about NTPPi(x,z) for the same reason. Let's check if NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. Given that z is completely inside y, the part of x that overlaps with y must completely contain z, and z must not touch the boundary of this overlapping region.

This is definitely possible. z can be fully inside the region where x and y overlap, without touching the boundary of this region.

Actually, I think I've been inconsistent in my reasoning. Let me reconsider TPPi(x,z) and be more precise.

For TPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x, and touches x's boundary. Given NTPPi(y,z), z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For TPPi(x,z) to be possible, the part of x's boundary that z touches must be inside y. This doesn't contradict the constraints, so TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

OK, I think I've got it now. Let me summarize:

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)).

Possible relationships between x and z:
1. DC(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z, then x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y touches z at its boundary but doesn't share interior points, then x and z externally connect.
3. PO(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y partially overlaps with z, such that part of z is inside x and part is outside x, then x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of this overlapping region, then z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of this overlapping region, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I've realized a potential issue with my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). If TPPi(x,z) holds, then z touches x's boundary, but z doesn't touch y's boundary. But the boundary of the region where x and y overlap is not just x's boundary. It includes both the part of x's boundary inside y and the part of y's boundary inside x. So if z touches x's boundary, it might touch the part of x's boundary inside y or the part of x's boundary that coincides with y's boundary.

Given that z doesn't touch y's boundary, if TPPi(x,z) holds, then z must touch the part of x's boundary that's inside y, not the part that coincides with y's boundary. This is a more specific constraint, but it's still possible, so TPPi(x,z) remains a valid possibility.

Actually, I'm still not satisfied with my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). If we have the constraints PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then we have NTPPi(y,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,y)), which means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. We also have PO(x,y), which means x and y share some parts, but neither is a proper part of the other.

For TPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, TPP(z,x)) to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. We already know z is completely inside y. So z can only touch the part of x's boundary that's inside y, not the part of x's boundary that's outside y. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, it can touch the part of x's boundary that's inside y but not touching y's boundary. This is possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Now let's check all the relations systematically.

I'll assume the constraints PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) or, equivalently, NTPP(z,y).

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z. For example, x can overlap with a part of y that doesn't contain z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y touches z at its boundary but doesn't share any interior parts. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, z touches the part of x's boundary that's inside y.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y partially overlaps with z, such that part of z is inside x and part is outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. But since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Since z is completely inside y, z can only touch the part of x's boundary that's inside y. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is fully inside the part of x that overlaps with y.

8. EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must coincide. But since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I should also consider whether TPPi(x,z) is necessarily possible given the constraints. If TPPi(x,z) holds, then z touches x's boundary, but z doesn't touch y's boundary. So the part of x's boundary that z touches must be inside y, not touching y's boundary. Is this always possible given PO(x,y)? In general, yes. But actually there are specific cases of PO(x,y) where the part of x inside y has no boundaries inside y, in which case TPPi(x,z) would not be possible. So I need to consider whether TPPi(x,z) is necessarily possible given the constraints, not just whether it's possibly possible.

Actually, let me reconsider TPPi(x,z). For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given NTPP(z,y), z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So z can touch the part of x's boundary that's inside y, but z cannot touch the part of x's boundary that coincides with y's boundary. This is possible in general, but it's not guaranteed for all cases of PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

Actually I think I'm confusing myself on TPPi(x,z). Let me try to visualize some examples to determine the constraints. Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), we have that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For TPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. There are several ways x can partially overlap with y. Let's consider the cases where TPPi(x,z) would and would not be possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must touch x's boundary from within. But since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, z must touch the part of x's boundary that's inside y but not touching y's boundary. This is not guaranteed for all configurations of x, y, and z that satisfy PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y). For example, if the part of x that's inside y forms a "bubble" with no internal boundary, then z cannot touch x's boundary while remaining inside y and not touching y's boundary.

But TPPi(x,z) is possible in other configurations. For example, if x cuts through y in a way that creates an internal boundary inside y, then z can touch that internal boundary, satisfying TPPi(x,z).

Given the constraints, TPPi(x,z) is not a guaranteed relationship, but it's a possible one, so it should be included in the list of possible relationships.

OK, let me double-check once more, to make sure I have the full set of possible relations.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)).

Possible relationships between x and z:
1. DC(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z, then x and z are disconnected. 
2. EC(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y touches z at its boundary but doesn't share interior points, then x and z externally connect. 
3. PO(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y partially overlaps with z, such that part of z is inside x and part is outside x, then x and z partially overlap. 
4. TPPi(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of this overlapping region, then z is a tangential proper part of x. 
5. NTPPi(x,z): If the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of this overlapping region, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x. 

Not possible relationships between x and z:
1. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z, but since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y).
2. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP(x,z), this would contradict PO(x,y).
3. EQ(x,z): This would also contradict PO(x,y) for the same reason.

I think the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

OK I want to think through a potential counterexample for TPPi to ensure it really is possible.

Here's an example I'm thinking about: suppose y is a circle, x is a shape that partially overlaps with y, and z is a circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary). Now the question is, can z be completely inside x and touch x's boundary?

One possible configuration is where x is a shape that extends into y and forms a "hook" inside y, such that z is completely inside this hook and touches the hook's boundary. In this case, TPPi(x,z) is satisfied along with PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

So yes, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship given the constraints.

For completeness, I should also double-check NTPPi(x,z) with a similar example.

Using the same setup with y as a circle, x is a shape that partially overlaps with y, and z is a circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary). For NTPPi(x,z), z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. One possible configuration is where x extends deeply into y, such that z is completely inside the part of x that's inside y, but not touching x's boundary. In this case, NTPPi(x,z) is satisfied along with PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

So I'm confident that NTPPi(x,z) is also a possible relationship given the constraints.

Actually, let me try to analyze if EC(x,z) is necessarily possible given the constraints. The issue is that for EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at the boundary but not share any interior points. But given that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, the boundary of z that x touches must be inside y. Is it possible for x to touch z's boundary without sharing any interior points with z, given that x partially overlaps with y? Yes, if the part of x that overlaps with y just touches z at its boundary. This is possible, so EC(x,z) is a valid possible relationship.

OK, let me double check all the relations by going through examples and counter examples.

For DC(x,z), I need to show that there is a scenario where x and z are disconnected, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
- Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that partially overlaps with y on the opposite side from z. In this case, x and z don't share any points, so DC(x,z) is satisfied. Thus, DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

For EC(x,z), I need to show that there is a scenario where x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
- Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that extends into y just enough to touch z at its boundary. In this case, x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points, so EC(x,z) is satisfied. Thus, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

For PO(x,z), I need to show that there is a scenario where x and z partially overlap, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
- Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that extends into y and overlaps partially with z. In this case, x and z share some parts, but neither is a proper part of the other, so PO(x,z) is satisfied. Thus, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

For TPPi(x,z), I need to show that there is a scenario where z is a tangential proper part of x, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
- Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that extends into y in a way that completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of the part of x that's inside y. In this case, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) is satisfied. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

For NTPPi(x,z), I need to show that there is a scenario where z is a non-tangential proper part of x, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
- Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that extends deeply into y in a way that completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of the part of x that's inside y. In this case, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,z) is satisfied. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Now, I need to show that TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible relationships given the constraints.

For TPP(x,z), I need to show that it's not possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
- If TPP(x,z) were true, then x would be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which requires that part of x is outside y. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

For NTPP(x,z), I need to show that it's not possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
- Similar to TPP(x,z), if NTPP(x,z) were true, then x would be completely inside z. Since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(x,y). Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

For EQ(x,z), I need to show that it's not possible for x and z to be equal, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).
- If EQ(x,z) were true, then x and z would coincide. Since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(x,y). Thus, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

The not possible relationships are:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

I believe my final answer is correct. The possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between regions x and z given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some parts, but neither is contained in the other)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't contain z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x extends into y just enough to touch z's boundary without overlapping z's interior.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x extends into y and partially overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): This would require x to be completely inside z. Since z is completely inside y, this would make x completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this would make x completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible if x extends into y in a way that completely contains z, with z touching x's boundary from within.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if x extends into y and completely contains z without z touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This would make x identical to z, which would mean x is completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y).
