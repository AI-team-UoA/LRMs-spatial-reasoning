PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

We're given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to figure out the possible relations between x and z.

Let's consider the possible relations one by one:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
Given that x is part of y and z is part of y, it's possible that x and z are separate regions within y. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it doesn't touch y's boundary. And since x touches y's boundary, it seems like x and z might not touch at a boundary. But wait, this isn't necessarily true. Even though z doesn't touch y's boundary, it's possible for z to touch x's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
This is a possibility. Since both x and z are parts of y, they might overlap in some region.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
This seems unlikely. For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to touch z's boundary. But z is entirely contained within y, away from y's boundary. So, x would need to be tangential to z but also tangential to y. 

Let's think more about this. 

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary.

Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Given that x touches y's boundary and z is entirely within y (not touching y's boundary), it's possible that x is partially outside z and partially inside z, with the part of x that's outside z touching y's boundary. In such a case, if x also touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) could hold.

But wait, for TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would need to be inside z, which means x couldn't touch y's boundary. This contradicts TPP(x,y).

So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
Similar to the reasoning above, for NTPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would need to be inside z. Given that x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, this contradicts TPP(x,y).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
Given NTPPi(y,z), z is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches x's boundary. Since x is a tangential proper part of y, x touches y's boundary. It's possible for z to be entirely within x, touching x's boundary, and for x to touch y's boundary.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
Similarly, it's possible for z to be entirely within x, not touching x's boundary, and for x to touch y's boundary.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident.
If x and z are the same, then x would be tangential to y (from TPP(x,y)) and non-tangential to y (from z not touching y's boundary in NTPPi(y,z)). This is a contradiction.

So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double-check my reasoning for these:

Actually I see a flaw in my reasoning above regarding TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). I made an error when I stated that for TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would need to be inside z. That's the definition of "proper part", but I also need to consider the "tangential" part of TPP.

Let's reconsider:

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be a proper part of z and x would need to touch z's boundary. 

Given that x is a proper part of y and z is a proper part of y, it's possible for x to be a proper part of z. However, for x to be tangential to z and tangential to y, x would need to touch both z's boundary and y's boundary. If x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)) and z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), it's difficult to see how x could be entirely within z and still touch y's boundary.

Wait actually, I made a mistake. TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. So z is the larger region, y is inside z (without touching z's boundary), and x is inside y (touching y's boundary).

In this case, it seems like x could be a proper part of z. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is inside z. Also, x doesn't necessarily touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) seems possible.

Let's start over. For clarity, I'll use containment relations to describe these:

TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, but z doesn't touch y's boundary. Equivalently, z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Hmm, looking at NTPPi(y,z). Since NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(z,y), it means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the position of x. From TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. Since y is inside z and away from z's boundary, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary, x is inside z. x might or might not touch z's boundary, depending on the exact configuration.

Let's go through the relations again:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
If x is inside y and y is inside z, then x is inside z. So, x and z are not disconnected.

So, DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
If x is inside y and y is inside z, then x is inside z. Therefore, they share an interior, and EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z should share some parts, and there should be parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x.

Given that x is inside y (from TPP(x,y)) and y is inside z (from NTPPi(y,z)), x is entirely inside z. There's no part of x that's not in z.

So, PO(x,z) is not a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
Given that x is inside y and y is inside z, x is inside z. If x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) would hold.

Is it possible for x to touch z's boundary? Given NTPPi(y,z), y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. And from TPP(x,y), x touches y's boundary. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, even if x touches y's boundary, x still might not touch z's boundary.

Hmm, wait. Let's be more careful. NTPPi(y,z) means y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary. So, z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

If z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary, then x and z might be disjoint or might overlap, depending on the exact configuration.

No, I've made a mistake again in understanding NTPPi. Let me clarify what each of these means:

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely contained within y, and x touches y's boundary.

NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely contained within y, and x does not touch y's boundary.

TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP(y,x). It means y is a tangential proper part of x.

NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y). It means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. 

So, to translate our conditions:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Ok, now I'm on a firmer understanding. NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

Given:
- x is a tangential proper part of y (from TPP(x,y)).
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y (from NTPPi(y,z)).

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
It's possible that x and z are separate regions within y, with no common points. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
It's possible that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
It's possible that x and z have a common region, but neither is completely contained in the other. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
For this to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, x would need to be entirely inside z and also touch both z's boundary and y's boundary. But this doesn't seem possible because if x touches y's boundary, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x can't be entirely contained in z.

So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Wait, I misunderstood. For TPP(x,z) to hold, x must be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. It doesn't have to touch y's boundary from inside z. Let's reconsider.

TPP(x,y) means x is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Can x be entirely inside z? If z is entirely inside y and x is entirely inside y, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z, depending on the exact configuration.

Can x touch z's boundary if it's entirely inside z? Yes, it's possible.

So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
For this to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. This is possible depending on the exact configuration.

So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
For this to be true, z would need to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is entirely inside y and x is entirely inside y, it's possible for z to be entirely inside x, depending on the exact configuration. And if z touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) would hold.

But there's a contradiction here. If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then z would touch y's boundary (by transitivity). This contradicts NTPPi(y,z), which states that z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Actually, that's not correct. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, it doesn't necessarily mean z touches y's boundary. It's possible for x to touch y's boundary at a different point than where z touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
For this to be true, z would need to be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. This is possible depending on the exact configuration.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident.
For this to be true, x and z should be the same region. If x and z are the same, then from TPP(x,y), x touches y's boundary. But from NTPPi(y,z), z doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction.

So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Wait, before I finalize, let me check if any of my reasoning above is flawed.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), I need to be careful. These would imply that z is a part of x. But given NTPPi(y,z), z is already a part of y. And given TPP(x,y), x is a part of y.

It's possible for z to be a part of x, which in turn is a part of y, if x and z are the same (i.e., EQ(x,z)). But if they're not the same, can z be a part of x while x is a part of y?

Let's consider the constraints: x is tangential to y and z is non-tangential to y. If z is a part of x, and x touches y's boundary, would z also touch y's boundary? Not necessarily. It's possible for x to touch y's boundary at a point where z doesn't, especially if z is a proper part of x.

So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) can be possibilities.

But let's check again if they are consistent with the given constraints:

TPP(x,y) means x is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z would need to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. If z is entirely inside x and x is entirely inside y, then z is entirely inside y. This is consistent with NTPPi(y,z). But if z touches x's boundary and x touches y's boundary, there's a concern that z might touch y's boundary, which would contradict NTPPi(y,z).

However, this doesn't have to be the case. The fact that z touches x's boundary and x touches y's boundary doesn't mean z touches y's boundary. It depends on the exact configuration. It's possible for z to touch x's boundary at a point where x doesn't touch y's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z would need to be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. If z is entirely inside x and x is entirely inside y, then z is entirely inside y. This is consistent with NTPPi(y,z). And if z doesn't touch x's boundary, it certainly won't touch y's boundary, which is also consistent with NTPPi(y,z).

So, both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are consistent with the given constraints.

Let me reconsider the case of TPP(x,z). For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. But if x is entirely inside z and z is entirely inside y (from NTPPi(y,z)), then x is entirely inside y. That's consistent with TPP(x,y). 

The issue arises when we consider the tangential aspect. If x touches z's boundary and z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, can x still touch y's boundary (to satisfy TPP(x,y))? This seems geometrically impossible. If x is entirely inside z, z is entirely inside y, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x can't touch y's boundary. This contradicts TPP(x,y).

So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let's apply the same logic to NTPP(x,z). For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. But as with TPP(x,z), if x is entirely inside z and z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then x is entirely inside y and can't touch y's boundary. This contradicts TPP(x,y).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Ok, this has proven tricky, so I want to check once more, making sure I'm not making any logical errors.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely contained within y, and x touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is entirely contained within y, and z does not touch y's boundary.

I'll visualize each possible relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with the given constraints.

First of all, let me clarify what I mean by containment. Let's say that I have two regions, A and B, and B is fully contained in A, meaning every point of B is also a point of A. Then, the boundary of B might touch the boundary of A, or it might not. If the boundary of B does touch the boundary of A, then B is a tangential proper part of A (TPP(B,A)). If the boundary of B does not touch the boundary of A, then B is a non-tangential proper part of A (NTPP(B,A)).

Here's what we know:
- x is fully contained in y, and x's boundary touches y's boundary (TPP(x,y)).
- z is fully contained in y, and z's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPPi(y,z)).

Now, I can think of the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. They don't share any points. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. There are parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z, and x's boundary touches z's boundary. If x is fully contained in z, and z is fully contained in y, then x is fully contained in y. But if x's boundary touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), and z's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), then x can't be fully contained in z. 

Actually let me think about this more careful. Let's say z is a circle strictly inside y, and x is a small circle entirely inside of z, except for a single "tendril" or "tentacle" that extends out from x to touch the boundary of y. Here, x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), and z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z)). Can x be a tangential proper part of z? No, because x extends beyond z to touch y's boundary, so x is not fully contained in z.

So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z, and x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to the case of TPP(x,z), if x is fully contained in z, and x's boundary touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), and z's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), then there's a contradiction. We know that if x is fully contained in z, it can't touch a part of y's boundary that z doesn't touch, since z is also fully inside y.

So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x, and z's boundary touches x's boundary. If z is fully contained in x, and x is fully contained in y, then z is fully contained in y. This is consistent with NTPPi(y,z). 

But if z's boundary touches x's boundary, and x's boundary touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), would z's boundary touch y's boundary? Not necessarily. Imagine z is a circle inside x, and x is a circle inside y. The boundary of z touches the boundary of x at a point, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y at a different point. In this case, the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

Actually, let me double check TPPi(x,z). This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, so z's boundary touches x's boundary. Now, we are given that z doesn't touch y's boundary and x touches y's boundary. Let's imagine a diagram where z is inside x, z touches x's boundary, x touches y's boundary, but z doesn't touch y's boundary. 

Picture x and y as circles, with x inside y and touching y's boundary at a single point. Now, z is a circle inside x, and z touches x's boundary at a single point. If this point where z touches x's boundary is different from the point where x touches y's boundary, then z doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a consistent diagram.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is fully contained in x, and x is fully contained in y, then z is fully contained in y. This is consistent with NTPPi(y,z). And if z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary, it certainly won't touch y's boundary, which is also consistent with NTPPi(y,z).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then from TPP(x,y), x touches y's boundary. But from NTPPi(y,z), z doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction.

So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let's summarize the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z):
1. DC(x,z): Possible
2. EC(x,z): Possible
3. PO(x,z): Possible
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible

Actually, let me double check my argument for why TPP(x,z) is not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), then x is fully contained in z and x's boundary touches z's boundary. If z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z)), then z is fully contained in y and z's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary. 

If x is fully contained in z, and z is fully contained in y, then x is fully contained in y. And since x's boundary touches z's boundary (from TPP(x,z)), and z's boundary is strictly inside y's boundary, this means x's boundary is also strictly inside y's boundary. So x's boundary cannot touch y's boundary, which contradicts TPP(x,y).

I think I've been correct in ruling out TPP(x,z).

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)), then x is fully contained in z and x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary. If z is fully contained in y and z's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary, then x is fully contained in y and x's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary. This contradicts TPP(x,y), which says x's boundary touches y's boundary.

So, TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are correctly ruled out.

For TPPi(x,z), this means z is a tangential proper part of x. So, z is fully contained in x and z's boundary touches x's boundary. If x is a tangential proper part of y, then x is fully contained in y and x's boundary touches y's boundary. 

The constraint that z's boundary touches x's boundary doesn't mean z's boundary touches y's boundary. It depends on the specific points where the boundaries touch. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), this means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So, z is fully contained in x and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with the given constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z)

Let me think about them once more.

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap. This is possible.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. There are parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x. This is possible.

TPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x, and z's boundary touches x's boundary. This is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible.

TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible given the constraints.

Actually, there's something I want to check.

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap. If x touches z at their boundaries, and x also touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), and z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), are there any constraints that might be violated?

EC(x,z) means x and z share one or more boundary points, but their interiors don't overlap. For this to be consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we need to ensure that the boundary points where x and z touch are not the same as the boundary points where x touches y.

Let's imagine y as a circle. x is inside y and touches y's boundary at a point. z is also inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary. Can x and z touch at their boundaries without violating these constraints? Yes, they can. The point where x and z touch is inside y, and it's different from the point where x touches y.

So, EC(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

For the other relations, I'm confident in my reasoning.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double check NTPPi(x,z). This means z is fully contained in x, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. In other words, there's a buffer region inside x, surrounding z. 

We're given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z)), so z is fully contained in y and z's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary.

Also, x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), so x is fully contained in y and x's boundary touches y's boundary.

If z is fully contained in x, and x is fully contained in y, then z is fully contained in y. That's consistent. 

If z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary, and x's boundary touches y's boundary, then z's boundary certainly doesn't touch y's boundary. That's also consistent.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

Now, let's check TPPi(x,z). This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is fully contained in x and z's boundary touches x's boundary.

If z is fully contained in x, and x is fully contained in y, then z is fully contained in y. That's consistent with NTPPi(y,z).

If z's boundary touches x's boundary, does that mean z's boundary touches y's boundary? Not necessarily. It depends on the specific points where the boundaries touch. If z touches x's boundary at a point, and x touches y's boundary at a different point, then z doesn't touch y's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(y,z).

So, TPPi(x,z) is also a possibility.

For PO(x,z), this means x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. Can this be consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z)?

If x and z are both fully contained in y, can they overlap without either being fully contained in the other? Yes, they can.

But can x touch y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)) and z not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)) if they partially overlap? Yes, the part of x that touches y's boundary can be separate from the part where x and z overlap.

So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

OK, I'm confident in my final answer: the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me break down what we know:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary)

Let's analyze each possible relationship:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Both x and z are inside y, but they can be completely separate regions.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can partially overlap within y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x couldn't touch y's boundary (contradicting TPP(x,y)).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Similar to TPP(x,z), if x were completely inside z, it couldn't touch y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, while x touches y's boundary at a different point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, x would both touch and not touch y's boundary, which is contradictory.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
