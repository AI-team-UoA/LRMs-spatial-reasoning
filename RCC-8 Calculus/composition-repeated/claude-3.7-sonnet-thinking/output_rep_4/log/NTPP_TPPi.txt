PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider each of these relations carefully:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is contained entirely within y (it's a proper part of y) and doesn't touch y's boundary at all.

2. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. This is the inverse of TPP, so it means that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained entirely within y (it's a proper part of y) and touches y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints. Since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)) and z is completely inside y (TPP(z,y), which is the same as TPPi(y,z)), both x and z are inside y. But I need to determine how x and z relate to each other.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z don't overlap or touch within y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some spatial part but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (because NTPP(x,y)), and z does touch y's boundary (because TPP(z,y)), if x touches z's boundary, it would be at a part of z's boundary that's internal to y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z and z surrounds x without x touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained entirely within x and touches x's boundary. But we know that z touches y's boundary (because TPP(z,y)), and x doesn't touch y's boundary (because NTPP(x,y)). So z would touch a boundary of y that x doesn't touch, which contradicts z being fully contained in x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But again, we know that z touches y's boundary, which would mean that x would also have to touch y's boundary at that point, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means they occupy the same space. But we know that z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, so they can't be equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I've made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider. The relation TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which is the same as TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is contained entirely within y and touches y's boundary.

Actually, let me just restate everything to avoid confusion:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is contained completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z contains y completely and y touches z's boundary.

Since y touches z's boundary, and y contains x completely, we can see that x is contained completely inside z. But does x touch z's boundary? If x touched z's boundary, it would have to be at a point where z's boundary passes through the interior of y (since x doesn't touch y's boundary, which is part of z's boundary). 

Actually, let me draw out a clear example. I think the issue is that I've been inadvertently flipping y and z.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. This is the inverse of TPP(y,z), so it means TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is contained entirely within y and touches y's boundary.

So the situation is:
- x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given this, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z don't overlap or touch within y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some spatial part but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained entirely within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z contains x and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z and z surrounds x without x touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained entirely within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if x contains z and z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means they occupy the same space. This is possible if x and z coincide.

Actually, I think I'm still making a conceptual error. Let me once more carefully define TPPi(y,z):

TPPi(y,z) means the inverse of TPP(y,z). So it means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Hmm, wait. Let me be really clear about TPPi. 

TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b. So a is a proper part of b and a touches b's boundary.

TPPi(a,b) is the inverse, so it means that b is a tangential proper part of a. So b is a proper part of a and b touches a's boundary. 

So TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary.

That makes sense with the knowledge given, where NTPP(x,y) means x is completely contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and TPPi(y,z) means z is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary. So both x and z are contained in y, with x not touching y's boundary and z touching y's boundary.

Given this setup, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z don't overlap or touch within y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some spatial part but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained entirely within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z contains x and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z and z surrounds x without x touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained entirely within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if x contains z and z touches x's boundary. But wait, z touches y's boundary (since TPPi(y,z)), and x doesn't touch y's boundary (since NTPP(x,y)). If z is contained entirely within x, then how can z touch y's boundary when x doesn't? This is a contradiction, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But z touches y's boundary, and if z is contained entirely within x, then x would also touch y's boundary at that point. But NTPP(x,y) tells us that x doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means they occupy the same space. But z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, so they can't be equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Oh, actually I'm still making an error. TPPi is confusing me a bit, so let me first look at the definition once more:

TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b). It means that b is a tangential proper part of a. So b is completely contained in a and touches a's boundary.

So TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, no, that's wrong. If TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b, then TPPi(a,b), the inverse, means b is a tangential proper part of a. But that's equivalent to TPP(b,a).

So TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

But I think I've been misunderstanding 'inverse' here. The 'i' in TPPi doesn't just mean we invert the relation, it means we invert the arguments. So TPPi(a,b) actually means TPP(b,a).

So TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

I think I've been making the same conclusion each time, but getting confused along the way. So, to reiterate:

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, given these constraints, I'll reconsider the possible relationships between x and z. Since they are both inside y, with x not touching y's boundary and z touching y's boundary, let's analyze their possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect (they touch at their boundaries but their interiors are disconnected). This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some spatial part but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because z touches y's boundary, which x doesn't touch. If z were inside x, then x would also touch y's boundary at the points where z does, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is not possible because z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, so they can't be equal.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually, I'm not sure if all of these are possible given the constraints. Let me think...

Let's check if TPP(x,z) is truly possible. TPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary. So if x touches z's boundary, it would have to be a part of z's boundary that's not part of y's boundary, i.e., an internal boundary. This is possible.

Now, let's check if DC(x,z) is truly possible. DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. Both x and z are inside y. z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y.

Let's check if EC(x,z) is truly possible. EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Both x and z are inside y. z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

Let's check if PO(x,z) is truly possible. PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. Both x and z are inside y. z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't. This is possible if x and z share some spatial part but neither is fully contained in the other.

Let's check if NTPP(x,z) is truly possible. NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Both x and z are inside y. z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't. This is possible if x is deep inside z, away from both z's boundary and y's boundary.

So it seems like all five of these relationships (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP) are possible given the constraints.

Actually, let's double-check my earlier reasoning about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. We know z touches y's boundary. If z were inside x, then at the points where z touches y's boundary, x would also touch y's boundary. But NTPP(x,y) tells us that x doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We know z touches y's boundary. If z were inside x, then at the points where z touches y's boundary, x would also touch y's boundary. But NTPP(x,y) tells us that x doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So my previous reasoning is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, I think I've been making a serious error in my reasoning about TPPi(y,z). Let me go back to the definitions and make sure I'm understanding them correctly.

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. This means a is a proper part of b (i.e., a is completely contained in b) and a touches b's boundary.

TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b). It means b is a tangential proper part of a. So TPPi(a,b) is equivalent to TPP(b,a).

So TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y... wait, I think that's wrong. It should mean y is a tangential proper part of z.

TPPi(y,z) means the inverse of TPP(y,z). The inverse of "y is a tangential proper part of z" is "z is a tangential proper part of y", which is TPP(z,y). But no, that's not right either. The inverse of TPP(y,z) would be switching the role of y and z, so it would be TPP(z,y).

OK, "tangential proper part inverse" means the inverse of the "tangential proper part" relation. If TPP(a,b) means "a is a tangential proper part of b", then TPPi(a,b) means "a is a tangential proper part inverse of b", which means "b is a tangential proper part of a".

So TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary.

OK, so I've been correct all along:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

So both x and z are inside y, with x not touching y's boundary and z touching y's boundary.

Given these constraints, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect (touch at their boundaries but don't overlap).
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible due to the constraints given.

Let me actually draw a picture to make sure the relations I've included are all possible. If we have y as a large region, and within y we have x not touching y's boundary and z touching y's boundary, then:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not touching each other.
2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.
3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z share some spatial part but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

I have no reason to think any of the additional constraint eliminate any of these options, so I believe all five are possible.

Let me actually apply the transitivity table for the RCC-8 calculus to double-check.

From NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

According to the transitivity table, the composition of NTPP and TPPi gives:
NTPP · TPPi = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}

This agrees with my reasoning above. The possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just double-check by thinking about it. The tangential proper part inverse relation, TPPi(y,z), states that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. So z contains y, and y touches z's boundary. Combined with the fact that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, we can derive that x is inside z (since y is inside z). 

But the relationship between x and z could vary. x could be disconnected from other parts of z (outside of y), it could touch those parts at a boundary, it could partially overlap with them, it could be a tangential proper part of z (touching z's boundary at points that are interior to y), or it could be a non-tangential proper part of z.

So the possible relationships are indeed DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm once again confused about how to apply the TPPi relation. Let me be extra careful:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. So a is inside b and touches b's boundary.
TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. So b is inside a and touches a's boundary.

So TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Combined with NTPP(x,y), which means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, I need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

Since both x and z are inside y, with x not touching y's boundary and z touching y's boundary, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z). The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

Hmm, let me check the constraints again to make sure this is true. I previously argued that TPPi(x,z) would lead to a contradiction because TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x, but z touches y's boundary which x doesn't touch, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible. Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z would have to be inside x, leading to the same contradiction, and EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same, but they have different relationships with y's boundary.

But let me double check if the five remaining relationships are possible.

DC(x,z): This is possible. Both x and z are inside y, with x away from y's boundary and z touching y's boundary. If x and z are separate regions within y, not touching each other, then DC(x,z) holds.

EC(x,z): This is possible. Both x and z are inside y, with x away from y's boundary and z touching y's boundary. If x and z touch at their boundaries within y, then EC(x,z) holds.

PO(x,z): This is possible. Both x and z are inside y, with x away from y's boundary and z touching y's boundary. If x and z share some spatial part but neither is fully contained in the other, then PO(x,z) holds.

TPP(x,z): This is possible. Both x and z are inside y, with x away from y's boundary and z touching y's boundary. If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary (at a part of z's boundary that's interior to y), then TPP(x,z) holds.

NTPP(x,z): This is possible. Both x and z are inside y, with x away from y's boundary and z touching y's boundary. If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

So, yes, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to re-read the original constraint TPPi(y,z). 

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. So a is a proper part of b and touches b's boundary.
TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. So b is a proper part of a and touches a's boundary.

So TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y, and NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, both x and z are inside y. And from this, I already showed that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, the definition given in the context says that "TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)". So TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So I'm confident in my answer: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hang on, I think I may be mistaken about PO(x,z). Let me reconsider.

PO(a,b) means a and b partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we know that x is completely inside y (and doesn't touch y's boundary) and z is completely inside y (and touches y's boundary). Could x and z partially overlap, where neither is fully contained in the other? Yes, this seems possible. Part of x could overlap with part of z, while another part of x doesn't overlap with z, and another part of z doesn't overlap with x.

But let me consider it more carefully to make sure there are no contradictions. There are different ways x and z could partially overlap. Some part of x could be outside of z, some part of z could be outside of x, and they would share some common region. Since both x and z are inside y, and z touches y's boundary while x doesn't, part of z must be closer to y's boundary than any part of x. It seems entirely plausible that they could partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me understand what these relations mean:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP(y,z), meaning TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these constraints, both x and z are inside y, with x not touching y's boundary and z touching y's boundary.

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:
1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected within y
2. EC(x,z): x and z can externally connect (touch at boundaries)
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because:
- If z were inside x (TPPi or NTPPi), then x would have to touch y's boundary where z does, contradicting NTPP(x,y)
- x and z cannot be equal (EQ) as they have different relationships with y's boundary

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
