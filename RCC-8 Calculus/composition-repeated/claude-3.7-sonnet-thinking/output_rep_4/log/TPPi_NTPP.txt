PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We have TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.

We also have NTPP(y,z), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that y is part of z, but y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about what we know:
- y is a tangential proper part of x (touches x's boundary)
- y is a non-tangential proper part of z (doesn't touch z's boundary)

This means:
- y is completely inside x, touching x's boundary
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

Since y is inside both x and z, x and z must overlap in some way. The question is: how can they overlap?

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the part that is y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundary but don't share interior points. This is also impossible because y is part of both x and z, which means x and z share interior points (specifically, the interior points of y).

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. For example, imagine y is a small circle, x is a slightly larger circle containing y (with y touching x's boundary), and z is another circle containing y but extending in a different direction than x, so that x and z overlap but neither contains the other.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. For example, if x is contained within z and touches the boundary of z, while y is contained within x and touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. For example, if x is contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, while y is contained within x and touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. For example, if z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x, while y is contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then any part of z (including y) also cannot touch x's boundary. But we know TPPi(x,y), which means y touches the boundary of x. This creates a contradiction.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident (the same region). This is not possible. If x and z are the same, then y would have the same relationship with both, but we know TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), which are different relationships.

Let me double-check the case for NTPPi(x,z).
We have TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
We have NTPP(y,z), which means y is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
If NTPPi(x,z), then NTPP(z,x), which means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
But wait, if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then any part of z (including y) also cannot touch x's boundary. But we know TPPi(x,y), which means y touches the boundary of x. This creates a contradiction.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. If NTPPi(x,z), it means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But y is a part of z (since NTPP(y,z)), and y also touches the boundary of x (since TPPi(x,y)). Is this a contradiction?

Let's think more visually. Imagine x as a large circle, z as a medium-sized circle inside x but not touching x's boundary, and y as a small circle inside z. If y is inside z and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y also doesn't touch the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which requires y to touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Let me reconsider the case for TPPi(x,z). If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x. We know NTPP(y,z), which means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. We also know TPPi(x,y), which means y touches the boundary of x. Is this consistent?

If z touches the boundary of x at some point p, and y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y must be separated from the boundary of x by at least the "thickness" of z. So y cannot touch the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which requires y to touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is also impossible.

Let me double-check this. If TPPi(x,z), then TPP(z,x). So z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z touches the boundary of x. But we know NTPP(y,z), which means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. If y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and z touches the boundary of x, then y must be separated from the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which means y touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this again. If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. This means that z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x at some point(s). We know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. 

Now, let's consider the relationship between y and x. We know TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y touches the boundary of x. But if y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and z is inside x (even if z touches the boundary of x), then y cannot touch the boundary of x. This contradiction shows that TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Let me re-consider the case for PO(x,z). 
We have TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
We have NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If PO(x,z), then x and z partially overlap. Is this consistent with the above?

If y is contained within the overlapping region of x and z, and y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, then z must extend beyond the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. Otherwise, y would also touch the boundary of z.

But wait, this means that at the point where y touches the boundary of x, z must extend beyond x. But this contradicts the fact that y is inside z, because points outside x cannot be inside y, and thus cannot be inside z.

This is confusing. Let me try to think more clearly. We know:
- y is completely inside x, and touches the boundary of x.
- y is completely inside z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

From these, we can infer that:
- x and z must overlap (since y is inside both).
- At the points where y touches the boundary of x, z must extend beyond x. Otherwise, y would also touch the boundary of z.

But this second inference is problematic. If z extends beyond x at the points where y touches the boundary of x, then how can y be inside both x and z? 

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's try a simpler approach. 

We know:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

From the first condition, we know that y touches the boundary of x. From the second condition, we know that y doesn't touch the boundary of z. For both of these to be true, z must extend beyond x at the points where y touches the boundary of x. This means that x is not a proper part of z, and z is not a proper part of x. The only remaining possibilities are PO(x,z) or EQ(x,z). But we already ruled out EQ(x,z) earlier. So PO(x,z) is the only possibility.

Actually, let me try one more approach, which is to go through all the cases methodically and see which ones are possible.

1. DC(x,z): Impossible, because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible, because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Let's check. We know y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. For this to be true, z must extend beyond x at the points where y touches the boundary of x. This means neither x nor z is contained within the other, which is consistent with PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is contained within z and touches the boundary of z. We know y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. If x touches the boundary of z, and y touches the boundary of x, then y might also touch the boundary of z (if x touches z at the same point where y touches x). But this would contradict NTPP(y,z), which says y doesn't touch the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) seems impossible.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. If TPP(x,z), then x touches the boundary of z. But the point where x touches the boundary of z need not be the same as the point where y touches the boundary of x. So it's possible for y to touch the boundary of x without touching the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So x is contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. We know y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y definitely doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x. We know y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. If z touches the boundary of x at some point p, and y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y cannot touch the boundary of x (since it's separated from the boundary of x by at least the "thickness" of z). But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which requires y to touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. We know y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y definitely doesn't touch the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which requires y to touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident (the same region). We know y has different relationships with x and z (tangential to x but non-tangential to z), which is impossible if x and z are the same. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I made an error in my analysis of TPP(x,z). Let me rethink it. 

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is contained within z and touches the boundary of z. We know y is inside x (since TPPi(x,y)) and touches the boundary of x. If x touches the boundary of z, and y touches the boundary of x, then y might also touch the boundary of z (if x touches z at the same point where y touches x). 

Let's think more carefully. If TPP(x,z), then x touches the boundary of z at some point(s). But we know that y touches the boundary of x. Can y touch the boundary of z as well? If y touches the boundary of x at a point where x also touches the boundary of z, then y would also touch the boundary of z. But this would contradict NTPP(y,z), which says y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, for TPP(x,z) to be possible, y must touch the boundary of x at a point where x does not touch the boundary of z. Is this possible? 

Yes, it's possible. Imagine x as a circle that touches the boundary of z at one point, and y as a smaller circle inside x that touches the boundary of x at a different point. In this case, y doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me also double-check my analysis of PO(x,z).

If PO(x,z), then x and z partially overlap. We know y is inside both x and z (since TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)). So y must be in the overlapping region of x and z. We also know y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. 

For this to be true, the boundary of x that y touches must be inside z (not part of the boundary of z). Is this possible? Yes, imagine x and z as overlapping circles, with y as a smaller circle inside the overlapping region, touching the boundary of x at a point inside z. 

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me verify the PO(x,z) case once more. We know TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y touches the boundary of x. We also know NTPP(y,z), which means y doesn't touch the boundary of z. 

For PO(x,z) to be possible, y must be in the overlapping region of x and z, and y must touch the boundary of x at a point inside z. But this seems impossible, because if y touches the boundary of x, and the boundary of x is inside z, then that point is on the boundary of x and inside z, which doesn't make sense.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's be more precise. The boundary of x can be divided into two parts: the part that's inside z, and the part that's outside z. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, then y is touching the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, which is consistent with our conditions.

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me think yet again, as I'm a bit confused. The boundary of x can be divided into the part that's inside z, the part that's outside z, and the part that's on the boundary of z. If PO(x,z), then the boundary of x must intersect the boundary of z.

If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, then y is touching the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). Is this possible with PO(x,z)? Yes, because even though x and z overlap, the boundary of x can extend into the interior of z, and y can touch this part of the boundary.

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

To summarize once more, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me triple-check these cases just to make sure. Let's go through it more methodically.

We have TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is properly contained within x (y is a part of x and x is not a part of y) and y touches the boundary of x.

We also have NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is properly contained within z (y is a part of z and z is not a part of y) and y does not touch the boundary of z.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the part that is y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundary but don't share interior points. This is also impossible because y is a part of both x and z, which means x and z share interior points (specifically, the interior points of y).

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap (each contains parts the other doesn't, and they share some parts). For this to be consistent with TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we need y to be in the overlapping region, y must touch the boundary of x, and y must not touch the boundary of z. 

Is this possible? Yes, imagine two overlapping circles x and z, with a smaller circle y inside the overlapping region, touching the boundary of x at a point that's inside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is properly contained within z and x touches the boundary of z. We know y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. For this to be consistent with NTPP(y,z), y must not touch the boundary of z. This means y must touch the boundary of x at a point where x does not touch the boundary of z.

Is this possible? Yes, imagine a circle x inside a larger circle z, with x touching the boundary of z at one point, and a smaller circle y inside x, touching the boundary of x at a different point. In this case, y doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So x is properly contained within z and x does not touch the boundary of z. We know y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y definitely doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

Is this possible? Yes, imagine a circle x inside a larger circle z, with x not touching the boundary of z, and a smaller circle y inside x, touching the boundary of x. In this case, y doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is properly contained within x and z touches the boundary of x. We know y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. If z touches the boundary of x at some point p, and y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y cannot touch the boundary of x (since it's separated from the boundary of x by at least the "thickness" of z). But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which requires y to touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is properly contained within x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. We know y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y definitely doesn't touch the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which requires y to touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident (the same region). We know y has different relationships with x and z (tangential to x but non-tangential to z), which is impossible if x and z are the same. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me actually double-check the TPP(x,z) case once more, to make sure I haven't made a mistake.

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is properly contained within z and x touches the boundary of z. We know y is inside x (since TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x)) and touches the boundary of x. For this to be consistent with NTPP(y,z), y must not touch the boundary of z.

Is it possible for y to touch the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, given that x touches the boundary of z? Yes, as long as y touches the boundary of x at a point where x does not touch the boundary of z. Imagine a circle x inside a larger circle z, with x touching the boundary of z at one point, and a smaller circle y inside x, touching the boundary of x at a different point. In this case, y doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the PO(x,z) case once more time to be absolutely certain.

If PO(x,z), then x and z partially overlap. We know y is inside both x and z (since TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)). So y must be in the overlapping region of x and z. We also know y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. 

Is it possible for y to be in the overlapping region of x and z, and touch the boundary of x but not the boundary of z? The boundary of x can be divided into the part that's inside z, the part that's outside z, and the part that's on the boundary of z. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, then y is touching the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be 100% certain about the PO(x,z) case. I need to check that y can touch the boundary of x at a point that's inside z. 

The boundary of x consists of points that are in x but any neighborhood of such a point contains points that are not in x. Similarly, a point is inside z if it's in z and all points in some small neighborhood of it are also in z.

Now, can a point be both on the boundary of x and inside z? Yes, because being on the boundary of x means that any neighborhood contains points not in x, but this doesn't prevent the point and its neighborhood from being inside z.

So it's possible for y to touch the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, which means PO(x,z) is possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me check once more to make sure all three cases really work:

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. y is inside both x and z. y touches the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, so y is touching the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. This is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. y is inside x. y touches the boundary of x at a point where x does not touch the boundary of z, so y is touching the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. This is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. y is inside x. y touches the boundary of x, but since x doesn't touch the boundary of z, y doesn't touch the boundary of z either. This is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check the case of NTPP(x,z).

If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So x is properly contained within z and x does not touch the boundary of z. We know y is inside x (since TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x)) and touches the boundary of x. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y definitely doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

Is this possible? Yes, imagine a circle x inside a larger circle z, with x not touching the boundary of z, and a smaller circle y inside x, touching the boundary of x. In this case, y doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Just to be extra sure, let me check all of the cases again:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because y is a part of both x and z.
2. EC(x,z): Impossible because y is a part of both x and z, which means x and z share interior points.
3. PO(x,z): Possible as long as y is in the overlapping region of x and z, and y touches the boundary of x at a point that's inside z.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible as long as y touches the boundary of x at a point where x does not touch the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible as long as y touches the boundary of x.
6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible because if z is a tangential proper part of x, and y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y cannot touch the boundary of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y).
7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible because if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y is inside z, then y cannot touch the boundary of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y).
8. EQ(x,z): Impossible because y has different relationships with x and z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Final answer: The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me understand what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary

Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y in the overlapping region. y can touch x's boundary at a point that's inside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z, with y touching x's boundary at a point where x doesn't touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while y touches x's boundary (which is still fully inside z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z were a tangential proper part of x, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, then y couldn't touch x's boundary (contradicting TPPi(x,y)).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (which is inside z) couldn't touch x's boundary (contradicting TPPi(x,y)).

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. y can't have different relationships with x and z if they're the same region.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
