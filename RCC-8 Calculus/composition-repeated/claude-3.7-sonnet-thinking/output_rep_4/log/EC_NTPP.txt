PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. 

We know that:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. This means they touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let's consider each of the eight RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part
6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal

Since y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y but doesn't overlap with y (EC(x,y)), x must have some relationship with z. Let's analyze each possibility:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is not possible. Since y is completely inside z and x touches y, x must have some connection with z as well.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is possible. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could touch z exactly at z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible. x could partially overlap with z while still being externally connected to y.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is possible. x could be completely inside z but touching z's boundary, while still being externally connected to y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, it cannot be externally connected to y which is also completely inside z.

Hmm, let me re-evaluate that. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), then x touches y at y's boundary. Since y is completely inside z, x must extend at least to y's boundary. So x could potentially be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Let me reconsider.

Actually, x could be non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)) if it's completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y at y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is completely inside z, and x only touches y at y's boundary, it's not possible for z to be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Similarly, z cannot be completely inside x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This is not possible. If x and z are equal, then y would be completely inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me double check my analysis:

- DC(x,z): Not possible because x must have some connection with z.
- EC(x,z): Possible. x could touch z exactly at z's boundary.
- PO(x,z): Possible. x could partially overlap with z.
- TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z but touching z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y at y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible. z cannot be inside x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. z cannot be inside x.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible. x and z cannot be equal.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my analysis of NTPP(x,z). Let me reconsider this case.

If NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
If EC(x,y), then x touches y at y's boundary.

If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(x,z)), and x touches y at y's boundary, then both x and y are completely inside z, and they touch each other. This scenario is actually consistent with the given constraints. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me visualize a scenario:
- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary
- x is another smaller circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching y at y's boundary

This scenario satisfies EC(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually let me be a bit more careful in my analysis. Let's go through all eight relations again:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z share no points. However, we know that y is completely inside z, and x touches y. So x must have some spatial relation with z, and thus they cannot be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior points. This is possible if x touches z exactly at z's boundary. For instance, if z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is outside z but touches both y and z at their boundaries.

Wait, but if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x cannot touch z's boundary without overlapping with z. Let me reconsider.

Actually, EC(x,z) is not possible. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y (EC(x,y)), then x must overlap with z to some extent.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. If y is completely inside z, and x partially overlaps with z while touching y at y's boundary, this satisfies all constraints.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary while also touching y at y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. As I analyzed earlier, this is possible. Both x and y could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching each other.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is completely inside z, if z is inside x, then y is also inside x. But this contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Similarly, z cannot be completely inside x because y is inside z and would also be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Let me double-check these conclusions with some examples:

PO(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle that partially overlaps with z and touches y at y's boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and PO(x,z).

TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle completely inside z, touching z's boundary, and also touching y at y's boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

NTPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as another smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), touching y at y's boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I previously said that EC(x,z) is possible, but upon further analysis, I realized it's not possible. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, then x cannot touch z's boundary without overlapping with z.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Hmm, let me try one more time on EC(x,z) to be certain.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, could x also touch z at z's boundary without overlapping with z?

Let's think about this geometrically. Since y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, there's some distance between y and z's boundary. If x touches y at y's boundary, then x has to extend from y's boundary. To touch z at z's boundary, x would have to extend from y all the way to z's boundary. But this means x would have to cross the space between y and z, which implies x overlaps with z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Actually, let me be even more careful. I want to make sure I'm not overlooking any possibilities or making any errors in my analysis.

We know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

We want to find all possible relations between x and z.

Let's try to reason through this more systematically.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: For x and z to be disconnected, they would have to share no points. However, since y is completely inside z and x touches y, x must have some spatial relation with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: For x and z to be externally connected, they would have to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. Let me think more carefully about this.

   Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), there's some distance between y and z's boundary. If x touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then any part of x that extends outward from y would either be:
   
   a. Completely inside z, in which case x and z would share interior parts (contradicting EC(x,z)), or
   
   b. Extend all the way to z's boundary and beyond, in which case x and z would also share interior parts (contradicting EC(x,z)).
   
   Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share some interior parts, but neither should be contained in the other.

   Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x must extend to y's boundary. If x extends beyond y in a way that it's not completely contained in z, then x and z would partially overlap. This scenario is consistent with the given constraints. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

   Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x could be designed to be completely inside z and also touch z's boundary. This scenario is consistent with the given constraints. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

   Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x could be designed to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This scenario is consistent with the given constraints. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

   Given that y is completely inside z, if z is inside x, then y would also be inside x. But this contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

   Similar to the previous case, if z is inside x, then y would also be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: For x and z to be equal, they would need to be coincident.

   If x and z are the same, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check the analysis of EC(x,z) one more time, as I think this is the most subtle case:

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)), x would have to extend from y's boundary. Since y is not touching z's boundary, any part of x that extends outward from y would either be completely inside z (in which case x and z would share interior parts, contradicting EC(x,z)), or extend all the way to z's boundary and beyond (in which case x and z would also share interior parts, contradicting EC(x,z)). Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Hmm, the more I think about this, I'm now questioning my analysis of PO(x,z). Let me check it again.

PO(x,z) would mean that x and z share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other. Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x must extend to y's boundary. If x extends beyond y in a way that it's not completely contained in z, then x and z would partially overlap.

But wait, given that y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y at y's boundary, any part of x that extends outward from y would either be inside z or extend all the way to z's boundary and beyond. If x extends beyond z's boundary, then it would partially overlap with z. But if x is completely inside z, then it wouldn't be a partial overlap but rather a proper part of z.

Let me visualize a scenario where PO(x,z) holds:
- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary
- x is another shape that touches y at y's boundary and extends both inside z and outside z, making it partially overlap with z.

This seems consistent with the given constraints. So PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Let me double-check whether I've made any errors in my analysis. I've gone through all eight relations and determined which ones are possible given the constraints EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). I believe my analysis is correct.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Actually, let me just make one more check, for EC(x,z). I'd like to describe a situation where EC(x,z) holds.

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)), x would have to extend from y's boundary.

Oh wait, I think I might have a way to satisfy EC(x,z). Imagine z as a hollow donut shape (a torus), and y is a solid circle inside the hole of the donut, not touching the donut. Then x could be a larger hollow donut that surrounds y and touches it at y's boundary, and x also touches z at z's outer boundary. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts, satisfying EC(x,z).

Let me think about whether this scenario truly satisfies all the constraints.

NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. In the scenario I just described, y is not inside z, but rather inside the hole of z. This doesn't satisfy NTPP(y,z). So this scenario doesn't work.

Actually, I think the issue is that I may be misinterpreting the definition of NTPP. Let me revisit the definition: NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

So y must be part of z, meaning y is inside z. And y doesn't touch z's boundary. This confirms my earlier understanding.

Given these definitions, if y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x would have to extend from y's boundary. Since y is completely inside z and not touching z's boundary, any part of x that extends outward from y would either:
- Stay completely inside z, in which case x would be a proper part of z (either TPP or NTPP), or
- Extend all the way through z and beyond, in which case x would partially overlap with z.

There doesn't seem to be a way for x to touch z at z's boundary without sharing any interior parts with z, given the constraints. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So I maintain that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Ah, I just realized something. I've been assuming that the regions are simple and connected. But that might not be a valid assumption. For instance, x could be a disconnected region, with one part touching y and another part touching z's boundary, but with no part of x being inside z. This would satisfy EC(x,z).

Let me think about this more carefully. Actually, I think RCC-8 does assume that regions are simple and connected. Let me re-read the definitions:

- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

There's no explicit mention that regions must be connected. But let's take a step back: regions in RCC-8 are supposed to be regular closed sets. Topologically, this does not require regions to be connected. So it's possible for regions to have multiple disconnected parts.

Given this, let me reconsider the EC(x,z) case. If x is a disconnected region with one part touching y and another part touching z's boundary, but with no part of x being inside z, would this satisfy EC(x,z)?

Actually, I think there's an issue with this scenario. If x has a part that touches y, and y is completely inside z, then that part of x must have some spatial relation with z as well. If that part of x doesn't overlap with z, it means it's just a single point, which doesn't make sense in a regular closed set. So this scenario doesn't work.

But wait, let me try another scenario. What if x is a "C" shape that wraps around z from the outside, touching z at z's boundary, and x also has a tiny "arm" that extends inside z to touch y at y's boundary? In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary, but they wouldn't share any interior parts. This would satisfy EC(x,z).

But there's an issue with this scenario too. If x has a part that extends inside z to touch y, then x and z would share some interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z).

Ok, here's a different scenario. Imagine that z is a cube-with-a-hole (like a hollow cube). y is a sphere completely inside the hole of the cube, not touching the cube. x is a strange shape that extends from outside the cube, through the hole of the cube, to touch y at y's boundary. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary (where x enters the hole of the cube), but they wouldn't share any interior parts, satisfying EC(x,z).

But wait, that's not right either. NTPP(y,z) means y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary. In the scenario I just described, y is not part of z, but rather inside the hole of z. This doesn't satisfy NTPP(y,z). So this scenario doesn't work.

One more idea. Imagine two separate boxes: Box 1 and Box 2. Box 1 is contained within a larger Box z, not touching z's boundary, satisfying NTPP(Box 1, z). Box 2 is outside Box z. We can then define y as the union of Box 1 and Box 2. If x is a region that touches Box 2 but not Box 1, then EC(x,y) could hold while z and x are DC, since x doesn't interact with z at all.

However there's a problem with this scenario too. In it, y is a disconnected region. While disconnected regions are allowed in RCC-8, NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. If y has a part (Box 2) that's outside z, then y is not a proper part of z, which contradicts NTPP(y,z). So this scenario doesn't work.

Actually, I think I may be getting too caught up in the details. Let's approach this more systematics. Let me review the definitions once more.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Let's go through all eight relations between x and z and determine which ones are possible:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: If x and z are disconnected, they share no points. Given that y is completely inside z and x touches y, x must have some spatial relation with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: If x and z are externally connected, they touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. 

   Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x would have to extend from y's boundary. Since y is completely inside z and not touching z's boundary, any part of x that extends outward from y would either:
   - Stay completely inside z, in which case x would be a proper part of z (either TPP or NTPP), or
   - Extend all the way through z and beyond, in which case x would partially overlap with z.

   There doesn't seem to be a way for x to touch z at z's boundary without sharing any interior parts with z, given the constraints. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other.

   Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x must extend to y's boundary. If x extends beyond z, then it would partially overlap with z. This scenario is consistent with the given constraints. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: If x is a tangential proper part of z, x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

   Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x could be designed to be completely inside z and also touch z's boundary. This scenario is consistent with the given constraints. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

   Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x could be designed to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This scenario is consistent with the given constraints. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: If z is a tangential proper part of x, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

   Given that y is completely inside z, if z is inside x, then y would also be inside x. But this contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

   Similar to the previous case, if z is inside x, then y would also be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: If x and z are equal, they are coincident.

   If x and z are the same, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Let me double-check all of these one more time:

PO(x,z): Imagine z as a circle. y is a smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary. x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary and extends both inside z and outside z. This satisfies PO(x,z).

TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a circle. y is a smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary. x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary, is completely inside z, and touches z's boundary. This satisfies TPP(x,z).

NTPP(x,z): Imagine z as a circle. y is a smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary. x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary and is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This satisfies NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Actually, let me try to think of a scenario for EC(x,z) once more, just to make sure I'm not missing anything.

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x would have to extend from y's boundary.

Ok, try this: maybe the shapes are not simply connected, or they're not fully solid. What if:
- z is a solid cube
- y is a small solid ball inside z, not touching z's boundary
- x is a "shell" or "skin" that encases y exactly, touching y at all points on y's boundary, but x has no thickness or interior. It's just a boundary. x doesn't extend inward or outward from y's boundary.

In this case, x touches y at y's boundary, satisfying EC(x,y). y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, satisfying NTPP(y,z). And since x is just a shell around y, x is also completely inside z, but x doesn't have any interior parts to share with z. x is a boundary surface with no thickness.

But that's a degenerate case. In RCC-8, regions are typically assumed to be regular closed sets, which means they have a non-empty interior. A boundary with no thickness would not be a regular closed set.

Actually, EC(x,z) is truly not possible. Let me explain why. In RCC-8, we have the axiom: EC(x,y) implies C(x,y), which means if x and y are externally connected, then they are connected. And C(x,y) is defined as: x and y share at least one point. So if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must also be inside z at the point where it touches y. This means x and z share an interior point, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So my conclusion is correct: the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

One more time, let me double check my conclusion for all the cases.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: DC(x,z) means x and z share no points. Given that y is part of z, and x touches y, x must share at least one point with z (through y). Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Given that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)), x must share an interior point with z at the point where it touches y. This contradicts EC(x,z), so it's not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: PO(x,z) means x and z share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible: imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a shape that touches y at y's boundary and extends both inside z and outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: TPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible: imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a shape that touches y at y's boundary, is completely inside z, and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible: imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a shape that touches y at y's boundary and is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: TPPi(x,z) means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is completely inside z, if z is inside x, then y would also be inside x. But this contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: NTPPi(x,z) means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Similar to the previous case, if z is inside x, then y would also be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: EQ(x,z) means x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on my thorough analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Alright, so the answer is:

ANSWER:

I need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z when EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x touches y (EC(x,y)), x must have some connection to z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, x must share interior points with z at the point where it touches y, which contradicts the definition of EC.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at y's boundary while partially overlapping with z (extending both inside and outside z).

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z, touch z's boundary, and also touch y at y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y at y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x (since y is inside z), contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
