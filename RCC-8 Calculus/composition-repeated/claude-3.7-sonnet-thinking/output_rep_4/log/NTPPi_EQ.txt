PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the first relation: NTPPi(x,y). This means that NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Now for the second relation: EQ(y,z). This means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they are the same region.

So what does this mean for the relationship between x and z? If y and z are the same region, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. 

So the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check: 
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same region.
- Therefore, z is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the spatial relationship between x and z given that:
1. NTPPi(x,y) - which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary)
2. EQ(y,z) - which means y and z are coincident (they are the same region)

Since y and z are identical (EQ relationship), and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then z must also be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
