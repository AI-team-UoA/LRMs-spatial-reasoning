PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem step-by-step, considering the meanings of the given relations.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's visualize this:
- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any parts and don't touch.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is a proper part of y and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z. There's no way for x to touch or overlap with z if it doesn't even touch y, and z is completely contained within y (except possibly at the boundary).

But let's be systematic and consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
   This is possible because if x is disconnected from y, and z is part of y, then x would be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connected (touch at boundary).
   Is this possible? If x is disconnected from y, and z is part of y (touching y's boundary), could x touch z at the boundary? 
   Actually, no. If x is disconnected from y, it means x is separated from y by some distance. Since z is a part of y (even if touching y's boundary), z would also be separated from x by some distance. So x and z cannot be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Is this possible? If x and y don't share any parts, and z is part of y, then x and z also can't share any parts. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? If x is disconnected from y, it's disconnected from everything in y. Since z is part of y, x cannot be a part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? If z is part of y, and x is disconnected from y, then z cannot be part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Again, not possible for similar reasons.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are spatially equal.
   Is this possible? If x is disconnected from y, and z is part of y, then x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me verify these conclusions:

DC(x,y) means x and y have no shared parts and don't touch.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

If z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, then x must also be disconnected from z because z is completely contained within y (possibly touching y's boundary). Since x doesn't even touch y, it certainly can't touch z, which is inside y.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, let me recheck this. I'm a bit uncertain about the EC(x,z) case. If z touches y's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, could x and z possibly touch?

Actually, let's be more precise. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, y is a proper part of z and they touch at the boundary. This means y is properly contained in z, and y touches z's boundary.

Wait, I might have misinterpreted TPPi. Let me double-check:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b.
TPPi(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part inverse of b, which is equivalent to TPP(b,a).

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider:

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

If x is disconnected from y, and z is contained within y (touching y's boundary), then x must also be disconnected from z. There's no way for x to touch or overlap with z if it doesn't even touch y, and z is completely contained within y.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I want to think more carefully about whether EC(x,z) is possible. If z is a tangential proper part of y, it means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. And if x is disconnected from y, it means x and y don't share any parts and don't touch. 

If z touches y's boundary at a point (or region) where y doesn't touch x (which is always the case since x and y don't touch), then x and z won't touch either. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

In conclusion, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Oh wait, I think I misunderstood TPPi again. Let me clarify:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b, i.e., a is a proper part of b and a touches the boundary of b.
TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b), which is the same as TPP(b,a). This means b is a tangential proper part of a, i.e., b is a proper part of a and b touches the boundary of a.

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

I think I got confused by the notation. Let me make sure I understand now:

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

No, that's wrong. Let me try once more:

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which is the same as TPP(y,x). This means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, I'm still making errors. Let me be very clear:

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which is the same as TPP(y,x). This means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's say TPPi(a,b) means TPP(b,a). 

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

OK I finally get it. Let me go with how I understand this now:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and don't share any parts.
TPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, if x is disconnected from y, and y is a proper part of z, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is a proper part of z, z encompasses y and extends beyond it. Now, x is disconnected from y, but what about its relationship with the "rest" of z (the part of z that's not y)?

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Is this possible? If x is disconnected from y, it might still be disconnected from all of z, especially if x is far from the "rest" of z as well. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary.
   Is this possible? Even if x is disconnected from y, it could potentially touch the "rest" of z at its boundary. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Is this possible? Even if x is disconnected from y, it could overlap with the "rest" of z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? If x is disconnected from y but is entirely contained within the "rest" of z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? If x is disconnected from y but is entirely contained within the "rest" of z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? If z is contained within x and touches x's boundary, it would mean y is also contained within x (since y is a part of z). But this contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are spatially equal.
   Is this possible? If x and y are disconnected and y is a proper part of z, then x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think again. I'm making this more complex than it needs to be. 

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, TPPi(y,z) means y is a part of z, not the other way around. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which is equivalent to saying z is a tangential proper part of y, or TPP(z,y).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, if x is disconnected from y, and z is a part of y, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is a part of y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z. There's no way for x to touch or overlap with z if it doesn't even touch y, and z is completely contained within y (possibly touching y's boundary).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

OK hold on. I keep confusing myself about the meaning of TPPi. Let me look at this again. From the problem statement:

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So if TPPi(y,z), then that's the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, given that DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we have:
- x and y are disconnected
- z is a part of y and touches y's boundary

Now, if x is disconnected from y, and z is a part of y, then x must also be disconnected from z. This is because z is entirely contained within y (even if it touches y's boundary), and x doesn't even touch y. So, there's no way for x to have any connection with z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I'm not 100% sure. I think I need to be more visual about this.

DC(x,y) means x and y are completely separate, not touching and not overlapping.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y, but touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, if x doesn't even touch y, and z is inside y, then x can't touch or overlap with z. So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

I'll double-check once more to make sure.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected. This means they don't share any parts and they don't touch.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, if x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y touching y's boundary, then x must also be disconnected from z.

I think the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, wait. I just realized there might be another possibility. Let's look at the following scenario:

Let's say we have shapes y and z such that TPPi(y,z), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. Now, let's place x such that it's disconnected from y, but it's also encircling z.

Actually, no, this doesn't work. If z is inside y, and x encircles z, then x and y would have to touch or overlap, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, I'm back to my original conclusion: the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, one more check. What if x and z are placed in a way that they touch, but this touch is outside of y? But that's not possible because z is completely contained within y (except for the boundary), so if x touches z, it must also touch y, which contradicts DC(x,y).

I'm confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let's be systematic. I need to think of DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) as constraints, and then see which of the 8 RCC-8 relations between x and z satisfy these constraints.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, not touching, and not overlapping. 
   If x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, then x is also disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary.
   If z is inside y and touches y's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, then x can't touch z. So, EC(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap.
   If z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x can't overlap with z. So, PO(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x can't be a part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Again, if z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x can't be a part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then z can't be a part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Again, if z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then z can't be a part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are spatially equal.
   If z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x and z can't be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

Given the above analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hang on, now I'm not sure about my conclusion above. Let's carefully reconsider some of the options.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. If x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, then x is also disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is definitely possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary. If z is inside y and touches y's boundary, could there be a point on y's boundary where both x and z touch? No, because DC(x,y) means x and y don't touch at all, so x can't touch any part of y, including its boundary. Therefore, x can't touch z either. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. For x and z to overlap, they would need to share some region. But if z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x and z can't share any region. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x would need to be inside z and touch z's boundary. But if z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x can't be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would need to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But if z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then z can't be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are spatially equal. For this to be true, x and z would need to occupy the exact same space. But if z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x and z can't occupy the same space. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Given this exhaustive check, I'm now confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

The constraint DC(x,y) means that x and y are completely disjoint, not overlapping and not touching.
The constraint TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y, and z touches y's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. If x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, then x is also disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is definitely possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary. If z is inside y and touches y's boundary, could there be a point on y's boundary where both x and z touch? 

Wait, let's visualize this. Imagine y as a bigger circle, and z as a smaller circle inside y, with z touching y's boundary at a specific point. Now, place x outside of y. Given DC(x,y), x and y don't touch. But this doesn't mean x can't touch z at the point where z touches y's boundary. 

Actually, that's not right. If x touches z at the point where z touches y's boundary, then x would also touch y at that point, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Hang on. Let's be even more visual and think geometrically:

Imagine y as a circle on a 2D plane. Now, imagine z as a smaller circle inside y, with z touching y's boundary at a specific point, let's call it point P. Since z is touching y's boundary, there's a specific point where z and y touch.

Now, place x outside of y. Given DC(x,y), x and y don't touch. But this doesn't mean x can't be positioned in a way that it touches z at point P. If we place x to touch z at precisely the point P where z touches y's boundary, then x would also touch y at point P, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, it's not possible for x to touch z without also touching y, which means EC(x,z) is not a valid relation given the constraints.

And all of the other possibilities (overlap, or any subset relationship) would also contradict DC(x,y). 

I'm really satisfied now with the conclusion that the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

OK, one more time. I'm going to check the constraints DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) and what they mean.

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. They don't touch and don't overlap.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which is the same as TPP(z,y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

If z is properly contained in y, and x is disconnected from y, then x must also be disconnected from z. This is because z is a subset of y (considering the space it occupies), and if x doesn't touch or overlap with y, it can't touch or overlap with any subset of y.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), meaning x and z are disconnected.

OK, actually, let me think a bit differently this time. Instead of enumerating through all of the RCC-8 relations, let me just see what's possible.

I have DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), i.e., x is disconnected from y, and z is a tangential proper part of y.

If x and y don't overlap and don't touch, and z is completely inside y (except for touching y's boundary), then x and z must also not overlap and not touch.

If z is completely inside y, and x is completely outside y, then there's no way for x and z to touch or overlap. The only way for x and z to touch would be if z touches y's boundary and x is right outside y at that exact spot. But if x is right outside y, then x and y would touch, contradicting DC(x,y).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

I think we're done. To summarize, I've confirmed that DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, hang on. This conclusion relies on the idea that it's impossible for x to touch z at the point where z touches y's boundary without x also touching y at that point. And I think I should verify that.

Imagine y as a circle, and z as a smaller circle inside y, with z touching y's boundary at a specific point, let's call it point P. Now, imagine x as another circle outside of y. Can x touch z at point P without also touching y?

In a 2D Euclidean space, if two circles touch, they touch at a single point. If z touches y's boundary at a point P, and x touches z at the same point P, then x also touches y at point P. This is because all three circles would have a common point P. This contradicts DC(x,y).

Actually, let's zoom in on the boundary behavior. In the RCC calculus, regions are topologically closed, which means they include their boundary. If z touches y's boundary, it means they share a boundary point. And if x touches z at the boundary, they also share a boundary point. If x and z share a boundary point that's also on y's boundary, then x and y also share that point, making them connected, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, my original conclusion is correct: the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected - they don't share any points and don't touch
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y - z is completely inside y but touches y's boundary

Given these constraints, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Since z is completely contained within y (except where it touches y's boundary), and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z. There's no way for x to touch or overlap with z without also touching or overlapping with y, which would contradict DC(x,y).

Even at the point where z touches y's boundary, x cannot touch z there without also touching y at that same point, which would violate DC(x,y).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is disconnection.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
