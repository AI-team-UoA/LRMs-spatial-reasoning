PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

In this problem, we're given that:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze the situation:
- x and y partially overlap, so there are parts of x that are also parts of y.
- y is a tangential proper part of z, so all of y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
   This is not possible because x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z. At the very least, the part of x that overlaps with y will also be inside z. So x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y is such that it touches the boundary of z (which y also touches). In this case, x and z would share a boundary but no interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but other parts of x can be outside z. This would mean x and z share a spatial part, but neither is completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary. This could happen if, for example, x is mostly inside y and only touches the boundary of y at points where y also touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if all of x is inside z and x does not touch z's boundary. This could happen if, for example, x is completely inside y, and y is much smaller than z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z. Since x and y partially overlap, x cannot completely contain z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similarly, this would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This would mean x and z are the same spatial entity. But if PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x and z cannot be the same. If they were, then we would have PO(x,y) and TPP(y,x), which would mean y is part of x but also partially overlaps with x, which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

From this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning a bit more. I know that the relations are supposed to be jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint, so every possible spatial arrangement should correspond to exactly one of the eight relations.

Let's go through them again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is a part of z, at least some part of x must also be a part of z. So x and z cannot be disconnected. DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   This would mean x and z share a boundary but no interior parts. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y is inside z, x and z must share interior parts. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

I think my earlier analysis on EC was incorrect. Let's think about it more carefully.

If PO(x,y), then x and y share interior parts.
If TPP(y,z), then all of y, including its interior, is inside z.
So, the shared interior of x and y is also inside z.
This means x and z share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is completely inside the other. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is inside z, x and z share a spatial part (the part of x that overlaps with y). However, since x is not completely inside y (due to PO(x,y)), and y is inside z, x is also not completely inside z. This satisfies the first condition for PO(x,z).
   
   But what about the second condition, that z is not completely inside x? We know that y is inside z, but since x and y partially overlap, y is not completely inside x. This means z, which contains y, is also not completely inside x.
   
   So, both conditions for PO(x,z) are satisfied, making it a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean all of x is inside z, and x does not touch z's boundary. Again, given the conditions, it's possible that x is completely inside z and does not touch its boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean all of z is inside x, and z touches x's boundary. We know that y is inside z, and x partially overlaps with y. If all of z, which contains y, is inside x, then all of y would also be inside x. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which says that neither x nor y is completely inside the other. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similarly, this would mean all of z is inside x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This would mean x and z are the same spatial entity. If x and z are the same, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then y would be a tangential proper part of x. But this contradicts PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

From this more careful analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me think if there's something I missed here. Actually, I don't think my analysis of EC(x,z) is necessarily correct. Let's think about it differently:

If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other.
If TPP(y,z), then y is a part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, for EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at a boundary but not share any interior points.

But if x and y share interior points, and y is inside z, then x and z also share interior points (specifically, the interior points that x shares with y). This contradicts EC(x,z), which requires x and z to not share any interior points.

So EC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let's think about DC(x,z):

DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
If x and y share interior points (due to PO(x,y)), and y is inside z (due to TPP(y,z)), then x and z share spatial parts (the shared points of x and y). This contradicts DC(x,z).

So DC(x,z) is also not possible.

Let's just make sure my analysis of TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) is correct:

For TPP(x,z) to be true, all of x must be inside z, and x must touch z's boundary.
Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This means there are parts of x that are not inside y.
And given TPP(y,z), all of y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

So, the shared points of x and y are inside z. But for TPP(x,z) to be true, all of x, including the parts that don't overlap with y, must be inside z. This isn't guaranteed by the given conditions. Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), all of x must be inside z without touching z's boundary, which also isn't guaranteed.

Actually, let's think about this differently. I think I was overcomplicating things. Let's look at the possible spatial configurations given the constraints.

1. If PO(x,y), then x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This means there's a part of x inside y, a part of y inside x, and parts of both x and y that don't overlap.

2. If TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

The part of x that's inside y is also inside z (since y is inside z). But the part of x that's not inside y could be:
- Completely inside z (in which case all of x is inside z).
- Partially inside z and partially outside z.
- Completely outside z.

Additionally, if all of x is inside z, it could either touch z's boundary or not.

Based on these possibilities:

- If all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).
- If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).
- If part of x is inside z and part is outside, then PO(x,z).
- If the only part of x that's inside z is the part that overlaps with y, and this part touches z's boundary (which is possible if y touches z's boundary at a point where x and y overlap), then EC(x,z).
- If the only part of x that's inside z is the part that overlaps with y, and this part doesn't touch z's boundary, then neither x nor z is completely inside the other, and they share a spatial part, which corresponds to PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationships are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, I think I might be incorrect about EC(x,z). Let me reconsider.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
If PO(x,y), then x and y share interior parts.
If TPP(y,z), then all of y, including its interior, is inside z.
So, the shared interior of x and y is also inside z.
This means x and z share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Let's get to a final answer. Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I need to double-check my reasoning one more time. 

If PO(x,y) holds, then x and y partially overlap. There's a part of x that's also part of y, and there's a part of x that's not part of y.

If TPP(y,z) holds, then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means all of y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

For DC(x,z) to hold, x and z would have to be disconnected. But we know that x partially overlaps with y, and y is entirely inside z. So, at the very least, the part of x that overlaps with y is also inside z. This means x and z share spatial parts, so DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would have to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. But as I've reasoned earlier, since x and y share interior parts (due to PO(x,y)), and y is inside z (due to TPP(y,z)), x and z also share interior parts. This contradicts EC(x,z), so EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z would have to share a spatial part, but neither would be a part of the other. We know that x and z share a spatial part (the part of x that overlaps with y). For PO(x,z) to be true, x should not be entirely inside z, and z should not be entirely inside x. Since y is inside z, and z is at least as big as y, it's unlikely that z is entirely inside x. But can x be entirely inside z? Not necessarily. Given that x partially overlaps with y, there's a part of x that's not inside y. This part of x could be outside z, making PO(x,z) possible. Or it could be inside z, making either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) possible, depending on whether x touches z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would have to be inside z, and x would touch z's boundary. This is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z. And the part of x that doesn't overlap with y could also be inside z. If x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would have to be inside z, and x would not touch z's boundary. Again, this is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z. And the part of x that doesn't overlap with y could also be inside z. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, all of z would have to be inside x, and z would touch x's boundary. But we know that y is inside z, and x only partially overlaps with y. So, z cannot be entirely inside x. This means TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, all of z would have to be inside x, and z would not touch x's boundary. Similar to the reasoning for TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z would have to be the same. But if x and z were the same, then TPP(y,z) would be equivalent to TPP(y,x). This would mean y is entirely inside x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I am satisfied that this is the correct answer.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to consider what happens when:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z; all of y is inside z and y touches z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x partially overlaps with y, and all of y is inside z, at least the shared part of x and y must be inside z. So x and z cannot be disconnected.

EC(x,z): Not possible. The shared interior points of x and y must also be interior points of z (since y is inside z). This means x and z share interior points, contradicting EC.

PO(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x may have parts outside of z. This would make x and z partially overlap.

TPP(x,z): Possible. All of x could be inside z and touch z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z): Possible. All of x could be inside z without touching z's boundary.

TPPi(x,z): Not possible. This would require z to be inside x, but we know y is inside z and x only partially overlaps with y, so z cannot be contained in x.

NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be a tangential proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y).
