PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. 

We know that:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is part of y and x touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that y is part of z and y does not touch z's boundary.

Now we need to figure out what the relationship between x and z could be.

Since TPP(x,y), we know that x is completely inside y, touching y's boundary. And since NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

So, x is inside y, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary. What does this mean for the relationship between x and z?

Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, by transitivity, x must be inside z. But we need to determine if x touches z's boundary or not.

We know that x touches y's boundary, and y does not touch z's boundary. So y's boundary is completely inside z. Since x touches y's boundary, and y's boundary is completely inside z, x must also be completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, wait, let me think more carefully about this. We know that x touches y's boundary, but that doesn't tell us exactly where on y's boundary it touches. It's possible that x touches a part of y's boundary that is not touching z's boundary, in which case x would also not touch z's boundary. But it's also possible that x touches a part of y's boundary that, even though y doesn't touch z's boundary, x itself might extend all the way to z's boundary.

Actually, I don't think that's right either. Let's be more precise. 

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and y does not touch z's boundary.

Since y does not touch z's boundary, y is completely inside z with some distance to z's boundary. And since x is inside y, touching y's boundary but not extending outside y (since it's a proper part), x must also be completely inside z with some distance to z's boundary. Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But wait, let me double-check this by reasoning with the definitions more carefully.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is part of y and y is not part of x).
2. x touches y's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is part of z and z is not part of y).
2. y does not touch z's boundary.

Now, since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, by transitivity, x is a proper part of z. So, x is either a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

If x were to touch z's boundary, it would mean that x extends to z's boundary. But since y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is completely inside y (not extending outside y), x cannot reach z's boundary. Therefore, x cannot be a tangential proper part of z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually wait, I realized my reasoning is still potentially flawed. Let me reconsider this.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and y does not touch z's boundary.

Now, I need to be careful about the phrase "touches the boundary". In the context of RCC-8, I believe this means that the boundary of x has some point in common with the boundary of y. It doesn't mean that x extends all the way to the boundary of y from the inside.

Given that y does not touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), there's a spatial gap between the boundary of y and the boundary of z. This means that the entirety of y's boundary is inside z, away from z's boundary.

Now, TPP(x,y) means that x touches y's boundary. But this doesn't give x a "direct path" to z's boundary, because y's boundary is itself separated from z's boundary. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is inside z. And since y's boundary is inside z, away from z's boundary, any part of x that touches y's boundary is still inside z, away from z's boundary.

So, x is a proper part of z (through transitivity), and x does not touch z's boundary. This means NTPP(x,z).

But I've been going back and forth a bit. Let me think in an even clearer manner.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In the RCC-8 calculus, this means that the interiors of x and y share a point, and the boundaries of x and y also share a point, but x is not equal to y.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that the interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of z, and the boundaries of y and z do not share any points.

With TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. With NTPP(y,z), y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), it follows that x is strictly inside z as well, not touching z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think my reasoning is still a bit loose. Let me try one more time with a more formal approach:

1. TPP(x,y) means that the interior of x intersects with the interior of y, the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y, and x is a proper subset of y.

2. NTPP(y,z) means that the interior of y intersects with the interior of z, the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z, and y is a proper subset of z.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

From TPP(x,y), we know x is a proper subset of y.
From NTPP(y,z), we know y is a proper subset of z.
By transitivity, x is a proper subset of z.

Now, does the boundary of x intersect with the boundary of z?

From NTPP(y,z), we know the boundary of y doesn't intersect with the boundary of z. In other words, the boundary of y is inside the interior of z.

From TPP(x,y), we know the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y. But since the boundary of y is inside the interior of z, the boundary of x (where it intersects with the boundary of y) is also inside the interior of z.

So, the boundary of x does not intersect with the boundary of z. This, combined with the fact that x is a proper subset of z, means NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm. Actually I realize I'm not doing a good job being careful. Let me step back and think about the spatial relationships in a more careful manner.

In RCC-8, TPP(x,y) means:
1. x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is a proper subset of y).
2. The boundaries of x and y intersect (touch).

NTPP(y,z) means:
1. y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is a proper subset of z).
2. The boundaries of y and z do not intersect.

Now, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), what is the relationship between x and z?

From TPP(x,y), we know x is a proper subset of y.
From NTPP(y,z), we know y is a proper subset of z.
By transitivity, x is a proper subset of z.

Now, to determine if it's TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z), we need to know if the boundaries of x and z intersect.

From NTPP(y,z), the boundary of y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
From TPP(x,y), the boundary of x touches the boundary of y at some points.

The question is: Can the boundary of x intersect with the boundary of z, given these conditions?

The boundary of y is inside z, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y. But this doesn't necessarily mean the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. In fact, since the boundary of y is inside z (not touching the boundary of z), and the boundary of x only touches the boundary of y, it seems like the boundary of x must also be inside z, not touching the boundary of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But let's double-check this by thinking about this from a slightly different angle.

We know TPP(x,y), which means the region x is tangentially contained in region y. "Tangential" means the boundaries of x and y touch at some point.

We also know NTPP(y,z), which means the region y is non-tangentially contained in region z. "Non-tangential" means the boundaries of y and z do not touch at any point. There's a gap between the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Now, for the boundary of x to touch the boundary of z, it would have to extend beyond the boundary of y (since the boundary of y is completely inside z). But this would violate the condition that x is a part of y. So, the boundary of x can't touch the boundary of z.

Hence, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Okay so my final answer to the question "If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I realize I should be more careful about this. Let me go back to the definitions:

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, if x is a tangential proper part of y, it means that x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary. If y is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means that y is fully contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. So, y's boundary is strictly inside z.

Given that x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary, and y's boundary is strictly inside z, it follows that x is fully contained within z. Now, does x touch z's boundary? Since x touches y's boundary, and y's boundary is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), x does not touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which is NTPP(x,z).

Alright, so the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). But just to triple-check, let me try to think of a counter-example. Could there be a scenario where the relationship between x and z is not NTPP(x,z)?

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), could x and z be related by any of the other RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,z)? No, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x is inside z. They cannot be disconnected.
- EC(x,z)? No, because for x to touch z's boundary, it would need to touch y's boundary and y would need to touch z's boundary. But NTPP(y,z) means y does not touch z's boundary.
- PO(x,z)? No, because x is fully inside y, and y is fully inside z, so x is fully inside z. They cannot partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z)? No, because for x to be tangential to z, it would need to touch z's boundary. But as established, x cannot touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z)? No, because x is fully inside z, so z cannot be a part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z)? No, for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).
- EQ(x,z)? No, because x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x is a proper part of z. They cannot be equal.

None of the other relations are possible, so the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Okay, I just realized a logical error I've been making. I've been assuming that "tangential" and "non-tangential" are just to do with whether the parts touch, but they don't say whether the boundaries of the parts touch the whole. To avoid any confusion, let me just use the clear and official definitions:

TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and x connects with the boundary of y.
NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and x does not connect with the boundary of y.

Now let's break down the problem:

1. TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x connects with the boundary of y.
2. NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y does not connect with the boundary of z.

So, x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z. By transitivity, x is a proper part of z.

Now, the question is whether x connects with the boundary of z. Given that y does not connect with the boundary of z (i.e., there's a "buffer" between y and the boundary of z), and x is fully contained within y, it seems logical that x also does not connect with the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I noticed something else. The relationship between x and z must be one of the eight RCC-8 relations. So, another way to approach this is to check each relation and see if it's consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's do this for all the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected. This would mean x and z don't share any points. But since x is part of y and y is part of z, x is also part of z. So, x and z are not disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Externally connected. This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. But since x is part of y and y is part of z, x is also part of z, sharing interior points. So, x and z are not externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. This would mean x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. But we've established that x is a part of z. So, x and z are not partially overlapping.

4. TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part. This would mean x is a proper part of z and connects with the boundary of z. We've established that x is a proper part of z. But does x connect with the boundary of z? Given that y does not connect with the boundary of z, and x is inside y, it seems x cannot connect with the boundary of z. So, x is not a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part. This would mean x is a proper part of z and does not connect with the boundary of z. We've established that x is a proper part of z. Given that y does not connect with the boundary of z, and x is inside y, it seems x also does not connect with the boundary of z. So, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Inverse of TPP. This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since x is a part of z, z cannot be a part of x (unless they are the same, which is not the case for a proper part). So, z is not a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Inverse of NTPP. This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, since x is a part of z, z cannot be a part of x. So, z is not a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Equal. This would mean x and z are the same region. But since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, and y is not equal to z, x cannot be equal to z. So, x and z are not equal.

From this analysis, the only consistent relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait. I realized the relations and their definitions. Let me make sure I use the right definitions.

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, sharing no points.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, touching at their boundaries but sharing no interior points.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some points in their interiors.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and the boundary of x does not touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal, occupying the same space.

Now, let's reconsider the problem with these definitions:

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and the boundary of y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z. By transitivity, x is a proper part of z. We need to determine if the boundary of x touches the boundary of z.

Given that the boundary of y does not touch the boundary of z, and x is fully contained within y, the boundary of x cannot touch the boundary of z. This is because for the boundary of x to touch the boundary of z, it would have to "extend" beyond the boundary of y, which is not possible if x is a proper part of y.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I think I'm overthinking this. Let me reason one more time:

TPP(x,y) means:
1. x is a proper part of y.
2. The boundary of x touches the boundary of y.

NTPP(y,z) means:
1. y is a proper part of z.
2. The boundary of y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, from these, we can deduce:
1. x is a proper part of z (by transitivity).
2. The boundary of y is strictly inside z.
3. The boundary of x touches the boundary of y at some points.
4. Since the boundary of y is strictly inside z, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y, the boundary of x is also inside z and does not touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me double-check my logic. We know that the boundary of x touches the boundary of y, and the boundary of y does not touch the boundary of z. This means that the portion of the boundary of x that touches the boundary of y cannot touch the boundary of z. But could there be another portion of the boundary of x that extends to the boundary of z without touching the boundary of y?

No, that's not possible. If such a portion of the boundary of x existed, it would mean that part of x is outside of y, which contradicts the fact that x is a proper part of y. So, the entire boundary of x is either within the interior of y or touching the boundary of y. And since the boundary of y does not touch the boundary of z, the boundary of x cannot touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is indeed NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I've been overcomplicating this. Let me reason straightforwardly:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. x is completely inside y.
2. x touches the boundary of y.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. y is completely inside z.
2. y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, if x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, then x is completely inside z. And if y does not touch the boundary of z, and x is inside y, then x also does not touch the boundary of z. This is because, for x to touch the boundary of z, it would need to "escape" from y, which is not possible if x is a proper part of y.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Just to be triple sure, let's check if any other relation makes sense.

DC(x,z)? No, because x is inside z, so they are not disconnected.
EC(x,z)? No, because x is inside z, not touching the boundary of z. For them to be externally connected, x would need to touch the boundary of z without sharing interior points, which is not the case.
PO(x,z)? No, because x is completely inside z, not just partially overlapping with z.
TPP(x,z)? No, because x does not touch the boundary of z, which is a requirement for x to be a tangential proper part of z.
NTPP(x,z)? Yes, because x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z.
TPPi(x,z)? No, because z is not a proper part of x. In fact, x is a proper part of z.
NTPPi(x,z)? No, for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).
EQ(x,z)? No, because x is a proper part of z, so they are not equal.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So the final answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relationships tell us:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

From these facts:
1. Since x is inside y (from TPP(x,y)) and y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), by transitivity, x must be inside z.
2. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and x is contained within y, x cannot touch z's boundary either.

Therefore, x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
