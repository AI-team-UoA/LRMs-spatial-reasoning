PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem systematically. 

We know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no parts)

We need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. Given that DC(y,z), y and z are completely disconnected.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - This is definitely possible. If x touches y at a boundary, and z is completely disconnected from y, then x could also be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   - This is also possible. x could touch y at one part of its boundary, and touch z at another part of its boundary, while y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - This is possible. x could touch y at a boundary, while having some interior parts that overlap with z, even though y and z are disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - This is possible. x could be inside z and touch z's boundary, while y touches x at a boundary point that's also on z's boundary. y and z would still be disconnected.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - This is possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while y touches x at x's boundary (which is inside z). y and z would still be disconnected.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - This is possible. z could be inside x and touch x's boundary, while y touches x at a different part of x's boundary. y and z would still be disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - This is possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while y touches x at x's boundary. y and z would still be disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   - This seems problematic. If x and z are equal, and x touches y, then z would also touch y, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Let me double-check this last case:
If EQ(x,z), then x and z are identical. But we know EC(x,y), which means x touches y. If x and z are identical, then z would also touch y, which would be EC(z,y). But we're given DC(y,z), which means y and z are disconnected. So there's a contradiction, and EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Let me also check if there are any other contradictions I might have missed:

For TPP(x,z), we have x touching z's boundary and being completely inside z. We also have EC(x,y), so y touches x's boundary. Since x is inside z, y would either have to overlap with z or touch z's boundary to touch x. But we're given DC(y,z), which means y and z are disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. For y to touch x, y would have to overlap with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's revisit the remaining cases:

For DC(x,z), we have x and z disconnected, and EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). This is consistent because x can touch y at a boundary, and both x and y can be disconnected from z.

For EC(x,z), we have x and z touching at a boundary, EC(x,y), and DC(y,z). This is consistent because x can touch both y and z at different parts of its boundary, while y and z remain disconnected.

For PO(x,z), we have x and z partially overlapping, EC(x,y), and DC(y,z). This is consistent because x can overlap with z and also touch y at a boundary, while y and z remain disconnected.

For TPPi(x,z), we have z as a tangential proper part of x, EC(x,y), and DC(y,z). This is consistent because z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, y can touch x at a different part of x's boundary, and y and z can remain disconnected.

For NTPPi(x,z), we have z as a non-tangential proper part of x, EC(x,y), and DC(y,z). This is consistent because z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, y can touch x at x's boundary, and y and z can remain disconnected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, let me double-check TPP(x,z) again. I think I made an error in my reasoning.

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. We also know EC(x,y), meaning y touches x's boundary. Since x touches z's boundary, y could touch x at a point where x also touches z's boundary. This means y would also touch z's boundary, which would be EC(y,z), contradicting DC(y,z). 

But what if y touches x at a point of x's boundary that doesn't coincide with z's boundary? In that case, since x is entirely within z, y would have to intersect with z to touch x, which would contradict DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not a possible relationship.

Now, let me double-check NTPP(x,z) again.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. We also know EC(x,y), meaning y touches x's boundary. Since x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, for y to touch x, y would have to penetrate into z, which would mean y and z overlap. This contradicts DC(y,z), which states that y and z are disconnected.

So, NTPP(x,z) is also not a possible relationship.

OK, I think I've overthought a bit here. Let me approach it differently:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they don't share any parts, not even boundary points).

Let's visualize this:
x touches y at their boundaries, but they don't overlap.
y and z are completely separated, not even touching.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - This is possible. x touches y, y is disconnected from z, so x can also be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   - This is possible. x can touch z at a boundary, touch y at a different boundary, and y can still be disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - This is possible. x can overlap with z, touch y at a boundary, and y can still be disconnected from z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - For this, x is inside z and touches z's boundary. We also know EC(x,y), meaning y touches x's boundary. For this to be consistent with DC(y,z), y should touch x at a point that doesn't coincide with z's boundary (since that would make y and z touch, contradicting DC(y,z)). But if x is entirely within z, and y touches x, then y must intersect with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - For this, x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. We also know EC(x,y), meaning y touches x's boundary. But if x is inside z, and y touches x, then y must intersect with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - For this, z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) because y can touch x at a different boundary than where z touches x, and y and z can remain disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - For this, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) because y can touch x at x's boundary, z is inside x without touching x's boundary, and y and z can remain disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   - If x and z are equal, and x touches y, then z would also touch y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me just double check once more: 

For the case TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), I think there's a flaw in my reasoning.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- y touches x's boundary (EC(x,y)).
- y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)).

The contradiction arises because if y touches x, and x is inside z, then y must intersect with z (either by overlapping or touching), which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
- y touches x's boundary (EC(x,y)).
- y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)).

Again, if y touches x, and x is inside z, then y must intersect with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me think even more carefully about the case TPP(x,z). We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

I'll set up a simple example. Let's say z is a circle, and x is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a point p. Now, for EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. If y touches x at point p, then y would also touch z at point p, which would make EC(y,z), contradicting DC(y,z). If y touches x at any other point on x's boundary, since x is inside z, y would have to cross z's boundary to touch x, making PO(y,z) or EC(y,z), both contradicting DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not a possible relation.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to cross z's boundary to touch x, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is also not a possible relation.

Let's move on to TPPi(x,z), where z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) if y touches x at a different part of x's boundary than where z touches x. This way, y and z can remain disconnected.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) because y can touch x at x's boundary, z is inside x without touching x's boundary, and y and z can remain disconnected.

Lastly, let me also make sure about PO(x,z). For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) if y touches x at a part of x's boundary that doesn't overlap with z. In this way, y and z can remain disconnected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I think I might have overlooked some issues with TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) as well. Let me redo this entire reasoning, thinking carefully about geometric configurations:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

Let's carefully analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is clearly possible. Imagine a scenario where x is touching y at one point, and z is far away, disconnected from both x and y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
   This is also possible. Imagine x touching y at one boundary point and touching z at a different boundary point. y and z can still be disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This can work if x overlaps with z in an area away from where x touches y. y can touch x at a part of x's boundary that doesn't overlap with z, and thus y and z remain disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   In this case, x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if y touches x (as per EC(x,y)), and x is inside z, then y would have to intersect with z to touch x. This contradicts DC(y,z), which says y and z are disconnected. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Here, x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, if y touches x (as per EC(x,y)), y would have to intersect with z to touch x, contradicting DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   In this case, z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is compatible with EC(x,y) if y touches x at a different part of x's boundary than where z touches x. y and z can remain disconnected in this scenario.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Here, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is compatible with EC(x,y) because y can touch x at x's boundary, z is inside x without touching x's boundary, and y and z can remain disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same, and x touches y (as per EC(x,y)), then z would also touch y. This contradicts DC(y,z), which says y and z are disconnected. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I'm pretty confident that these are the correct possibilities.

Oh wait, I just realized, let's think a bit more. For TPPi(x,z):

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- y touches x's boundary (EC(x,y)).
- y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)).

If z touches x's boundary, and y also touches x's boundary, there's a chance that they touch the same point on x's boundary. If they do, then y and z would touch, contradicting DC(y,z). But, they don't have to touch the same point. z can touch x's boundary at one point, and y can touch x's boundary at a different point, ensuring that y and z remain disconnected.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Since z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches x at the boundary, y and z can remain disconnected.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also a possible relation.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The relationships that are not possible are:
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

So, the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze which of the eight possible RCC-8 relations could hold between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me examine each possibility:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   This is possible. x touches y at a boundary, and z is completely disconnected from y, so x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary
   This is possible. x can touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part, while y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   This is possible. x can overlap with z in a region that doesn't include where x touches y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   Not possible. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches x (from EC(x,y)), then y would have to intersect z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   Not possible. If x is completely inside z, and y touches x, then y would have to intersect z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. z can be inside x touching x's boundary at a different location than where y touches x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. z can be completely inside x, while y touches x at its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   Not possible. If x and z are identical, and x touches y, then z would also touch y, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
