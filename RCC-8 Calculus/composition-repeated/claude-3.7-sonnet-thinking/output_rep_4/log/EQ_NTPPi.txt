PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step. 

We have two given relationships:
1. EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (the same region).
2. NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. This means that any relationship y has with another region, x will have the same relationship with that region.

Given that NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), we know that z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same (EQ(x,y)), then z must also be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. This means NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between z and x must be the same as the relationship between z and y, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine how x and z relate given that x equals y and y contains z as a non-tangential proper part.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same region)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), they are essentially the same region. This means any spatial relationship y has with another region, x must have the same relationship with that region.

Since y contains z as a non-tangential proper part (NTPPi(y,z)), and x is the same as y, then x must also contain z as a non-tangential proper part.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
