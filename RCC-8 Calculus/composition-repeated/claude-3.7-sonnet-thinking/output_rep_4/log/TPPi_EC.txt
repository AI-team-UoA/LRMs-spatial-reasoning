PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think carefully about the relationships.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

Now, let's think about what the relationship between x and z could be.

Since y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at the boundary, there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z.

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC): This is not possible. If y is a part of x, and y touches z, then x and z cannot be disconnected. At the very least, x and z would touch at the boundary where y touches z.

2. x and z could be externally connected (EC): This is possible. If y touches x's boundary at the same place that y touches z's boundary, then x and z would touch at that point without sharing interior points.

3. x and z could partially overlap (PO): This is possible. x could overlap with z, where some parts of z are inside x (where y is) and some parts of z are outside x.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP): This doesn't seem possible. If y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then it doesn't seem like x could be entirely contained within z.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP): This is not possible for the same reasons as TPP.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi): This is possible. z could be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary at the same place where y touches x's boundary.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi): This is not possible because we know that z touches y at the boundary, and y touches x's boundary, so z would also touch x's boundary.

8. x and z could be equal (EQ): This is not possible, because if x and z were equal, then y would be a proper part of z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So the possible relationships are: EC, PO, and TPPi.

Hmm, I think my reasoning isn't completely sound. Let me think more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

Now let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since y is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and y also touches z at the boundary, we know that z must touch x at the boundary (at the same point where y touches z). But we don't know anything else about z's relationship with x. 

So z could:
1. just touch x at the boundary (EC)
2. partially overlap with x (PO)
3. be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)

Let's test if there are any other possibilities:

4. DC (disconnected): If z is disconnected from x, then it would also be disconnected from y, which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP (non-tangential proper part): If x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, then y would also be completely inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

6. NTPPi (inverse non-tangential proper part): If z is completely inside x without touching its boundary, then it couldn't touch y at the boundary (since y touches x's boundary), which contradicts EC(y,z).

7. TPP (tangential proper part): If x is completely inside z and touches its boundary, then y would also be inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

8. EQ (equal): If x and z are the same, then y would be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So the possible relationships are: EC, PO, and TPPi.

Wait, I'm still not being rigorous enough. Let me think again from scratch using the precise definitions.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x
- y touches x's boundary

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. This means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z do not share interior points

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

First, we know that y is entirely contained within x, and y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary. So at the very least, x and z touch at the boundary (at the point where y touches z).

Let's go through each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected): This is not possible. If y is a part of x and y touches z, then x and z cannot be disconnected. At the very least, x and z would touch at the boundary where y touches z.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected): This is possible. x and z could touch at the boundary without sharing interior points. Specifically, they would touch at the point where y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping): This is possible. x and z could overlap, where some parts of z are inside x and some parts are outside.

4. TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part): This would mean x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. But if y is entirely contained within x, and y touches z only at the boundary, then x cannot be entirely contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part): This would mean x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. This is not possible for the same reasons as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) (inverse tangential proper part): This would mean z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (inverse non-tangential proper part): This would mean z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary. But we know that z touches y, and y touches x's boundary, so z must also touch x's boundary, which contradicts the definition of NTPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) (equal): This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x and z cannot be the same region.

So the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I realize that I'm still making an error. Let me try to be even more careful.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely contained within x, and y touches x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. In other words, y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

Now let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since y is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at the boundary, we know that z touches x at the boundary. But we need to be more careful about what else could be true about the relationship between x and z.

Let's go through each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible. Since y touches z, and y is a part of x, x and z must at least touch.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points. This is possible. x and z could touch at the point where y touches z, without sharing any interior points.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is contained within the other. This is possible. z could overlap with x, with some parts of z inside x and some parts of z outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This is not possible. If y is a proper part of x and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be entirely contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. This is not possible for the same reasons as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. z could be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary at the point where y touches z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary. This is not possible. Since y touches z, and y touches x's boundary, z must also touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is not possible. If y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x and z cannot be the same region.

So the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Wait, I'm making some unfounded assumptions. Let me look at this one more time.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x (y is entirely contained within x), and y touches x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. In other words, y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

Now let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

First, we can eliminate some relations immediately:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is a part of x) and z would also be disconnected, which contradicts EC(y,z).

2. NTPP(x,z): If x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then y (which is a part of x) would also be entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, which contradicts EC(y,z).

3. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, then y would be a proper part of z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

4. NTPPi(x,z): If z is entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary, then z couldn't touch y at the boundary (since y touches x's boundary), which contradicts EC(y,z).

Now let's look at the remaining possibilities:

5. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and z could touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points. The point where they touch would be on the boundary of y.

6. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z could partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is contained within the other. 

7. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. I initially said this was not possible, but I need to reconsider. If y is a proper part of x and y touches z at the boundary, then x could still be entirely contained within z, with x touching z's boundary at the point where y touches z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

8. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. 

So the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Wait, I'm still being careless. Let me think one more time.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x (y is entirely contained within x), and y touches x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. In other words, y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is a part of x) and z would also be disconnected, which contradicts EC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points. If y touches z at the boundary, and y is part of x, then x and z touch at least at that point. And if x and z don't share interior points, then the relation is EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is contained within the other. If y touches z at the boundary, and y is part of x, then it's possible for x and z to share interior points in a way that neither is contained within the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. If y is part of x and y touches z at the boundary, and y also touches x's boundary, then x touches z's boundary at the same point. It's possible for the rest of x to be contained within z, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. But we know that y touches z's boundary, and y is part of x, so x must also touch z's boundary. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. If y touches z at the boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then z touches x's boundary at the same point. It's possible for the rest of z to be contained within x, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary. But if y touches z at the boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary at the same point. This contradicts NTPPi(x,z), so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. This contradicts EQ(x,z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm still making a mistake about TPP(x,z). Let me think more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x (y is entirely contained within x), and y touches x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. In other words, y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely contained within z, and x must touch z's boundary. But since y is entirely contained within x, and y touches z at the boundary, the point where y touches z must be on the boundary of x as well. 

Now, the condition TPPi(x,y) means that y touches the boundary of x. Combined with EC(y,z), this means y touches both the boundary of x and the boundary of z. 

If x were entirely contained within z (as required by TPP(x,z)), then the boundary of x would have to be either completely inside z or partially on the boundary of z. Since y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of z, the boundary of x must touch the boundary of z at least at that point.

So, x touches the boundary of z. But for TPP(x,z) to be true, x must also be entirely contained within z. 

Let's think about this visually: Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside x but touching the boundary of x, and z as a larger circle containing x with x touching the boundary of z exactly at the point where y touches the boundary of both x and z.

In this case, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

So the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check the TPP(x,z) case more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch but don't overlap.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z.

Since y is a proper part of x, y is inside x. And since y touches the boundary of x, there's at least one point p that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x.

Now, y and z touch but don't overlap, so there's at least one point q that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

If p and q are the same point, then that point is on the boundary of x, the boundary of y, and the boundary of z. This means x and z touch at that point.

If p and q are different points, then y has at least two points on its boundary: one touching the boundary of x, and one touching the boundary of z. In this case, it's still possible for x to be a proper part of z and to touch the boundary of z at the point q.

So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let's also check the TPPi(x,z) case to make sure.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x and must touch the boundary of x.

We know that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. We also know that y and z touch but don't overlap. So there's at least one point that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

It's possible for z to be entirely inside x, with z touching the boundary of x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, TPPi(x,z) is true.

So the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Wait, I've been assuming that because y touches the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then x and z must touch at their boundaries. But this isn't necessarily true.

Let's think again.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch but don't overlap.

When we say y touches the boundary of x, we mean there's a point p that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x. Similarly, when we say y and z touch, we mean there's a point q that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Points p and q can be different. If they are, then y has at least two points on its boundary: one touching the boundary of x, and one touching the boundary of z. In this case, x and z don't necessarily touch each other.

So let's go through each relation again:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is a part of x) and z would also be disconnected, which contradicts EC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points. This is possible if the point where y touches x's boundary is the same as the point where y touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is contained within the other. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. This is possible if the point where y touches x's boundary is the same as the point where y touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. This is not possible. If y touches z's boundary, and y is part of x, then x must also touch z's boundary. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if the point where y touches x's boundary is the same as the point where y touches z's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary. This is not possible. If y touches z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary at the same point. This contradicts NTPPi(x,z), so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is not possible. If y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. This contradicts EQ(x,z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me carefully reason about each case. I think I've been making some errors.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch but don't overlap.

Let's analyze each relation:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is a part of x) and z would also be disconnected, which contradicts EC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points. This is possible. If y touches the boundary of x and also touches z, then x and z touch at least at that point.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is contained within the other. This is possible. x and z could overlap in a way that y is in the overlapping region, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. If y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of z, then x also touches the boundary of z at that point. The rest of x could be entirely contained within z, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. But we know y touches the boundary of z, and y is part of x, so x must also touch the boundary of z. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. If y touches the boundary of x and also touches z, then z touches the boundary of x at that point. The rest of z could be entirely contained within x, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary. But if y touches the boundary of x and also touches z, then z must also touch the boundary of x at that point. This contradicts NTPPi(x,z), so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If y is a proper part of x and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. This contradicts EQ(x,z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Wait a minute - I'm just repeating myself. Let me try to break my reasoning down more systematically. We know:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

When we say "y touches the boundary of x", there's a point p that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x.

When we say "y touches z", there's a point q that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

The key insight is that p and q can be the same point or different points.

Case 1: p and q are the same point.
This means there's a point that is simultaneously on the boundary of x, the boundary of y, and the boundary of z. In this case, x and z touch at their boundaries.

Case 2: p and q are different points.
This means y has at least two points on its boundary: one touching the boundary of x, and one touching the boundary of z. In this case, x and z don't necessarily touch each other.

Given these cases, let's analyze the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): In both cases, x and z cannot be disconnected, because that would imply y and z are disconnected, which contradicts EC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): In Case 1, x and z touch at their boundaries, so EC(x,z) is possible. In Case 2, x and z might or might not touch, so EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): In both cases, x and z could partially overlap, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): In Case 1, x touches the boundary of z, so TPP(x,z) is possible if the rest of x is contained within z. In Case 2, x might or might not touch the boundary of z, so TPP(x,z) might be possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): In Case 1, x touches the boundary of z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). In Case 2, x might not touch the boundary of z, so NTPP(x,z) might be possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): In Case 1, z touches the boundary of x, so TPPi(x,z) is possible if the rest of z is contained within x. In Case 2, z might or might not touch the boundary of x, so TPPi(x,z) might be possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): In Case 1, z touches the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z). In Case 2, z might not touch the boundary of x, so NTPPi(x,z) might be possible.

8. EQ(x,z): In both cases, if y is a proper part of x and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I'm complicating things unnecessarily. I need to focus on the constraint that y is a part of x. Given that, we have:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

If y is a proper part of x, then every point of y is a point of x. So if y touches z, then x also touches z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Now let's analyze the rest:

2. EC(x,z): If y touches z at the boundary and doesn't overlap with z, and y is entirely within x, then x and z might touch at the boundary without sharing interior points. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap, sharing some interior points but not all. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z. We know y touches the boundary of z, and y is a proper part of x, so x touches the boundary of z. The rest of x could be entirely contained within z, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z. But we know y touches the boundary of z, and y is a part of x, so x must also touch the boundary of z. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be a proper part of x and must touch the boundary of x. If y touches the boundary of x and also touches z, then z could touch the boundary of x at that point. The rest of z could be entirely contained within x, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. But if y touches the boundary of x and also touches z, then z might also touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) may not be possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If y is a proper part of x and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. This contradicts EQ(x,z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me try once more with clearer reasoning.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

For DC(x,z), x and z are disconnected. If y is a part of x and y touches z, then x and z cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Since y is a part of x and y touches z, x and z touch at least at the point where y touches z. If the rest of x and z don't overlap, then EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained within the other. Since y is a part of x and y touches z, x and z touch at least at the point where y touches z. The rest of x and z could overlap in a way that neither is contained within the other, so PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. Since y is a part of x and y touches z, x touches z at least at the point where y touches z. The rest of x could be entirely contained within z, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z. But since y is a part of x and y touches the boundary of z, x must also touch the boundary of z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. Since y touches the boundary of x and also touches z, z could touch the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. The rest of z could be entirely contained within x, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. If y touches the boundary of x and also touches z, then z touches the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. This contradicts NTPPi(x,z), so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. But if y is a proper part of x and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. This contradicts EQ(x,z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I'm forgetting something. The statement "y touches the boundary of z" doesn't mean y touches the entire boundary of z. It just means there's at least one point that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Let me re-examine the NTPPi(x,z) case.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. But we know y touches the boundary of x, and y touches z. Does this mean z touches the boundary of x? Not necessarily. It's possible for y to touch the boundary of x at one point and touch z at a different point. In this case, z could still be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

Wait, I have to be more careful. Let's consider what it means for y to touch z. Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. So there's a point q that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider what it means for y to touch the boundary of x. Since TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. So there's a point p that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x.

The key question is: can p and q be the same point? If they are, then z touches the boundary of x at that point, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible. If they are different, then z could still be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

Actually, even if p and q are different, can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? If y touches z, and y touches the boundary of x, then z is close to the boundary of x. But being close to the boundary doesn't mean touching the boundary. It's still possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x.

OK I think I'm over-complicating this. Let me focus on the specific problem.

If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), what can we say about the possible relations between x and z?

For TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
For EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Let's take a more visual approach. Imagine x as a region, and y as a smaller region inside x, touching the boundary of x. Now, z is a region that touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

From this picture, we can see that:

1. DC(x,z) is not possible. If y touches z, and y is inside x, then x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) is possible. If z only touches y at the boundary, and doesn't overlap with x, then x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) is possible. If z overlaps with x, but neither is contained within the other, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) is possible. If x is entirely contained within z, and x touches the boundary of z at the point where y touches z, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) is not possible. If y is inside x and y touches z, then x must also touch z, which contradicts the definition of NTPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) is possible. If z is entirely contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) is not possible. Since y touches the boundary of x and y touches z, z must be close to the boundary of x. If z is entirely contained within x, it must touch the boundary of x, which contradicts the definition of NTPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) is not possible. If y is a proper part of x and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z.

So the possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I'm not sure about NTPPi(x,z). Let me think about it one more time.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

We know y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y touches z (from EC(y,z)). 

Could z still be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x? If y touches z, and y touches the boundary of x, the question is whether z must also touch the boundary of x.

Wait, I think I see the issue: if y touches z, and y touches the boundary of x, then for z to be non-tangential to x, z would have to be some distance away from the boundary of x. But this contradicts the fact that y touches both z and the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

But hold on, I'm overthinking this again. Let me try once more.

If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), what are the possible relations between x and z?

For TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
For EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Let's go through the RCC-8 relations systematically:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. If y is part of x and y touches z, then x and z cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping. If y is part of x and y touches z at the boundary, then x and z touch at least at the point where y touches z. If the rest of x and z don't overlap, then EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained within the other. If y is part of x and y touches z at the boundary, then x and z touch at least at the point where y touches z. The rest of x and z could overlap in a way that neither is contained within the other, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. If y is part of x and y touches z at the boundary, then x touches z at least at the point where y touches z. The rest of x could be entirely contained within z, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If y is part of x and y touches z at the boundary, then x touches z at least at the point where y touches z. This contradicts the definition of NTPP, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. If y is part of x, y touches the boundary of x, and y touches z at the boundary, then z could be entirely contained within x and touch the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If y is part of x, y touches the boundary of x, and y touches z at the boundary, then z must also touch the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. This contradicts the definition of NTPPi, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If y is a proper part of x and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. This contradicts EQ(x,z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Hold on, I need to be clearer about TPPi(x,y). It means y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x. It doesn't mean y touches all of the boundary of x. It just means y touches the boundary of x at least at one point. The situation with EC(y,z) is similar.

Let me try again, but I want to think through each relation in terms of concrete examples to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Let's set up a concrete situation. Here's the setting:
- x is a disk in the plane.
- y is a smaller disk, contained within x, which touches the boundary of x at a single point p.
- z is a third disk, which touches the boundary of y at a single point q, but does not overlap with y.

We're told that TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), which means y is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, and y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. These conditions are satisfied in our concrete situation.

We want to know: what are the possible relations between x and z?

Let's go through the RCC-8 relations one by one:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? No, because z touches y, and y is inside x, so x and z must at least touch. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping? Yes. In our concrete example, if z touches y only at the point q, and q is inside x, then x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained within the other? Yes. If z extends into x, but also extends outside of x, then x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes. If z is a larger disk that contains x, and x touches the boundary of z at some point, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No. If y touches z at the boundary, and y is inside x, then x must also touch z at the boundary. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes. If z is a smaller disk, contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x at some point, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Let's think about this carefully. NTPPi(x,z) means z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x. But if y touches z at the boundary, and y touches the boundary of x, does that mean z must also touch the boundary of x? Not necessarily. In our concrete example, if y touches the boundary of x at point p, and y touches the boundary of z at a different point q, then z can be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be the same region? If y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hold on, I think I've been making a mistake in thinking about NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, one more time from the beginning. We know:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Let's think about a concrete example:
- x is a disk in the plane.
- y is a smaller disk, contained within x, which touches the boundary of x at a single point p.
- z is a third disk, which touches the boundary of y at a single point q, but does not overlap with y.

So the point q is on the boundary of both y and z. But q might or might not be on the boundary of x. It depends on where q is relative to p.

Now, let's analyze the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? No, because z touches y, and y is inside x, so x and z must at least touch. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping? Yes. In our concrete example, if q is on the boundary of x, then x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained within the other? Yes. If z extends into x, but also extends outside of x, then x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes. If z is a larger disk that contains x, and x touches the boundary of z at some point, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No. If y touches z at the boundary, and y is inside x, then x must also touch z at the boundary. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes. If z is a smaller disk, contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x at some point, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? NTPPi(x,z) means z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x. I think this is possible under the right circumstances. We know y touches the boundary of z at a point q, and y touches the boundary of x at a point p. If p and q are different points, and q is inside x (not on the boundary of x), then z could be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be the same region? If y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I still need to be more careful about NTPPi(x,z). Let's think about it again.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

We know y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y touches z (from EC(y,z)). 

Let's be even more concrete. Imagine y is a small disk inside a larger disk x, with y touching the boundary of x at a single point p. And z is a disk that touches y at a single point q on the boundary of y.

Now, the key is where q is. If q is not p, then q is inside x (not on the boundary of x). In this case, z can be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

But hold on, there's an issue here. If y is a proper part of x, then every point of y is a point of x. So if y touches z at the boundary, then x also touches z at that point. But does that mean z touches the boundary of x? Not necessarily. The point where y and z touch could be inside x, not on the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Alright, let's test all of our conclusions with concrete examples to make sure we haven't made any mistakes.

Let's set up a two-dimensional scenario. x, y, and z are disks in the plane.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This would mean y and z are also disconnected, which contradicts EC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping. This is possible if y is inside x, touches the boundary of x at a point p, and touches z at a point q, where q is on the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained within the other. This is possible if y is inside x, touches the boundary of x at a point p, and touches z at a point q, where z extends into x but also extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if y is inside x, touches the boundary of x at a point p, and touches z at a point q, where x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z at point p.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If y touches z at the boundary, and y is inside x, then x must also touch z at the boundary. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if y is inside x, touches the boundary of x at a point p, and touches z at a point q, where z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x at point q.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if y is inside x, touches the boundary of x at a point p, and touches z at a point q, where q is not on the boundary of x, and z is entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I think I'm still making a mistake. Let me think about EC(y,z) more carefully.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. So there's a point q that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z, but the interiors of y and z don't intersect.

Now, let me think about NTPPi(x,z) again.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

If y touches the boundary of x at a point p, and y touches z at a point q, can z be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x? Yes, if q is not on the boundary of x.

Let's visualize this concretely. Imagine a disk x, with a smaller disk y inside it. The disk y touches the boundary of x at a point p. Now imagine a third disk z, which touches y at a point q on the boundary of y. But q is not p, so q is inside x, not on the boundary of x. In this case, z can be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

So the possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me think about the EC(x,z) case more carefully.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping. If y is inside x, touches the boundary of x at a point p, and touches z at a point q, then for EC(x,z) to be true, q must be on the boundary of x.

But if q is on the boundary of x, and q is also on the boundary of z, then z touches the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z). So EC(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) cannot both be possible.

OK, I'm overthinking this. Let me try to make a clearer argument.

We know TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z). That means:

- y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

If y touches z at the boundary, and y is inside x, then x must also touch z. But does this touch have to be at the boundary of x? Not necessarily. The point where y and z touch could be inside x, not on the boundary of x.

If the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of x, then x and z touch at their boundaries, making EC(x,z) possible.

If the point where y and z touch is inside x, not on the boundary of x, then z could be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

So both EC(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible, but they can't both be true at the same time for a specific configuration.

In fact, all the relations we've identified are possible, but they can't all be true at the same time for a specific configuration. The possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, we need to be even more careful about NTPPi(x,z).

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

If y touches z at the boundary, and y touches the boundary of x, the question is whether z must also touch the boundary of x.

OK let me be even more concrete. Imagine a disk x, with a smaller disk y inside it. The disk y touches the boundary of x at a point p. Now imagine a third disk z, which touches y at a point q on the boundary of y. 

If q is p, then z also touches the boundary of x at p. In this case, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

If q is not p, then q is inside x, not on the boundary of x. In this case, z could be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

So both cases are possible. The possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I think I have it. Let me make one more attempt:

1. DC(x,z) is not possible. If y is part of x and y touches z, then x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) is possible. If the point where y touches z is on the boundary of x, then x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) is possible. If z extends into x, but also extends outside of x, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) is possible. If x is entirely contained within z, and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is true.

5. NTPP(x,z) is not possible. If y touches z at the boundary, and y is inside x, then x must also touch z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) is possible. If z is entirely contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) is true.

7. NTPPi(x,z) is possible. If the point where y touches z is inside x, not on the boundary of x, then z can be entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z) is not possible. If y is a proper part of x, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z.

So the possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK my final answer is that the possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given the stated conditions.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of x and y touches z, x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If z touches y only at the boundary, and that point of contact is on the boundary of x, then x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z could overlap partially, where some parts of z extend into x while other parts of z are outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be entirely contained within z while touching z's boundary at the point where y touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If y touches z at the boundary, and y is inside x, then x must also touch z, which contradicts the non-tangential requirement.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be entirely contained within x while touching x's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If the point where y touches z is not on the boundary of x, then z could be entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If y is a proper part of x and y only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot be the same as z.
