PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think this through step by step.

First, let me understand what each of these relations means.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Now I need to determine what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

We know that y is entirely contained within x (not touching x's boundary), and y is contained within z (touching z's boundary). 

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. 
   This is not possible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must have some overlap.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
   This is not possible because y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This could be possible. If y is in both x and z, but neither x nor z is contained in the other, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This could be possible. If x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary, then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This could be possible. If x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This could be possible. If z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is not possible because y touches z's boundary and y is entirely within x, so z must touch x's boundary if it's a proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident.
   This could be possible. If x and z are the same region, then they would be coincident.

Let me double-check my reasoning by considering specific scenarios:

- We know y is entirely contained within x (not touching x's boundary).
- We know y is contained within z (touching z's boundary).

Let's start with PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap. 
Can this be the case? Yes, imagine x is a larger region and z is another region that partially overlaps with x. The overlapping part includes y, and y touches the boundary of z but is inside x, not touching its boundary. This scenario satisfies our constraints.

What about TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z?
Can this be the case? Yes, imagine x is a region inside z, touching z's boundary. y is a region inside x, not touching x's boundary but touching z's boundary (at the same point where x touches z). This scenario satisfies our constraints.

What about NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
Can this be the case? Yes, imagine x is a region fully inside z, not touching z's boundary. y is a region inside x, not touching x's boundary but touching z's boundary. Wait, this is a contradiction because if y is inside x and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y can't touch z's boundary either. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me rethink this. If NTPPi(x,y), then y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z touching z's boundary. 

Can we have NTPP(x,z)? If x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would also be fully inside z without touching z's boundary. But this contradicts TPP(y,z), which says y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

What about TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x?
Can this be the case? If z is inside x touching x's boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, we need to check if this is consistent with NTPPi(x,y), which means y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary. But if y touches z's boundary and z touches x's boundary, it's possible for y to not touch x's boundary if the boundaries of z and x don't overlap at the point where y touches z. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

What about EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident?
Can this be the case? If x and z are the same region, then y would be inside both, touching the boundary of both. But this contradicts NTPPi(x,y), which says y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me approach this differently. I think I've been making some errors in my reasoning. Let me work through this more carefully.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

We want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This would mean that x and z have no points in common. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must have at least y in common. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but have no interior overlap.
   This would mean that x and z have only boundary points in common. But y is an interior part of both x and z, so x and z must have interior overlap. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This means that x and z have some parts in common, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. For example, y could be in the overlapping region, touching z's boundary but not x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means that x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. For example, x could be inside z, touching z's boundary, and y could be inside x, not touching x's boundary but touching z's boundary where x also touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means that x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. But if y is inside x and touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means that z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. For example, z could be inside x, touching x's boundary, and y could be inside z, touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means that z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary. This is not possible because if y touches z's boundary, and y does not touch x's boundary, then z's boundary cannot be x's boundary, which means z cannot be tangential to x. But if z is entirely within x and not tangential to x, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. 
   
   Wait, I'm making a mistake here. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, it means z is fully inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside z, touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This means that x and z are the same region. If y touches z's boundary but does not touch x's boundary, then x and z cannot have the same boundary, so they cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning, especially for the cases where I'm unsure:

For NTPP(x,z):
- NTPPi(x,y): y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary.

If x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would be fully inside z without touching z's boundary (by transitivity). But this contradicts TPP(y,z), which says y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- NTPPi(x,y): y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is fully inside x without touching x's boundary.

If z is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, is this consistent with y being fully inside x without touching x's boundary? Yes, it is. y can touch z's boundary while still being fully inside x, not touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of NTPP(x,z) once more, as I feel like I'm making a mistake.

NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary.

If x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, can y touch z's boundary?

No, that's not possible. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then any point inside x (including all of y) must be strictly in the interior of z, away from z's boundary. So if y is inside x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y cannot touch z's boundary. This contradicts TPP(y,z), which says y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Ok, so the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me do one final sanity check:

NTPPi(x,y) means y is fully inside x, not touching x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

For PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. y can be in the overlapping region, touching z's boundary but not x's boundary.

For TPP(x,z): x is inside z, touching z's boundary. This is possible. y can be inside x, not touching x's boundary but touching z's boundary where x also touches z.

For TPPi(x,z): z is inside x, touching x's boundary. This is possible. y can be inside z, touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z): z is fully inside x, not touching x's boundary. This is possible. y can be inside z, touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

I think these four relations are indeed the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, let me double-check TPPi(x,z) one more time.

TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x, touching x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is fully inside x, not touching x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

If z touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, can y not touch x's boundary? This depends on where exactly z touches x's boundary and where y touches z's boundary. If z touches x's boundary at a point p, and y touches z's boundary at a different point q, then y would not touch x's boundary. This scenario is consistent with our constraints. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given that NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's understand what these given relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is fully inside x, not touching x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Now I'll analyze all possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must overlap.

2. EC(x,z) - Impossible because y is in the interior of both, so they must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y in the shared region, touching z's boundary but not x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be inside z and touch z's boundary, with y inside x touching z's boundary at the same location x touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Impossible. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) couldn't touch z's boundary either, contradicting TPP(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, with y inside z touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, with y inside z touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Impossible. If x and z were identical, then y would have to touch x's boundary (since it touches z's boundary), contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
