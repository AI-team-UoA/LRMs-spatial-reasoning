PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider what we know:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and x touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and y does not touch z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's reason through this:

Given TPP(x,y), x is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary.
Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely contained in z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is contained in y, and y is contained in z, we know that x is also contained in z (the "part of" relation is transitive). 

But we need to determine whether x touches z's boundary or not to distinguish between TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Since y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, there's a "buffer zone" between x and z's boundary. This means x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me double-check this logic. 

TPP(x,y) means x touches y's boundary. NTPP(y,z) means y doesn't touch z's boundary. Can x touch z's boundary if x touches y's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary?

No, it's not possible. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), there's some space in z that's not part of y, which separates y from z's boundary. Since x is contained in y (TPP(x,y)), x is also separated from z's boundary by this space.

Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary, and the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to be a bit more careful here. Let's review the definitions:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and x touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and y does not touch z's boundary.

Now, TPP(x,y) means x touches y's boundary, but it doesn't specify which part of y's boundary x touches. 

Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. The boundary of y could be anywhere inside z.

So, if x touches y's boundary, can x also touch z's boundary? 

Let's consider this geometrically:
- y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary, x would need to extend outside of y, which contradicts TPP(x,y). Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I'm making an error in my reasoning. Let me think more carefully.

TPP(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Since x is part of y, and y is part of z, x is definitely part of z (transitivity of the "part of" relation). The question is whether x touches z's boundary.

Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), y is separated from z's boundary by some region in z. 

Let's say the boundary of y is B(y) and the boundary of z is B(z).

Given NTPP(y,z), we know B(y) does not intersect with B(z).

Now, TPP(x,y) means x is part of y and x touches B(y). But the fact that x touches B(y) doesn't tell us anything about x's relationship with B(z).

Since y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, any point on y's boundary is still inside z. If x touches y's boundary, x is still inside z.

So, x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, I need to be even more careful here. Let's use some basic principles of spatial reasoning.

1. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This implies that x is properly contained in y, and x touches the boundary of y.

2. NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This implies that y is properly contained in z, and y does not touch the boundary of z.

From 1 and 2, we can deduce that x is properly contained in z (because x is properly contained in y, and y is properly contained in z).

But can x touch the boundary of z? 

Given NTPP(y,z), there's a gap between y and the boundary of z. Since x is contained in y, x is also separated from the boundary of z by this gap.

Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z, which means the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to consider this even more carefully. Let's use a different approach.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y.
- x touches the boundary of y.

NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z.
- y does not touch the boundary of z.

From these, we can infer:
- x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x is a proper part of z (by transitivity).
- y does not touch the boundary of z, which means there's some non-empty region of z that is outside of y. Since x is a proper part of y, x is also separated from the boundary of z by this region.

Therefore, x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z, which means NTPP(x,z).

I think this is the correct analysis, but let me double-check with a concrete example:

Imagine z is a large square, y is a smaller square inside z without touching z's boundary, and x is an even smaller square inside y and touching y's boundary.

In this example, TPP(x,y) holds because x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. NTPP(y,z) holds because y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

What's the relationship between x and z in this example? Since x is inside y, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, x is inside z without touching z's boundary. This confirms NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'll try to be thorough and make sure we're not missing anything.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's check each of the RCC-8 relations to see if they're possible for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since x is part of y, and y is part of z, x is also part of z. So x and z share spatial parts. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But since x is part of y, and y is part of z, x is also part of z. So x and z share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. But we've established that x is part of z. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. We've established that x is part of z. But can x touch z's boundary? Given NTPP(y,z), y doesn't touch z's boundary, which means there's a gap between y and z's boundary. Since x is contained in y, x is also separated from z's boundary by this gap. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. We've established that x is part of z and can't touch z's boundary (as explained in the previous point). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of TPP, meaning z is part of x and touches x's boundary. But since y is part of z, and x is part of y, z cannot be part of x (this would create a circular containment, which is not possible). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. But as explained for TPPi, z cannot be part of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. But since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, x is smaller than z. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

From this exhaustive check, we confirm that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to be careful that I haven't made some error. Let me double-check this one more time.

We have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and x touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and y does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is a proper part of y (from TPP), and y is a proper part of z (from NTPP), by transitivity, x is a proper part of z.

The key question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means there's a "buffer zone" within z that's outside of y. Since x is contained in y, x is also surrounded by this buffer zone and can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I've been rushing to a conclusion. Let me take a step back and consider whether there's any way that TPP(x,z) could be possible.

TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, or x is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We know x is part of z (by transitivity from TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)). But can x touch z's boundary?

Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means there's some region in z that's outside of y and separates y from z's boundary.

Since x is contained in y (from TPP(x,y)), x is also separated from z's boundary by this region.

Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary, which means TPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Ok, I think I'm being consistent in my reasoning.

Let me make sure I understand the relationships by explaining them once more:

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y (x is completely contained in y) and x touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z (y is completely contained in z) and y does not touch z's boundary.

From these, we can deduce:
- x is a proper part of z (by transitivity).
- y is surrounded by a buffer zone in z, separating y from z's boundary.
- Since x is contained in y, x is also surrounded by this buffer zone and can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which is the definition of NTPP(x,z).

Based on my analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I want to reconsider. The fact that y doesn't touch the boundary of z means there's a gap. But what if x is so "long" that it extends from y's boundary all the way to z's boundary?

Wait, that's not possible. If x is a part of y, it can't extend beyond y's boundary. If x extended beyond y's boundary, it wouldn't be a part of y.

So, my previous reasoning is correct. The gap that exists between y and z's boundary also separates x from z's boundary because x is contained in y.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I want to make sure I've thought of all the possibilities.

Since TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we know that:
- x is properly part of y and touches y's boundary.
- y is properly part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

If x is properly part of y, and y is properly part of z, then x is properly part of z. That rules out several RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPPi, NTPPi).

So, the relationship between x and z is either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to touch z's boundary. But given NTPP(y,z), y doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y, there's a gap between x and z's boundary. This rules out TPP(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I am satisfied with this answer. Based on the given relationships TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me check if there's a different relationship I should consider.

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Could x touch the boundary of z? If x does, then TPP(x,z) would be a possible relationship.

But this is not possible. Given NTPP(y,z), y is contained in z with a gap between y and z's boundary. Since x is contained in y, x is also separated from z's boundary by this gap.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider using a specific example:

Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as an even smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.

In this example, TPP(x,y) holds because x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. NTPP(y,z) holds because y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

What's the relationship between x and z? x is inside z without touching z's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z).

This confirms the conclusion I've been reaching.

Based on my analysis, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relations tell us:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is part of y, and y is part of z, we know that x must be part of z (by transitivity of the part-of relation).

The key question is whether x can touch the boundary of z. Given NTPP(y,z), there's a gap between y and z's boundary. Since x is contained within y and cannot extend beyond y's boundaries (otherwise it wouldn't be a proper part of y), x cannot reach z's boundary.

Therefore, x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, which matches the definition of NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
