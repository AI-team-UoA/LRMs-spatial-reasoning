PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider what we know:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. This is the same as TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now I need to determine what relationship could hold between x and z.

First, let's visualize this. We have:
- x and y are disconnected (completely separate)
- z is a part of y and touches y's boundary

Since z is a part of y and x is disconnected from y, one possible relationship is that x is also disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is one possibility.

But I need to carefully consider if there are other possibilities. Since z touches y's boundary, and x is outside of y, could x possibly touch z at y's boundary? Let's think about this.

If z touches y's boundary, and x is completely outside of y, there could be a case where x touches the exact part of y's boundary that z touches. In this case, x and z would be externally connected. So EC(x,z) is another possibility.

What about the other relations?
- PO(x,z) would mean x and z partially overlap. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, this is not possible.
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, this is not possible.
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, this is not possible.
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since z is part of y, and x is disconnected from y, this is not possible.
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But since z is part of y, and x is disconnected from y, this is not possible.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is part of y, this is not possible.

Actually, let me think more carefully. We know that TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means TPP(z,y), or that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given that DC(x,y) means x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, I now think that x must be disconnected from z. So the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Actually I need to think about this more carefully.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. z is a proper part of y (all of z is inside y, and z is not equal to y)
2. z touches y's boundary (there's a point of z that is on the boundary of y)

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, so they don't share any parts and don't even touch at their boundaries.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is certainly possible. If x is disconnected from y, and z is completely inside y, then x could be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that z touches y's boundary, and x is outside of y, it's possible that x touches z exactly at the point where z touches y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is also a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since x is completely outside of y, and z is completely inside y, they can't overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since x is outside of y, and z is inside y, this isn't possible. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, since x is outside of y, and z is inside y, this isn't possible. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since z is inside y, and x is outside of y, this isn't possible. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, since z is inside y, and x is outside of y, this isn't possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since x is outside of y, and z is inside y, this isn't possible. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually I need to be more careful here. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Since x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), x and y don't share any part or boundary. Given that z is entirely within y (except for possibly touching y's boundary), the only points where x and z could potentially interact are at the boundary of y.

Let's reconsider:

1. DC(x,z): This is certainly possible. If x is disconnected from y, and z doesn't touch the part of y's boundary that's closest to x, then x would be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that z touches y's boundary, and x is outside of y, it's possible that x touches z exactly at the point where z touches y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is also a possibility.

No, wait, I need to think again. If TPPi(y,z), then z contains y as a tangential proper part. This means y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Let me redraw this:
- TPPi(y,z) means y is properly contained within z, touching z's boundary.
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected.

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

If y is a proper part of z (with y touching z's boundary), and x is disconnected from y, then:

1. x could be disconnected from z. This would happen if x is far enough from z. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. x could touch z's boundary but not y's boundary. This would be EC(x,z).

3. x could actually overlap with parts of z that are outside of y. This would be PO(x,z).

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This would be TPP(x,z).

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This would be NTPP(x,z).

6. It's not possible for z to be a part of x (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)) because z contains y, and x and y are disconnected.

7. It's also not possible for x and z to be coincident (EQ(x,z)) because z contains y, and x and y are disconnected.

So the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me revise again. I think I've been getting confused with the TPPi relation. Let's be very clear:

- TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which is the same as TPP(z,y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.

Given these, let's think about the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, then x is also disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that z touches y's boundary, and x is outside of y, it's possible that x touches z exactly at the point where z touches y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is also a possibility.

The other relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) would all require x and z to share some interior points or for one to be a part of the other. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, these relations are not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, wait. I've been reading TPPi(y,z) as TPP(z,y) which is not necessarily correct. Let me get this right:

TPPi(y,z) means that y is related to z in the same way as z is related to y in TPP. So TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means y properly contains z, and z touches y's boundary.

Given that, and DC(x,y) (x and y are disconnected), the relationship between x and z is:

1. If x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, then x is also disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. If x is disconnected from y, and z touches y's boundary, it's possible that x touches z exactly at the point where z touches y's boundary. However, this would mean x and y are externally connected, which contradicts the given DC(x,y). So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

So the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check the definition of TPPi. The "i" stands for "inverse", so TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). 

TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given TPPi(y,z) and DC(x,y), let's again think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, then x is disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Even though z touches y's boundary, and x is outside of y, if x were to touch z, it would be at a point on y's boundary. But this would mean x and y are externally connected, which contradicts the given DC(x,y). So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

So the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this one more time to make sure I'm not missing anything.

If TPPi(y,z), then TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y (contained within y) and z touches y's boundary.

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected.

Now, could x and z be externally connected (EC)? If z touches y's boundary, and x is outside of y, it seems like x could touch z at a point on y's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, then x and y would be externally connected, not disconnected. Since we're given DC(x,y), this means x doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, if x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z is inside y (touching y's boundary), then x can't touch z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me think about the definitions of TPP and TPPi once more.

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is properly contained within y, and x touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is properly contained within x, and y touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is properly contained within z, and y touches z's boundary.

Given:
- TPPi(y,z): y is properly contained within z, and y touches z's boundary.
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, they do not share any parts or boundary.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

If y is a proper part of z, and x is disconnected from y, then:
1. x could be disconnected from z. This would happen if x is far enough from z. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.
2. x could touch z's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary. This would be EC(x,z).
3. x could overlap with parts of z that are outside of y. This would be PO(x,z).
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z (in parts of z that don't overlap with y) and touches z's boundary. This would be TPP(x,z).
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z (in parts of z that don't overlap with y) and doesn't touch z's boundary. This would be NTPP(x,z).
6. It's not possible for z to be a part of x (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)) because z contains y, and x and y are disconnected.
7. It's also not possible for x and z to be coincident (EQ(x,z)) because z contains y, and x and y are disconnected.

So the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to draw this visually.

TPPi(y,z) means y is properly contained within z, touching z's boundary. Let's represent this as:
```
z: +-----------------+
   |                 |
   |   y: +------+   |
   |      |      |   |
   |      +------+   |
   |                 |
   +-----------------+
```

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected. 

One possibility is that x is also disconnected from z:
```
z: +-----------------+
   |                 |
   |   y: +------+   |     x: +---+
   |      |      |   |        |   |
   |      +------+   |        +---+
   |                 |
   +-----------------+
```
In this case, DC(x,z) is the relationship.

Another possibility is that x touches z's boundary:
```
z: +-----------------+
   |                 |  x: +---+
   |   y: +------+   |     |   |
   |      |      |   |     +---+
   |      +------+   |
   |                 |
   +-----------------+
```
In this case, EC(x,z) is the relationship.

Another possibility is that x overlaps with z but not with y:
```
z: +------------------+
   |                  |
   |   y: +------+    |
   |      |      |    |
   |      +------+    |
   |                  |
   |   +---+          |
   |   |   |          |
   +---+---+----------+
       |   |
       +---+
        x
```
In this case, PO(x,z) is the relationship.

Another possibility is that x is a tangential proper part of z but doesn't overlap with y:
```
z: +------------------+
   |                  |
   |   y: +------+    |
   |      |      |    |
   |      +------+    |
   |                  |
   |   +---+          |
   |   |   |          |
   +---+---+----------+
       
        x
```
In this case, TPP(x,z) is the relationship.

Another possibility is that x is a non-tangential proper part of z but doesn't overlap with y:
```
z: +------------------+
   |                  |
   |   y: +------+    |
   |      |      |    |
   |      +------+    |
   |                  |
   |   +---+          |
   |   | x |          |
   |   +---+          |
   |                  |
   +------------------+
```
In this case, NTPP(x,z) is the relationship.

It's not possible for z to be a part of x (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)) because z contains y, and x and y are disconnected.

It's also not possible for x and z to be coincident (EQ(x,z)) because z contains y, and x and y are disconnected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me check if I'm getting confused again. Here's how I'm interpreting the relations:

- TPPi(y,z) means that TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is a proper subset of y and touches y's boundary).
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected; they don't share any points.

Let's think about this carefully. If z is a proper part of y, and x is disconnected from y, then x must be disconnected from z as well. So, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

But I think I've been going back and forth about the meaning of TPPi. Let me make sure once more.

- TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. This means a is properly contained within b, and a touches b's boundary.
- TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b), which means TPP(b,a). So TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. This means b is properly contained within a, and b touches a's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained within y, and z touches y's boundary.

Ok, so TPPi(y,z) indeed means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Given that DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected (they don't share any points), and z is inside y, x and z must also be disconnected. So the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

To be sure, let me check all the other potential relations:
- EC(x,z): Not possible because if x and z touch, that point of contact would also be a point of contact between x and y (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- PO(x,z): Not possible because if x and z overlap, that overlapping region would also be a region where x and y overlap (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- TPP(x,z): Not possible because if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z, which means x is also inside y (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible because if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z, which means x is also inside y (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because if z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x, which means at least part of y is inside x (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible because if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x, which means at least part of y is inside x (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x and z are the same, and z is inside y, then x is inside y, which would contradict DC(x,y).

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, I'm revisiting the definition of TPP:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. a is inside b (a is a proper part of b) and a touches b's boundary.

TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b), which means TPP(b,a). So TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. This means b is properly contained within a, and b touches a's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is properly contained within y, and z touches y's boundary.

I'm confident now about the interpretation.

Given:
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected.

Now, if z is inside y, and x is completely separate from y, then x is also completely separate from z. So the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check by going through all the other potential relations:
- EC(x,z): Not possible because if x touches z, then x would also touch y (since z is inside y touching y's boundary), which would make x and y externally connected, not disconnected.
- PO(x,z): Not possible because if x and z overlap, then x would also overlap with y (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- TPP(x,z): Not possible because if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z, which means x is also inside y (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible because if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z, which means x is also inside y (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because if z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x, which means part of y is inside x (since z is inside y touching y's boundary), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible because if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x, which means part of y is inside x (since z is inside y), which would contradict DC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x and z are the same, and z is inside y, then x is inside y, which would contradict DC(x,y).

So, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

Alright, I'm convinced now. The answer is: DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no spatial parts)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means the same as TPP(z,y)

Since TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), this tells us that z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given that x is disconnected from y (they share no parts), and z is completely contained within y, x must also be disconnected from z.

Let me verify this is the only possibility:
- EC(x,z) is not possible because if x touched z, then x would also touch y (since z touches y's boundary), contradicting DC(x,y)
- All other relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) would require x to share some part with z, which would mean x shares some part with y, contradicting DC(x,y)

### Answer: DC(x,z)
