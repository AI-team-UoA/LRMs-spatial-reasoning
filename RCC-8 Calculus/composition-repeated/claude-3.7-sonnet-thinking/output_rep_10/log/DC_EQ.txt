PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step by step.

Given:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the exact same space.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), this means that y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent. They occupy exactly the same space. So any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that DC(x,y), meaning x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts, and given that y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x and z must also be disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning. 

If y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), then any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Since the relation between x and y is DC, the relation between x and z must also be DC.

So, the answer is: DC(x,z).

Wait, let me think again. I'm using the fact that EQ is an equivalence relation, which means that if EQ(y,z), then y and z are interchangeable in any spatial relation. Since DC(x,y), and y and z are interchangeable (due to EQ(y,z)), it follows that DC(x,z).

Let me verify this by thinking about it in terms of set theory:
- If DC(x,y), then x and y are disjoint sets.
- If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same set.
- If y and z are the same set, and x and y are disjoint, then x and z must also be disjoint.

This confirms that the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relation holds between x and z given the information provided.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent, they can be substituted for each other in any spatial relation. 

If x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and y is identical to z (EQ(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
