PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that:
1. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given that x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), x has exactly the same spatial extent as y. Therefore, if y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

To double-check this:

- DC(x,z) would mean x and z are disconnected, but we know x is inside z because x = y and y is inside z. So DC is impossible.
- EC(x,z) would mean x touches the boundary of z without overlapping its interior, but we know x is inside z (not touching its boundary) because x = y and y is inside z. So EC is impossible.
- PO(x,z) would mean x and z partially overlap, but we know x is fully inside z because x = y and y is fully inside z. So PO is impossible.
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z (touching the boundary), but we know x is inside z and not touching its boundary because x = y and y is inside z and not touching its boundary. So TPP is impossible.
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which aligns with our understanding of the situation: x = y and y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPP is possible.
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, but we know z contains x (because x = y and z contains y). So TPPi is impossible.
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, but we know z contains x (because x = y and z contains y). So NTPPi is impossible.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident, but we know x is a proper part of z (because x = y and y is a proper part of z). So EQ is impossible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully, especially for the TPP relationship:

We know that:
1. EQ(x,y): x and y occupy exactly the same space.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, TPP(x,z) would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z, touching the boundary of z. But we know that x is exactly the same as y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching the boundary of z. Therefore, x can't be touching the boundary of z either, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I believe my initial reasoning was correct, and the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. The question asks for the possible relationships between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). I have identified NTPP(x,z) as the only possible relationship, but let me verify this once more.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), they have the exact same spatial extent. Any relationship that holds between y and any other region will also hold between x and that region. 

So, if NTPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z) as well.

I think the answer is simply: NTPP(x,z).

Let me be completely rigorous. Let's go through all the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): This would mean x and z have no points in common. But we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x is coincident with y. So x and z definitely have points in common. Hence, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) (Externally Connected): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. But we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained within z's interior. Since x is coincident with y, x is also completely contained within z's interior. Hence, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping): This would mean x and z share some points, but not all of x is within z, and not all of z is within x. However, we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning all of y is within z. Since x is coincident with y, all of x is also within z. So, not all of x is outside of z, which rules out partial overlap. Hence, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part): This would mean x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. But we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y does not touch the boundary of z. Since x is coincident with y, x also does not touch the boundary of z. Hence, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (Non-Tangential Proper Part): This would mean x is a proper part of z and x does not touch the boundary of z. We know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x is coincident with y. Therefore, x is also a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part): This would mean z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. But we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained within z. Since x is coincident with y, x is also completely contained within z. Thus, z cannot be a proper part of x. Hence, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part): This would mean z is a proper part of x and z does not touch the boundary of x. Again, we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained within z. Since x is coincident with y, x is also completely contained within z. Thus, z cannot be a proper part of x. Hence, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): This would mean x and z have the exact same spatial extent. But we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is strictly contained within z. Since x is coincident with y, x is also strictly contained within z. Thus, x and z cannot have the exact same spatial extent. Hence, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After considering all the possibilities, only NTPP(x,z) is viable. The answer to the question is: NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be absolutely certain. I need to ensure I haven't made a logical error.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): This means that x and y occupy the exact same spatial region.
- NTPP(y,z): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which implies that y is completely inside z (including its boundary).

From EQ(x,y), we can substitute x for y in any relationship. So, if NTPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let's once more check all the possible RCC-8 relations to be absolutely sure:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This isn't possible because we know x (which is the same as y) is a part of z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, touching only at their boundaries. This isn't possible because we know x (which is the same as y) is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This implies that a portion of x is outside z, which isn't the case because x (which is the same as y) is completely inside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is a part of z and touches z's boundary. This isn't possible because we know x (which is the same as y) is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning it doesn't touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is a part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This aligns with what we know about the relationship between y and z, and since x and y are coincident, this is the relationship between x and z as well.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know y (which is the same as x) is inside z, not the other way around.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But we know y (which is the same as x) is inside z, not the other way around.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This isn't possible because we know y (which is the same as x) is a proper part of z, not equal to z.

So, the only consistent relationship is NTPP(x,z).

I am confident that NTPP(x,z) is the correct and only answer.

But, as a check, let me be precise about the definitions of these relationships to make sure I understand them correctly:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected if they share no points.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected if they share at least one point on their boundaries but no interior points.
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap if they share some interior points, but not all.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y if x is a proper subset of y and x shares at least one point with the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y if x is a proper subset of y and x does not share any points with the boundary of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of TPP.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of NTPP.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal if they share exactly the same points.

Based on these definitions, given that EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), it follows that x shares exactly the same points as y, and y is a proper subset of z without sharing any boundary points. Therefore, x is also a proper subset of z without sharing any boundary points, making NTPP(x,z) the only valid relationship.

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let's define these RCC-8 relations more rigorously:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected if they have no points in common.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected if they have at least one boundary point in common but their interiors do not share any points.
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap if they have some, but not all, points in common, and both x and y have some points that are not in the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y if all of x is contained in y, x is not equal to y, and x shares at least one boundary point with y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y if all of x is contained in y, x is not equal to y, and x does not share any boundary points with y (meaning x is fully inside the interior of y).
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of TPP.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of NTPP.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal if they contain exactly the same points.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y contain exactly the same points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning all of y is contained in z, y is not equal to z, and y does not share any boundary points with z.

From EQ(x,y), we can substitute x for y in the NTPP relationship:
NTPP(y,z) becomes NTPP(x,z).

This means that all of x is contained in z, x is not equal to z, and x does not share any boundary points with z.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me check this against the definitions again:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z have no points in common. We know x is fully inside z, so this relation is not possible.
2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z share at least one boundary point but no interior points. We know x is fully inside the interior of z, so this relation is not possible.
3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share some, but not all, points, and both have some points the other doesn't. We know all of x is inside z, so this relation is not possible.
4. TPP(x,z): This would mean all of x is inside z, x is not equal to z, and x shares at least one boundary point with z. We know x doesn't share any boundary points with z (as y doesn't, and x = y), so this relation is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean all of x is inside z, x is not equal to z, and x doesn't share any boundary points with z. This aligns with our understanding, so this relation is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean all of z is inside x, z is not equal to x, and z shares at least one boundary point with x. We know x is inside z, not the other way around, so this relation is not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean all of z is inside x, z is not equal to x, and z doesn't share any boundary points with x. We know x is inside z, not the other way around, so this relation is not possible.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z contain exactly the same points. We know x is a proper subset of z, so this relation is not possible.

After checking all the relations, I confirm that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

Therefore, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Let me actually try to be even clearer with these definitions. 

In RCC-8, the "connection" relation C is primitive, and the 8 possible relations between regions x and y are defined in terms of C:

1. DC(x,y): Not C(x,y) - x and y are not connected.
2. EC(x,y): C(x,y) and not O(x,y) - x and y are connected, but do not overlap.
3. PO(x,y): O(x,y) and not P(x,y) and not P(y,x) - x and y overlap, but neither is a part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): P(x,y) and not PP(x,y) and C(x, complement(y)) - x is a tangential proper part of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): PP(x,y) and not C(x, complement(y)) - x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): TPP(y,x) - y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): NTPP(y,x) - y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): P(x,y) and P(y,x) - x and y are equal.

Where:
- C(x,y) means x and y are connected (they share at least one point).
- O(x,y) means x and y overlap (they share at least one interior point).
- P(x,y) means x is a part of y (all points of x are also points of y).
- PP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y (P(x,y) and not P(y,x)).
- complement(y) is everything that is not y.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): P(x,y) and P(y,x), meaning x and y are equal.
- NTPP(y,z): PP(y,z) and not C(y, complement(z)), meaning y is a proper part of z and y does not connect with the complement of z.

From EQ(x,y), we have P(x,y) and P(y,x). 
From NTPP(y,z), we have PP(y,z) and not C(y, complement(z)).

Since P(x,y) and PP(y,z), by transitivity, we have P(x,z).
Since P(y,x) and not C(y, complement(z)), by substitution, we have not C(x, complement(z)).
Since P(y,x) and P(x,y), by definition, x and y contain the same points, so x is not equal to z (because y is not equal to z).
Therefore, PP(x,z) and not C(x, complement(z)), which by definition is NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

To be absolutely sure, let's check each of the RCC-8 relations systematically:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean not C(x,z), but we've established P(x,z), which implies C(x,z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.
2. EC(x,z): This would mean C(x,z) and not O(x,z), but P(x,z) implies O(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.
3. PO(x,z): This would mean O(x,z) and not P(x,z) and not P(z,x), but we've established P(x,z). So, PO(x,z) is not possible.
4. TPP(x,z): This would mean P(x,z) and not P(z,x) and C(x, complement(z)), but we've established not C(x, complement(z)). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean PP(x,z) and not C(x, complement(z)), which aligns with our reasoning. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean P(z,x) and not P(x,z) and C(z, complement(x)), but we've established P(x,z) and not P(z,x). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean PP(z,x) and not C(z, complement(x)), but we've established P(x,z) and not P(z,x). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean P(x,z) and P(z,x), but we've established P(x,z) and not P(z,x). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After a thorough check, I'm confident that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

Therefore, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Let me triple check one more time, as I realize I might be overcomplicating the reasoning.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), x has the exact same spatial extent as y. Therefore, any relationship that y has with z, x will have the same relationship with z.

Since y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), and x is the same as y, x is also a non-tangential proper part of z. Thus, NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I'm absolutely certain this is the correct answer based on the given constraints.

Therefore, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the given relationships constrain the possible relation between x and z.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy exactly the same space. This means that any spatial relationship that y has with another region, x will have the same relationship with that region.

Therefore, if NTPP(y,z), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me verify by checking against all possible RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z): Not possible since x is inside z
- EC(x,z): Not possible since x doesn't touch z's boundary
- PO(x,z): Not possible since x is completely inside z
- TPP(x,z): Not possible since x doesn't touch z's boundary
- NTPP(x,z): Possible, as x is completely inside z without touching its boundary
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible since z is not inside x
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible since z is not inside x
- EQ(x,z): Not possible since x is a proper part of z

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
