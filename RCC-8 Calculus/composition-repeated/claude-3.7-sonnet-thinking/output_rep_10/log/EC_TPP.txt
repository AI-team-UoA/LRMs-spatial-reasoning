PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out what RCC-8 relation(s) can hold between x and z given that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's think about what these relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

So we have:
- x touches y at its boundary
- y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary

Now I need to determine what relation(s) can hold between x and z.

Let's analyze this systematically:

1. Can x be disconnected from z? (DC(x,z))
   If x only touches y at its boundary, and y is inside z but touches z's boundary, then it's possible that x doesn't touch z at all. This would happen if the point where x touches y is not where y touches z's boundary. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. Can x externally connect to z? (EC(x,z))
   If x touches y at exactly the point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z at its boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. Can x partially overlap z? (PO(x,z))
   If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, could x and z overlap? Yes, if part of x extends into z beyond the boundary point where it touches y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z? (TPP(x,z))
   If x touches y only at its boundary, can x be completely inside z? Yes, if x is positioned such that it's contained in z and touches z's boundary (possibly at the same point where it touches y). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? (NTPP(x,z))
   If x touches y at its boundary, and y touches z's boundary, can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary? This seems contradictory - if x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, it would seem that x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x? (TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x))
   This would mean z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is properly contained in z, and x only touches y at y's boundary. It doesn't seem possible for z to be contained in x in this scenario. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? (NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x))
   This would mean z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, with y properly contained in z and x only touching y at y's boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be contained in x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. Can x be equal to z? (EQ(x,z))
   If x equals z, then y would be properly contained in x. But we're given that EC(x,y), meaning x and y only touch at their boundaries. This contradicts y being properly contained in x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning for some of these cases:

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, how can x touch y which touches z's boundary? If y touches z's boundary at point p, and x touches y at point q, then q must be on y's boundary. If q is also on z's boundary, then x touches z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,z). If q is not on z's boundary, then x doesn't touch y at the point where y touches z, which is consistent with NTPP(x,z). But can x touch y elsewhere on y's boundary? Yes, since y can touch z's boundary at one point and touch x at another point on y's boundary. So actually, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Let me reconsider...

For NTPP(x,z):
We know EC(x,y), so x touches y only at their boundaries. We also know TPP(y,z), so y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. 

If NTPP(x,z) were true, then x would be properly contained in z without touching z's boundary. But we know x touches y at their boundaries, and y touches z's boundary. This doesn't necessarily mean x touches z's boundary, because x might touch y at a different part of y's boundary than where y touches z's boundary.

So it seems NTPP(x,z) is actually possible.

Actually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at their boundaries but doesn't overlap. Given TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x touches y only at their boundaries (EC(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), can x avoid touching z's boundary? Yes, if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that doesn't coincide with z's boundary. In that case, x would be completely inside z (because y is inside z) but wouldn't touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Let me reconsider the other cases as well:

For TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x):
This would mean z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. But we know TPP(y,z), meaning y is properly contained in z. This would place y completely inside x, contradicting EC(x,y) which says x and y only touch at their boundaries. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x):
This would mean z is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary. Again, with TPP(y,z), y would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, contradicting EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So to summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Let me do another check to make sure I haven't missed anything or made an error.

For DC(x,z):
If x and y touch at their boundaries (EC(x,y)), and y is part of z touching z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), can x and z be disconnected? If the point where x touches y is not where y touches z's boundary, then x could be outside of z entirely. So DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z):
If x touches y at the exact point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary without overlapping. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
If part of x extends into z beyond where it touches y, but part of x remains outside z, then x and z would partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary (possibly at the same point where it touches y), then TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (by touching y at a part of y's boundary that doesn't coincide with z's boundary), then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x):
If z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary, then y would be completely inside x (since TPP(y,z)), contradicting EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x):
If z is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary, then y would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, contradicting EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If x equals z, then y would be properly contained in x, contradicting EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think one more time about NTPP(x,z). I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct.

For NTPP(x,z):
We know EC(x,y), so x touches y only at their boundaries. We also know TPP(y,z), so y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

If NTPP(x,z) were true, then x would be properly contained in z without touching z's boundary. Can this be consistent with EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z)?

If x touches y at their boundaries, and y touches z's boundary, would x necessarily touch z's boundary? Not necessarily. X could touch y at a part of y's boundary that's inside z, not where y touches z's boundary.

So yes, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

One more check on my work for these five relations: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me think about this in terms of regions and their boundaries.

If we have EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then:
- x and y share some boundary points but no interior points
- y is properly contained in z and shares some boundary points with z

For DC(x,z):
This means x and z share no points at all. Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's inside z (not where y touches z's boundary), and x is otherwise outside of z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z):
This means x and z share some boundary points but no interior points. Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at a point where y also touches z's boundary, or if x independently touches z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Is this possible? Yes, if part of x extends into z (beyond where it touches y) but part remains outside. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
This means x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, if x is inside z and touches z's boundary (possibly through the same point where it touches y). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
This means x is properly contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's strictly inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait a moment. I'm a bit uncertain about my reasoning for DC(x,z). Let me reconsider:

If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x touches y at their boundaries, and y is properly contained in z touching z's boundary.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z would have to share no points at all. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, wouldn't x necessarily share at least that boundary point with z?

Not necessarily. The point where x touches y could be on a part of y's boundary that's strictly inside z, not where y touches z's boundary. In that case, x could be entirely outside of z, making DC(x,z) possible.

So yes, DC(x,z) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z given that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let me understand what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPP(y,z): y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary

Now I'll analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's inside z, while x itself remains completely outside of z.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible if x touches y at a point where y also touches z's boundary, allowing x to touch z's boundary without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible if part of x extends into z beyond where it touches y, but part of x remains outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary (possibly at the same point where it touches y).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible if x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary (by touching y at a part of y's boundary that's strictly inside z).

The inverse relations (TPPi, NTPPi) are not possible because they would place y inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). Similarly, EQ(x,z) is impossible as it would mean y is inside x.
