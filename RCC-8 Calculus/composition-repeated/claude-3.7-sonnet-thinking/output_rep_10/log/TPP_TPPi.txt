PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the two given conditions:

1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is contained in y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, inverted. This means z is contained in y and touches y's boundary.

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations could hold between x and z.

Let me think about the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since x is inside y and z is inside y, this can't be the case. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since x is inside y and z is inside y, and both touch the boundary of y, it's possible that x and z touch at a point on the boundary of y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I made a mistake above. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which is the same as TPP(z,y). So z is not inside y; rather, y is inside z and touches z's boundary. Let me re-evaluate.

1. TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

But wait, this seems inconsistent. If y is a proper part of z (from TPPi(y,z)), then z can't be a proper part of y. Let me reconsider.

Actually, I've been misinterpreting TPPi. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (not the other way around). So:

1. TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

If x is inside y, and y is inside z, then x is inside z. Now we need to determine if x touches the boundary of z.

If x touches the boundary of y at a point p, and y touches the boundary of z at a point q, then we need to determine if p = q. If p = q, then x would touch the boundary of z, making the relation TPP(x,z). If p ≠ q, then x would be completely inside z without touching its boundary, making the relation NTPP(x,z).

However, the problem statement doesn't provide enough information to determine whether p = q. So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I need to think more carefully.

- TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Since x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, it's possible that x touches the boundary of z if both x and y touch the same part of the boundary of z. But it's also possible that x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
2. NTPP(x,z): x is inside z but does not touch z's boundary.

But let's examine this more closely. If x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, does this necessarily mean that x touches the boundary of z?

Let's imagine a scenario:
- z is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching the boundary of z at a point q.
- x is an even smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y at a point p.

If p is not the same as q, then x does not touch the boundary of z, making the relation NTPP(x,z). However, if p is the same as q, then x touches the boundary of z, making the relation TPP(x,z).

Actually, this isn't quite right. The points p and q are on the boundaries of y and z, respectively. If p is the point where x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z at q, then p and q are not the same point. So, x doesn't touch the boundary of z through the point where y touches the boundary of z.

But there's another possibility: what if x touches the boundary of y at a point p, and p is also a point on the boundary of z? This could happen because y touches the boundary of z, so there's a part of y's boundary that coincides with z's boundary.

Actually, I'm thinking of this too geometrically. Let's think of it more abstractly in terms of the RCC-8 relations.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. 
TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. 

If x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z. But is it tangential? That's the question.

For x to be tangential to z, there should be a boundary point of x that is also a boundary point of z. 

From TPP(x,y), we know that x has a boundary point that is also a boundary point of y. From TPPi(y,z), we know that y has a boundary point that is also a boundary point of z.

However, the boundary point where x touches y may not be the same as the boundary point where y touches z. If they are the same, then x also touches the boundary of z, making TPP(x,z) true. If they are different, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z, making NTPP(x,z) true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I should be more careful. Let's consider a concrete example. Imagine three concentric circles A, B, and C with increasing radii. So, A is inside B which is inside C. Now, let's say x corresponds to A, y to B, and z to C. We have TPP(x,y) since x is tangential to y, and TPPi(y,z) since y is tangential to z. But x is not tangential to z; x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So in this case, NTPP(x,z) holds, not TPP(x,z).

Hmm, wait a second. I'm thinking of the circles as physical objects where the interiors are the "things" and the boundaries are the "tangential parts." That's not right for this reasoning.

Let me use a clearer example. Consider three regions A, B, and C on a plane. If A is inside B and touches B's boundary, and B is inside C and touches C's boundary, what's the relationship between A and C?

A is inside C (since A is inside B and B is inside C). But does A touch the boundary of C?

If A touches B's boundary at a point p, and B touches C's boundary at a point q, and p ≠ q, then A doesn't touch C's boundary, making the relation NTPP(A,C). If p = q, then A touches C's boundary, making the relation TPP(A,C).

From the constraints of the problem, we can't say for sure whether p = q or not. So, both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible.

But I'm a bit unsure now about my interpretation of "touching". Let me try to be more precise:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and shares at least one point with the boundary of y.
TPPi(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and shares at least one point with the boundary of z.

Now, if x shares a point p with the boundary of y, and y shares a point q with the boundary of z, then x is a proper part of z (since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z). But does x share a point with the boundary of z?

It's not necessarily the case. Just because x touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of z, doesn't mean x touches the boundary of z. The boundary of y can include points that are not on the boundary of z, and the boundary of z can include points that are not on the boundary of y.

So, the possible relations are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

But actually, I think I was overthinking this. Let's try a clearer approach.

1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is properly contained in y (x ⊂ y) and shares at least one point with the boundary of y.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is properly contained in z (y ⊂ z) and shares at least one point with the boundary of z.

From these, we can deduce that x is properly contained in z (x ⊂ z) by the transitive property. 

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- If x shares at least one point with the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z).
- If x doesn't share any point with the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z).

But from the given information, can we determine whether x shares a point with the boundary of z? Not definitively. It's possible that the point where x touches the boundary of y is also on the boundary of z, but it's also possible that it's not.

For example, consider three regions X, Y, and Z on a plane such that X is a small circle inside a larger circle Y, and Y is inside an even larger circle Z. X touches Y's boundary at the east, and Y touches Z's boundary at the north. In this case, X doesn't touch Z's boundary, so NTPP(X,Z).

But, if X touches Y's boundary at the north, and Y touches Z's boundary also at the north, then X touches Z's boundary as well, so TPP(X,Z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, now I realize there might be another possibility.

Let's consider the relation PO(x,z), which means x and z overlap but neither is a part of the other. Is this possible?

TPP(x,y) implies that x is a proper part of y. TPPi(y,z) implies that y is a proper part of z. By transitivity, x is a proper part of z. This means that x is completely inside z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

What about DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)? Both of these imply that x and z have no common interior, which contradicts our finding that x is a proper part of z. So, DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible.

What about TPPi(x,z)? This would mean that z is a proper part of x, which is not possible if x is a proper part of z. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible because it would also imply that z is a proper part of x.

What about EQ(x,z)? This would mean that x and z are the same region, which isn't possible if x is a proper part of z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after considering all the RCC-8 relations, the only possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check our reasoning by considering some examples:

Example 1:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at the north.
- x is an even smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at the east.

In this case, x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z).

Example 2:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at the north.
- x is an even smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at the north.

In this case, x is inside z and touches z's boundary at the north, so TPP(x,z).

It seems both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible, depending on the specific configurations of x, y, and z.

Actually, let me be more careful. I've been thinking geometrically, but I should be thinking in terms of the RCC-8 spatial relations.

TPP(x,y) means that:
- x is a proper part of y.
- The closures of x and y have a common point.

TPPi(y,z) means that:
- y is a proper part of z.
- The closures of y and z have a common point.

From these, we can deduce that x is a proper part of z (by transitivity). But do the closures of x and z have a common point? Not necessarily.

If the common point between the closures of x and y is also a common point between the closures of y and z, then the closures of x and z have a common point, making TPP(x,z) true. Otherwise, x is a proper part of z but the closures of x and z don't have a common point, making NTPP(x,z) true.

So, both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible relations between x and z.

Actually, I think I've been making things more complicated than necessary. Let's simplify and be precise. From the RCC-8 spatial relations:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., x is a proper part of y and they touch).
TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is a proper part of z and they touch).

From these, we can deduce:
1. x is a proper part of z (since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z).
2. Does x touch the boundary of z? This is the key question to distinguish between TPP and NTPP.

Given just TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we can't be sure whether x touches the boundary of z. It might or it might not, depending on the specific spatial arrangement.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (if x touches the boundary of z).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (if x doesn't touch the boundary of z).

Ok, so I believe my final answer here is that the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

From these facts:
1. Since x is part of y, and y is part of z, then x must be part of z (transitivity)
2. The key question is whether x touches the boundary of z

There are two possibilities:
- x could touch the boundary of z at the same point where y touches z (making it TPP(x,z))
- x could touch y's boundary at a point that is in the interior of z (making it NTPP(x,z))

No other RCC-8 relation is possible because x must be a proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
