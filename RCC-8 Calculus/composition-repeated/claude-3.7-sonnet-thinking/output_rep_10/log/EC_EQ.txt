PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about this systematically. We're given:
- EC(x,y) meaning x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- EQ(y,z) meaning y and z are coincident (i.e., they occupy exactly the same space).

Since y and z are coincident (EQ), they have the same boundary and the same interior. That means the relationship between x and y must be identical to the relationship between x and z.

Since x and y are externally connected (EC), meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts, the same must be true for x and z.

So the relationship between x and z must be EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:

1. EC(x,y) means x and y share some boundary points but no interior points.
2. EQ(y,z) means y and z share all their points (both boundary and interior).
3. Therefore, if a point is on the boundary of y, it's also on the boundary of z.
4. And if a point is in the interior of y, it's also in the interior of z.
5. Since x shares boundary points with y but no interior points, x must also share those same boundary points with z but no interior points.

This confirms that the relation between x and z is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relation EC(x,y) combined with EQ(y,z) affects the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent:
- z has exactly the same boundary as y
- z has exactly the same interior as y

Therefore, since x touches y's boundary but shares no interior with y, x must also:
- touch z's boundary (since it's the same boundary as y's)
- share no interior with z (since z's interior is identical to y's interior)

This precisely matches the definition of EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
