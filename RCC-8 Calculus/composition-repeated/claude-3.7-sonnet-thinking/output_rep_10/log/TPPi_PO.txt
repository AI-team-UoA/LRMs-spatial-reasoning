PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step-by-step.

Given information:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's understand what TPPi(x,y) means spatially. It means that y is properly contained in x, with y touching the boundary of x. In other words, x contains y as a proper part, and y touches the boundary of x.

Next, PO(y,z) means that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is contained within the other.

Given these two relations, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z (from PO(y,z)), this means that z has a part that overlaps with a part of x (specifically, the part that is y). 

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. **DC(x,z)** - Disconnected. Can x and z be disconnected? No, because y is part of x and y partially overlaps with z, so x and z must share at least the part that y and z share.

2. **EC(x,z)** - Externally connected. Can x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interiors? No, because y is part of x and y partially overlaps with z, so x and z must share interior parts.

3. **PO(x,z)** - Partially overlapping. Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, this is possible. x and z share the part where y and z overlap, but z can extend outside of x and x can contain parts that z doesn't.

4. **TPP(x,z)** - Tangential proper part. Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z extends beyond x in some areas and x touches the boundary of z.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** - Non-tangential proper part. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is properly contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if z completely engulfs x with some margin.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** - Inverse tangential proper part. Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** - Inverse non-tangential proper part. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is properly contained in x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is contained within x without touching the boundary of x.

8. **EQ(x,z)** - Equal. Can x and z be equal? This would mean x and z are coincident. This seems unlikely given the constraints, as y is a proper part of x and y partially overlaps with z, which suggests that z and x are different. However, I need to double-check this.

Let's reason more carefully, considering the constraints.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x that touches the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some part, but neither is contained within the other.

Since y is partially inside x (in fact, properly contained), and z overlaps with y but extends beyond y, z could have several relations with x.

1. z could partially overlap with x (PO(x,z)): This happens when z extends both inside and outside of x.
2. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z)): This happens when z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
3. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z)): This happens when z is contained within x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z) or TPPi(z,x)): This happens when x is contained within z and touches the boundary of z.
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z) or NTPPi(z,x)): This happens when x is contained within z but doesn't touch the boundary of z.

But is the equality relation possible? If x equals z, then TPPi(x,y) would mean TPPi(z,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. But we're given that PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap, and neither is part of the other. These two are contradictory. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think that the possible relations are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check each of these.

**PO(x,z)**: This is certainly possible. Consider a scenario where y is a proper part of x (touching x's boundary), and z overlaps with a part of y but also extends both outside of y and outside of x.

**TPP(x,z)**: Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z? In other words, x is contained within z and touches the boundary of z. Let's think about this...

Given TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a proper part of x touching the boundary of x. Given PO(y,z), y and z overlap partially. 

If x is to be a tangential proper part of z, then x must be entirely within z and touch the boundary of z. But we know that y is a tangential proper part of x, so y touches the boundary of x. This means that y also touches the boundary of z at the same point where y touches the boundary of x (since x is a tangential proper part of z, the boundary points of x are also boundary points of z). 

But if y touches the boundary of z, it means that y extends to the boundary of z. However, the relation PO(y,z) suggests that y and z overlap partially, and neither is contained within the other. If y extends to the boundary of z, it suggests that y isn't completely within z. This seems contradictory.

Let me rethink this. If y is a tangential proper part of x, it means y is entirely within x but touches the boundary of x. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely within z but touches the boundary of z. 

Together, this means y is within x, which is within z. Since y touches the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, it's possible that the point where y touches the boundary of x is also the point where x touches the boundary of z. In other words, y touches the boundary of z at the same point.

But if y touches the boundary of z, can it still have a PO(y,z) relationship? PO(y,z) means y and z share some common part, but neither is a part of the other. If y touches the boundary of z, it's possible that y partially extends outside of z. In this scenario, y isn't a part of z, but they share a common part. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

**NTPP(x,z)**: Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z? In other words, x is contained within z but doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. Given PO(y,z), y and z overlap partially. 

If x is to be a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This would mean that the boundary of x is completely surrounded by the interior of z. 

Can this be consistent with PO(y,z)? If y is a tangential proper part of x, it touches the boundary of x. But the boundary of x is not the boundary of z (since x is a non-tangential proper part of z). So, y touching the boundary of x doesn't mean y touches the boundary of z. 

It's possible that the part of y that touches the boundary of x is within the interior of z. And another part of y might be outside of z entirely, satisfying the PO(y,z) relationship. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

**TPPi(x,z)**: Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x? In other words, z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.

Given TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. Given PO(y,z), y and z overlap partially, and neither is a part of the other. 

If z is to be a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x. But this seems inconsistent with PO(y,z), which says that y and z overlap partially and neither is a part of the other. If z is entirely within x, and y is entirely within x, then the only way for y and z to overlap without one being a part of the other is if they have a complex geometric relationship within x. But even in that case, if z touches the boundary of x, it's possible that the part of z touching the boundary doesn't overlap with y. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

**NTPPi(x,z)**: Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x? In other words, z is contained within x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Given TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x, so y touches the boundary of x. Given PO(y,z), y and z overlap partially, and neither is a part of the other. 

If z is to be a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means z is surrounded by the interior of x. 

Is this consistent with PO(y,z)? y touches the boundary of x, so part of y is near the boundary of x. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is in the interior of x. For PO(y,z) to hold, y and z must overlap partially, but neither is a part of the other. This is possible if z overlaps with the part of y that's in the interior of x, while y extends to the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, after my detailed analysis, I believe the possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) (Partial overlap)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)

But I feel like I might have overlooked something. Let's double-check once more.

Wait, let me try to reason with some examples to ensure my analysis is correct.

Example for PO(x,z):
- Imagine x as a circle.
- Imagine y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- Imagine z as a circle that overlaps with y, but z is not entirely contained within y or vice versa. z extends both inside and outside of x.
In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) holds since y is a tangential proper part of x. PO(y,z) holds since y and z overlap but neither is entirely within the other. And PO(x,z) holds since x and z overlap but neither is entirely within the other.

Example for TPP(x,z):
- Imagine x as a circle.
- Imagine y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- Imagine z as a larger circle that contains x, and x touches the boundary of z.
In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) holds since y is a tangential proper part of x. Can PO(y,z) hold? If y is entirely within x, and x is entirely within z, then y is entirely within z, which wouldn't allow for PO(y,z). So, I think TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me re-reason this. I'm getting confused.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely within x, and y touches the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is entirely within the other.

If y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and PO(y,z), then some part of y is at the boundary of x, and y overlaps with z. 

Let's consider if TPP(x,z) is possible. This would mean x is entirely within z, and x touches the boundary of z. But if y is entirely within x (from TPPi(x,y)), then y would also be entirely within z. This would contradict PO(y,z), which says y is not entirely within z.

So, I think TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's check NTPP(x,z). This would mean x is entirely within z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, if y is entirely within x, it would also be entirely within z, contradicting PO(y,z).

So, I think NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

Let's check TPPi(x,z). This would mean z is entirely within x, and z touches the boundary of x. This is consistent with PO(y,z) if z overlaps with y but extends to parts of x where y is not present, and z touches the boundary of x at a location where y is not present.

Let's check NTPPi(x,z). This would mean z is entirely within x, but z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with PO(y,z) if z overlaps with y but extends to parts of x where y is not present, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

And PO(x,z) is still possible as described earlier.

So, my revised list of possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) (Partial overlap)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)

Wait, let me double-check with specific examples again.

Example for PO(x,z):
- Imagine x as a larger circle.
- Imagine y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- Imagine z as a circle that partially overlaps with y, but extends both inside and outside of x.
In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) holds since y is a tangential proper part of x. PO(y,z) holds since y and z partially overlap. And PO(x,z) holds since x and z partially overlap.

Example for TPPi(x,z):
- Imagine x as a larger circle.
- Imagine y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- Imagine z as a circle that partially overlaps with y, is entirely within x, and touches the boundary of x at a location where y is not present.
In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) holds since y is a tangential proper part of x. PO(y,z) holds since y and z partially overlap. And TPPi(x,z) holds since z is a tangential proper part of x.

Example for NTPPi(x,z):
- Imagine x as a larger circle.
- Imagine y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- Imagine z as a circle that partially overlaps with y, is entirely within x, but doesn't touch the boundary of x.
In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) holds since y is a tangential proper part of x. PO(y,z) holds since y and z partially overlap. And NTPPi(x,z) holds since z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

But are there other possibilities? Let's think about what PO(y,z) really means. It means y and z share some common part, but neither is entirely within the other. Given TPPi(x,y), y is entirely within x. Given PO(y,z), some part of z is within y, and some part of z is outside of y. But the part of z that's outside of y could either be inside x or outside x. So, I'm re-thinking the impossibility of TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I'm misinterpreting something here. Let me once again think through this carefully. If TPPi(x,y), it means y is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I've been misinterpreting TPPi(x,y) this whole time. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). In other words, TPPi(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.

No wait, I just re-read the problem statement, and it says TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So my reasoning up until this point is correct.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

Let's reconsider if TPP(x,z) is possible. This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, or x is properly contained in z and touches the boundary of z. If y is contained in x and x is contained in z, then y is contained in z. But we're given that PO(y,z), which means y and z share some part, but neither is contained within the other. This contradicts the containment of y in z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) would mean x is properly contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. By the same reasoning as above, this would contradict PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) (Partial overlap)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)

Actually, let me check one more thing. Is EC(x,z) possible? EC(x,z) would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Given TPPi(x,y), y is properly contained in x. Given PO(y,z), y and z overlap. If y is within x and y overlaps with z, it means z and x share some interior part. This contradicts EC(x,z), which says x and z don't share interior parts. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, my final answer is:
- PO(x,z) (Partial overlap)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)

But let me briefly double-check if other relations might be possible.

Is DC(x,z) possible? DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. Given TPPi(x,y), y is within x. Given PO(y,z), y overlaps with z. If y is within x and y overlaps with z, then x and z share some common part. This contradicts DC(x,z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Is EQ(x,z) possible? EQ(x,z) means x and z are equal. Given TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. Given PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z. If x equals z, then y would be a tangential proper part of z. But PO(y,z) says y and z partially overlap, which contradicts y being a part of z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

With this, I've exhaustively checked all eight RCC-8 relations, and the possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) (Partial overlap)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I'll analyze what's possible between x and z given the two relations.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some common part, but neither is contained within the other.

Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible. Since y is part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share some part.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible. Since y is part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share interior parts, not just boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x and z can partially overlap if z extends both inside and outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Not possible. This would mean x is properly contained in z, but then y would also be properly contained in z, contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible. For the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x if z overlaps with y but is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be a non-tangential proper part of x if z overlaps with y but is entirely contained inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be a proper part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
