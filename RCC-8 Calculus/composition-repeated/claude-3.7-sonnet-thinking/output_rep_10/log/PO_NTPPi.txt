PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We have two given relationships:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, y properly contains z and z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary).

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since PO(x,y), x and y share some spatial part, but x also has parts outside of y, and y has parts outside of x.
Since NTPPi(y,z), z properly contains y, and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary).

So z contains y, and y partially overlaps with x. What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

Since z completely contains y, and y shares a part with x, z must share at least that same part with x. So z and x must at least overlap.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because we know x and y share a part, and y is contained in z, so x and z must share at least that part.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z only touch at their boundaries. This is impossible for the same reason as DC. We know x and z must share some interior parts (the parts that x shares with y).

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x could have parts outside of z, and z certainly has parts outside of x (since z contains all of y, and y has parts that x doesn't have).

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be completely contained in z, and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be completely contained in z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x. This is impossible. We know y is completely contained in z, and y has parts that x doesn't have (from PO(x,y)), so z must have parts that x doesn't have, which contradicts z being a part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are the same region. This is impossible. We know y is completely contained in z, and y has parts that x doesn't have (from PO(x,y)), so z must have parts that x doesn't have, which contradicts x and z being equal.

Actually, let me reconsider. I think I made a mistake in my analysis. I need to be more careful.

We know:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, y properly contains z and z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary).

Hmm, I think I got the meaning of NTPPi wrong. Let me double-check.

NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse of NTPP(y,z). And NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Actually, wait, that's not right either. Let me be super explicit. 

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.
NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse, so z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

But I think I've been interpreting it correctly. NTPPi(y,z) means that z is contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, y properly contains z and z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary).

Wait, that's still not consistent with my initial explanation. Let me double-check the definition of NTPPi.

NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse of NTPP(y,z). NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Ok, so NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, we have:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

Since PO(x,y), x and y share some spatial part, but x also has parts outside of y, and y has parts outside of x.
Since NTPPi(y,z), y completely contains z, and z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary).

So z is contained within y, and y partially overlaps with x. What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is contained within y, and y partially overlaps with x, there are a few possibilities:
- z could be completely outside the part of y that overlaps with x, which would make x and z disconnected (DC).
- z could be inside y but just touching the part of y that overlaps with x, which would make x and z externally connected (EC).
- z could partially overlap with the part of y that overlaps with x, which would make x and z partially overlapping (PO).
- z could be completely contained within the part of y that overlaps with x, which would make z a part of x. If z touches the boundary of the overlapping region, it would be TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z). If z doesn't touch the boundary of the overlapping region, it would be NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).
- z could exactly match the part of y that overlaps with x, which would make x and z equal (EQ) in the overlapping region.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful. PO(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, and neither is part of the other. Let's say the shared part is x∩y. NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. It doesn't tell us exactly where in y this part is.

If z is completely contained within x∩y, then z is a part of x, and the relation would be NTPP(z,x) or TPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z) or TPPi(x,z).

If z is partially within x∩y and partially in y\x (the part of y not in x), then x and z partially overlap (PO).

If z is completely contained within y\x, then x and z are disconnected (DC).

If z spans across the boundary of x∩y and y\x, but doesn't contain any part of x\y, then EC, PO, or TPP might be possible, depending on the exact configuration.

Actually, let me reconsider the problem again. We are told that we're dealing with the RCC-8 calculus, where the relations are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ. And I'm given that PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Actually, wait, I think I've been misinterpreting NTPPi. Let me double-check the definition.

The RCC-8 relations are:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap).
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Now, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Actually, there's still something wrong with my analysis. Let me be careful again.

We know:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - The inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, z properly contains y and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary).

Wait, there's still confusion here.

NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse of NTPP(y,z). NTPP(y,z) would mean y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Actually, I think the prompt gives me the exact definition: "NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)". So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, to reiterate:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
- EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y but doesn't extend into it.
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z partially extends into the region where x and y overlap.
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y.
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of this region.
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of this region.
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal. This isn't possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y.

Wait, I need to be more careful about TPPi and NTPPi.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This would be possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x (not the boundary of the overlapping region).

But since z is non-tangentially within y (doesn't touch y's boundary), and some parts of x are outside of y, z can't touch x's boundary without touching y's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) isn't possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would be possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Actually, I'm getting confused again. Let me reconsider.

We have:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, if we think about the possible relationships between x and z:

- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
- EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y (from the y side) but doesn't extend into it.
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z partially extends into the region where x and y overlap, but also has parts outside the overlap.
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y.
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x within y.
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of x within y.
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal. This isn't possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y.

Hmm, I need to be careful. In TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), I can't simply say "z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y" because not every part of z that's in y will necessarily be in the overlapping region of x and y. Some parts could be in y but outside of x.

Let me reconsider. A key constraint is that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. And x has a partial overlap with y.

- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
- EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches the boundary of x within y. 
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z partially extends into the region where x and y overlap, but also has parts outside the overlap.
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y.
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal. This isn't possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y.

Actually, let me revisit TPPi(x,z). For this to be true, z must be completely contained within x and touch x's boundary from the inside. But since z is also completely inside y, this would mean z touches the boundary of x inside y. This is still consistent with the constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let's double-check.

So, given that PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we're saying that y and x partially overlap, and z is fully contained inside y without touching y's boundary.

DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y from the y side. For instance, consider: 
- y is a large circle
- x is another circle that partially overlaps with y
- z is a small circle entirely inside y but only touching the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y. In this case, z doesn't touch y's boundary, and it externally connects with x.

Actually, wait, this is wrong. For EC(x,z), x and z must touch only at their boundaries. If z is entirely within y and z touches the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y from the y side, then x and z aren't touching at their boundaries, they're touching at their interiors. So EC(x,z) isn't possible.

Let me reconsider from first principles again.

We have:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

For the relationship between x and z, let's think through each possibility:

- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

- EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected. For this to be true, x and z must touch only at their boundaries. If z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x has parts outside of y, then the only way for x and z to touch at their boundaries is if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y from the y side. But in this case, the touch point is in the interior of both x and y, so it's not a boundary point of x. Therefore, EC(x,z) isn't possible.

Actually, I'm not sure that's right. Let's consider a more concrete example. Let's say:
- y is a large circle.
- x is another circle that partially overlaps with y.
- z is a small circle entirely inside y but touching the boundary between the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of x and y from the y side.

At the point where z touches the boundary of the overlapping region, z is touching a boundary point of x, not an interior point. So EC(x,z) should be possible.

Actually, I should carefully review the definition of EC. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. So, their interiors are disconnected, but their boundaries touch.

Let's think about whether EC(x,z) is possible again. If z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, then z could touch the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y from the y side. This boundary point is on the boundary of x and the boundary of z, so they are touching at their boundaries. But they don't share any interior parts, because z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I'm still not getting this right.

Let's define the overlapping region of x and y as x∩y. And the boundary of this region as bd(x∩y). Alternatively, we can define the set difference y\x (the part of y not in x) and its boundary bd(y\x).

If z is entirely inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary, it can still touch bd(y\x) from the y\x side. At such a touching point, z is touching a boundary point of x from the outside. Hence, z and x are touching at their boundaries, making EC(x,z) possible.

- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z extends into the region where x and y overlap, but also has parts outside of x.

- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x must be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary from the inside. But since z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y, x can't be completely contained within z. So, TPP(x,z) isn't possible.

- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.

- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be completely contained within x and touch x's boundary from the inside. This is possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x from the inside.

Actually, I realize that this is a point of confusion. If z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z is also entirely inside x, then z can't touch x's boundary at points where x extends outside of y. But it can touch x's boundary at points where x's boundary is inside y, specifically at the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y from the x side.

- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This can happen if z is contained within the interior of the overlapping region of x and y.

- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal. Since z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y, x and z can't be equal.

Ok, let's restate. The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm not quite sure about EC(x,z). Let me double-check again. 

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at their boundaries, but their interiors must be disconnected. 

If z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, then z could touch the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y from the y side. This boundary point is on the boundary of x and the boundary of z, so they are touching at their boundaries. But they don't share any interior parts, because z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I was correct. Let's move forward.

Final check for each possibility:

- DC(x,z): Possible if z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
- EC(x,z): Possible if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y from the y side.
- PO(x,z): Possible if z extends into the region where x and y overlap, but also has parts outside of x.
- TPP(x,z): Not possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y.
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, to be more precise in my explanation about TPPi(x,z): We want the case where z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary from the inside. This is indeed possible in our setup. 

For example:
- Let's say the overlapping region of x and y (the x∩y region) extends all the way to the boundary of x in some parts.
- z can be placed entirely within this x∩y region, touching the boundary of x at points that are inside y.
- In this setup, z is a tangential proper part of x (touching x's boundary from the inside), and is also entirely inside y without touching y's boundary.

I think I need to recheck. From the constraints:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's go through each relation for x and z:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. For this to be true, x and z must touch only at their boundaries. If z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, then z could touch the boundary of x inside y. At such a touching point, z and x are touching at their boundaries, making EC(x,z) possible.

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z extends into the region where x and y overlap, but also has parts outside of x.

- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x must be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary from the inside. But since z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y, x can't be completely contained within z. So, TPP(x,z) isn't possible.

- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.

- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be completely contained within x and touch x's boundary from the inside. This is possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x from the inside.

- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This can happen if z is contained within the interior of the overlapping region of x and y.

- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. Since z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y, x and z can't be equal.

Actually, I think my final answer is:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Just to be sure, let me do a visual check:

Imagine:
- y is a large circle.
- x is another circle that partially overlaps with y.
- z is a small circle entirely inside y.

Now, let's check each relation:

- DC(x,z): If z is placed inside y but outside the overlapping region of x and y, then x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): If z is placed inside y such that it touches the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y from the y side, then x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): If z is placed such that it partially overlaps with the overlapping region of x and y, but also extends into the non-overlapping part of y, then x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): If z is placed entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x from the inside, then z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): If z is placed entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Alright, after careful consideration, my final answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are the possible relations between x and z.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if z is entirely within the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Possible if z touches the boundary between the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of x and y from the y side.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if z partially extends into the region where x and y overlap, but also has parts outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y, so x cannot be contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches the boundary of x from the inside.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is entirely within y, and x has parts outside of y, so x and z cannot be equal.
