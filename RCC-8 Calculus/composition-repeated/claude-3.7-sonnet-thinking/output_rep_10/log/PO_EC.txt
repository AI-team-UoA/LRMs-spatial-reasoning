PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected; they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's consider each of the 8 relations as a possibility:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. For example, imagine x overlapping with y on the left side of y, while z touches y on the right side of y. There's no shared part between x and z, so they're disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   This is possible. Imagine x overlapping with y but also extending to touch z at the boundary where y and z touch. In this case, x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. Imagine x overlapping with y and also extending to overlap with a part of z. In this case, x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. Imagine x being partly inside y and partly inside z, and it touches the boundary of z. This would make x a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. Imagine x being partly inside y but mostly inside z, and not touching the boundary of z. This would make x a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. Imagine z being partly inside y and partly inside x, and it touches the boundary of x. This would make z a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. Imagine z being partly touching y but mostly inside x, and not touching the boundary of x. This would make z a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This is not possible. If x and z were equal, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y. But we're given that z is externally connected to y, not partially overlapping. This is a contradiction.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check my reasoning, especially for TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

For TPP(x,z), I claimed that x can be partly inside y and partly inside z. But if x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x is fully contained in z, not just partly. I think I made an error here. Let me reconsider.

If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), can we have TPP(x,z)? 
In this case, x would be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But x also partially overlaps with y, which means part of x is inside y. Since y and z are only externally connected, they don't share interior points. So, if part of x is inside y, then that part of x can't be inside z. This contradicts the assumption that x is fully contained in z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, but x also partially overlaps with y, we get the same contradiction. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Now, for TPPi(x,z), we're saying z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But z is also externally connected to y. If z is completely inside x, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also overlap with y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), we're saying z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But again, this would mean z overlaps with y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I think my error was in visualizing the regions incorrectly. Let me revisit the remaining relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, then x and z could be completely separate from each other. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   If x partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, then x and z could touch at the boundary but not share interior points. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   If x partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, then x could extend beyond y and overlap with a part of z. This is possible.

Hmm, I think I need to be even more careful in my reasoning. Let's be more precise.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, let's consider each of the 8 relations carefully:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x overlaps with y in a region away from where y and z touch, then x and z would be disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   If x overlaps with y in a way that extends to the boundary where y and z touch, then x and z would be externally connected. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This one I'm now skeptical about. If y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points, how could x overlap with both y and z? If x partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, then x would need to cross the boundary of y to overlap with z. But this would mean x is not just partially overlapping with y; it's crossing the boundary of y. Let me reconsider.

   Actually, I think PO(x,z) is possible. Imagine x overlapping with y and then extending beyond y to also overlap with z. This doesn't violate the constraints that x partially overlaps with y and y is externally connected to z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But x also partially overlaps with y. Since y and z only touch at their boundaries, if x is inside z, it can't overlap with y. This is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But z is also externally connected to y. If z is inside x, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would overlap with y, not just be externally connected. This is a contradiction. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are equal, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y. But we're given that z is externally connected to y, not partially overlapping. This is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Hmm, let me reconsider PO(x,z) just to make sure:

PO(x,z) means that x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
If EC(y,z), it means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
And if PO(x,y), it means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

So, x overlaps with y, and y touches z at the boundary. Can x also overlap with z?

If we visualize y and z as two regions that touch at their boundaries, and x as a region that overlaps with y, it's conceivable that x could extend beyond y's boundary (the one that touches z) and overlap with z as well. This would make x partially overlap with both y and z, without violating the constraint that y and z only touch at their boundaries.

So, PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Hence, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, I think I've been overthinking TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi. Let me try a simple visualization:

Imagine y as a circle.
Imagine z as another circle touching y at a point (EC(y,z)).
Imagine x as a shape that overlaps with y (PO(x,y)).

Can x be completely inside z and touch z's boundary (TPP(x,z))? 
If x is completely inside z, then it can't overlap with y because y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible because if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, it can't overlap with y.

Can z be completely inside x and touch x's boundary (TPPi(x,z))?
If z is completely inside x, then y (which is externally connected to z) would also overlap with x. But we're given that x partially overlaps with y, not that y is completely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similar reasoning applies to NTPPi(x,z).

Let me re-visualize the situation more carefully to ensure I'm considering all angles:

- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's consider a concrete example to help us reason better:

Imagine:
- y is a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. This means y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).
- x is a circle centered at (0,1) with radius 1.5. This means x and y overlap, with neither fully containing the other, satisfying PO(x,y).

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

The center of x is at (0,1), and its radius is 1.5.
The center of z is at (2,0), and its radius is 1.

The distance between the centers of x and z is sqrt((0-2)^2 + (1-0)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5) â‰ˆ 2.236.

The sum of the radii of x and z is 1.5 + 1 = 2.5.

Since the distance between the centers (2.236) is less than the sum of the radii (2.5), x and z overlap, which means PO(x,z).

But if we change the parameters a bit and make x's radius smaller, say 1, then the distance between the centers (2.236) would be greater than the sum of the radii (2). In this case, x and z would be disconnected, which means DC(x,z).

If we make x's radius equal to 1.236, then the distance between the centers (2.236) would be equal to the sum of the radii (1.236 + 1 = 2.236). In this case, x and z would touch at a single point, which means EC(x,z).

So, depending on the specific configuration, x and z could have relationships DC, EC, or PO. This matches our earlier conclusion.

Let me just check that all of these configurations still allow PO(x,y) and EC(y,z):

In all the above examples:
- y is a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1.
- y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).

For the PO(x,y) condition:
- In the first example, x is a circle centered at (0,1) with radius 1.5. The distance between the centers of x and y is 1, and the sum of the radii is 2.5. Since the distance is less than the sum of the radii, x and y overlap. But since 1 is also less than 1.5 - 1 (which is 0.5), neither fully contains the other. So, PO(x,y) is satisfied.
- In the second example, x is a circle centered at (0,1) with radius 1. The distance between the centers of x and y is 1, and the sum of the radii is 2. Since the distance is less than the sum of the radii, x and y overlap. And since 1 is not less than 1 - 1 (which is 0), neither fully contains the other. So, PO(x,y) is satisfied.
- In the third example, x is a circle centered at (0,1) with radius 1.236. The distance between the centers of x and y is 1, and the sum of the radii is 2.236. Since the distance is less than the sum of the radii, x and y overlap. And since 1 is not less than 1.236 - 1 (which is 0.236), neither fully contains the other. So, PO(x,y) is satisfied.

So, in all three examples, both PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are satisfied, and the relationship between x and z can be DC, EC, or PO.

Actually, let me check one more thing to make sure that TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are truly not possible. If I can find a counterexample for one of them, I'll need to adjust my answer.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Additionally, x should partially overlap with y.

If x is completely inside z, then it can't extend to overlap with y, since y and z only touch at their boundaries. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), the reasoning is similar.

For TPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Additionally, z should be externally connected to y.

If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would either be inside y (which contradicts EC(y,z)) or outside y but close to its boundary. But if z is outside y and close to its boundary, then z and y wouldn't be touching; they would be disconnected. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), the reasoning is similar.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y. But we're given that z is externally connected to y, not partially overlapping. This is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Hmm, let me try one more thing. Let me try to find specific examples for TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi just to be sure they're impossible.

Suppose we have:
- y is a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. This means y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).

Now, for TPP(x,z) to be true, x should be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Additionally, x should partially overlap with y.

But if x is completely inside z, it would be centered somewhere inside z (like (2.5, 0) with a radius less than 0.5). But then x would be completely separate from y, not overlapping with it. This contradicts PO(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

What about TPPi(x,z)? For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z should be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Additionally, z should be externally connected to y.

If z is completely inside x, then x would encompass both z and the boundary of z that touches y. But this means x would also encompass the boundary of y that touches z. This means x and y don't just partially overlap; x contains a part of y's boundary. This could still be consistent with PO(x,y), as long as there are parts of y not in x.

Hmm, but this doesn't seem right. If z is completely inside x and z touches the boundary of x, and z also touches the boundary of y, then x and y would share the point where z touches both boundaries. This means x and y are at least externally connected, but they could still be partially overlapping. So, TPPi(x,z) might be possible.

Let's visualize a more concrete example:
- y is a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. This means y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).
- x is a large circle or region that contains z and also overlaps with y.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z should be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. For PO(x,y) to be true, x and y should overlap but neither should be fully contained in the other.

I'm trying to mentally picture a configuration where both of these are true, but I'm having difficulty. If z touches the boundary of x, and z also touches the boundary of y, then x and y would at least share the point where z touches both boundaries. But for x and y to partially overlap, they need to share a region, not just a point.

I think I'll try a different approach and start with a configuration where TPPi(x,z) is true, and then see if PO(x,y) can also be true.

Imagine:
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1.
- x is a larger circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, satisfying TPPi(x,z).

Now, for PO(x,y) to be true, y should overlap with x but neither should be fully contained in the other. And for EC(y,z) to be true, y should touch z at a boundary point.

Let's place y as a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1. This means y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).

Now, let's check if PO(x,y) is true:
- The distance between the centers of x and y is 2.
- The sum of the radii of x and y is 2 + 1 = 3.
- Since the distance (2) is less than the sum of the radii (3), x and y overlap.
- For neither to be fully contained in the other, the distance between the centers should be greater than the absolute difference of the radii. The absolute difference is 2 - 1 = 1, and the distance is 2, so this condition is met.

So, PO(x,y) is true in this configuration. This means TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship between x and z given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me double-check this with a clearer visualization:

- y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).
- x is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, satisfying TPPi(x,z).

For PO(x,y) to be true, x and y should overlap but neither should be fully contained in the other. The distance between the centers of x and y is 2, and the sum of the radii is 3. Since 2 < 3, x and y overlap. The absolute difference of the radii is 1, and the distance is 2. Since 2 > 1, neither is fully contained in the other. So, PO(x,y) is true.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a valid possible relationship. Let me now check if NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

Imagine:
- y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).
- x is a larger circle centered at (2,0) with radius 3. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPPi(x,z).

For PO(x,y) to be true, x and y should overlap but neither should be fully contained in the other. The distance between the centers of x and y is 2, and the sum of the radii is 3 + 1 = 4. Since 2 < 4, x and y overlap. The absolute difference of the radii is 3 - 1 = 2, and the distance is 2. Since 2 = 2, y is not fully contained in x, but it's on the edge. I think it would be considered a tangential proper part rather than partial overlap. Let me adjust the radius of x to 2.5.

With x as a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2.5:
- The distance between the centers of x and y is 2.
- The sum of the radii is 2.5 + 1 = 3.5. Since 2 < 3.5, x and y overlap.
- The absolute difference of the radii is 2.5 - 1 = 1.5, and the distance is 2. Since 2 > 1.5, neither is fully contained in the other.

So, PO(x,y) is true with these parameters. And NTPPi(x,z) is also true since z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (the boundary of x is 2.5 units away from its center, while z extends only 1 unit from its center).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also a valid possible relationship.

Let me now check if TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) are possible.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Additionally, x should partially overlap with y.

If x is completely inside z, it would be centered somewhere inside z and have a radius less than the radius of z. But if x is inside z, and z is externally connected to y, then x can't overlap with y. This contradicts PO(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. Again, if x is inside z, and z is externally connected to y, then x can't overlap with y. This contradicts PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y. But we're given that z is externally connected to y, not partially overlapping. This is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think I should be even more careful. Let me reconsider the TPPi(x,z) case:

- y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).
- x is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, satisfying TPPi(x,z).

But wait, if x and z have the same center, and z touches the boundary of x, then z and x are not in a TPPi relationship; they are concentric circles with different radii. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z should be inside x and touch the boundary of x, but not necessarily have the same center.

Let me correct this:
- y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).
- x is a larger region that contains z, and z touches the boundary of x at some point.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z should be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Let's say x is a circle centered at (3,0) with radius 2. This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x at the point (3,0) - 2 = (1,0), which is the same point where y and z touch. In this case, x would also touch y at the point (1,0), making EC(x,y) true, not PO(x,y).

Hmm, let's adjust x's center slightly. Maybe x is a circle centered at (2.5, 0.5) with radius 1.5. This means z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x at the point (2 + 1, 0) = (3, 0). The distance from the center of x to this point is sqrt((2.5-3)^2 + (0.5-0)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.5) â‰ˆ 0.707, which is less than the radius of x (1.5). So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x in this configuration.

Ah, okay, I think the issue is that for z to be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)), z should touch the boundary of x from the inside. But if z is a circle with radius 1, and z touches the boundary of y at a single point (the point (1, 0)), then any region x that contains z and for which z touches the boundary of x, must also touch y at the same point. This means x and y would be at least externally connected, not partially overlapping.

So, let's adjust my conclusion:
TPPi(x,z) is not possible given the constraints PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me also re-evaluate NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z should be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. Additionally, z should be externally connected to y.

If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then there's a "buffer" region around z that's still inside x. This means that the point where z touches y is also inside x. This makes x and y overlap at least at that point, which is consistent with PO(x,y).

Actually, let's revisit this. If z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z touches the boundary of y at a single point, then x contains that point and potentially more of y. This makes x and y overlap, which is consistent with PO(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) does seem possible with the given constraints.

Let's summarize the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z):
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I'm still concerned about TPPi(x,z). Let's try one more specific visualization:
- y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z should be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Let's say x is an ellipse or an irregular shape that contains z, and z touches the boundary of x at some point other than (1,0). For instance, z might touch the boundary of x at the point (2,1).

Now, for PO(x,y) to be true, x and y should overlap but neither should be fully contained in the other. Since z is inside x and z touches y at the point (1,0), x and y must at least share the point (1,0). But for PO(x,y) to be true, they must share a region, not just a point.

Ok, let's take a slightly different approach. I'll try to visualize a specific configuration where TPPi(x,z) and PO(x,y) are both true, given EC(y,z).

- y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).

Instead of a circle, let's imagine x as a more complex shape. Let's say x is a shape that encompasses z and also extends to overlap with a portion of y. Specifically, x contains z fully, and z touches the boundary of x at some point (e.g., (3,0)), which satisfies TPPi(x,z). And x also extends to the left to overlap with a portion of y, which satisfies PO(x,y).

In this configuration, TPPi(x,z) and PO(x,y) can both be true, and EC(y,z) is already established.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a valid possible relationship.

Now let me re-check my list:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. (Possible)
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. (Possible)
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. (Possible)
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. (Not Possible, as it contradicts PO(x,y) given EC(y,z))
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. (Not Possible, as it contradicts PO(x,y) given EC(y,z))
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. (Possible)
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. (Possible)
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. (Not Possible, as it contradicts the combination of PO(x,y) and EC(y,z))

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me just confirm the TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) relations one more time.

For TPPi(x,z) with a visualization:
- y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).
- x is a shape that entirely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x at the point (3,0). Additionally, x extends to overlap with a portion of y. This configuration satisfies TPPi(x,z) and PO(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z) with a visualization:
- y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
- z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. y and z touch at the point (1,0), satisfying EC(y,z).
- x is a shape that entirely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Additionally, x extends to overlap with a portion of y. This configuration satisfies NTPPi(x,z) and PO(x,y).

With these visualizations, I'm confident in my conclusion.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between regions x and z, given that:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some part, but neither is contained in the other)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (touch at their boundaries only)

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   This is possible. If x overlaps with y in a region away from where y touches z, then x and z would have no connection.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected
   This is possible. If x overlaps with y and extends to touch z at its boundary, they would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is possible. x could overlap with y and also extend to overlap with part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   Not possible. If x were completely inside z, it couldn't also partially overlap with y since y and z only touch at their boundaries.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. x could contain z entirely with z touching x's boundary, while x also partially overlaps with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. x could contain z entirely without z touching x's boundary, while x also partially overlaps with y.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   Not possible. If x equals z, then x would be externally connected to y, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
