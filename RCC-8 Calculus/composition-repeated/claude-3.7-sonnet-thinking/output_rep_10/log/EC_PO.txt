PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this problem by considering what we know:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap - they share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z. Let me go through each possible relation and decide if it's possible given our constraints:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
This is certainly possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, x could be completely separate from z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
This is possible. x could touch y at a boundary point, and z could extend to that same boundary point without overlapping x.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
This is possible. Even though x and y only touch at boundaries, z could overlap with part of x while also overlapping with part of y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
This seems possible. x could touch y at the boundary, and z could properly contain x while also partially overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
This seems unlikely. If x is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, then z would have to contain part of y (at least the part touching x). But since PO(y,z), z doesn't contain all of y. I need to think if this creates a contradiction...

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) is possible. x could be completely inside z, and x could touch y at y's boundary, which could be contained within z. Then z could partially overlap with other parts of y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
This is possible. z could be properly inside x and touch x's boundary, while also partially overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
This seems possible. z could be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) while still partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are identical
This seems unlikely, because if x = z, then we would have EC(x,y) and PO(y,x), which are contradictory. If x externally connects to y, then y can't partially overlap with x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning for each of these:

DC(x,z): ✓ - If x touches only y's boundary and z overlaps with a different part of y, then x and z can be disconnected.

EC(x,z): ✓ - If x touches y's boundary at point p, and z also touches that same point p but otherwise doesn't overlap with x, then x and z externally connect.

PO(x,z): ✓ - z could overlap with part of x and also overlap with part of y.

TPP(x,z): ✓ - x could be properly contained in z, touching z's boundary, while z also partially overlaps with y.

NTPP(x,z): ✓ - x could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, while z partially overlaps with y. The fact that x touches y's boundary doesn't prevent this, as that boundary of y could be inside z.

TPPi(x,z): ✓ - z could be properly inside x, touching x's boundary, while also partially overlapping with y.

NTPPi(x,z): ✓ - z could be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y.

EQ(x,z): ✗ - If x = z, then we would have both EC(x,y) and PO(y,x), which is a contradiction.

Actually, I'm not sure about my reasoning for TPPi and NTPPi. Let me think through these more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. But if z is inside x, and PO(y,z), then y must overlap with the interior of x. This contradicts EC(x,y), which says x and y only touch at boundaries. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), if z is completely inside x and PO(y,z), then y must overlap with the interior of x, contradicting EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Let me re-examine the possibilities:

DC(x,z): ✓ - Possible, as explained above.
EC(x,z): ✓ - Possible, as explained above.
PO(x,z): ✓ - Possible, as explained above.
TPP(x,z): ✓ - Possible, as explained above.
NTPP(x,z): ✓ - Possible, as explained above.
TPPi(x,z): ✗ - Not possible, would contradict EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).
NTPPi(x,z): ✗ - Not possible, would contradict EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).
EQ(x,z): ✗ - Not possible, would contradict EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm having doubts about my analysis of NTPP(x,z). Let me reconsider.

NTPP(x,z) means that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For NTPP(x,z) to be true, this boundary point of y that x touches must be inside z. But is this consistent with PO(y,z)?

PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other. If a boundary point of y is inside z, this doesn't contradict PO(y,z), because a boundary point is not part of the interior. So I think NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, wait, I need to be more careful. If x touches y at y's boundary, and x is completely inside z (NTPP), then that boundary point of y must be inside z. But if that boundary point is inside z, is it still a boundary point of y? I think the answer is yes - it could be a boundary point of y with respect to some other region, not with respect to z.

Let me try to construct a concrete example:
- Imagine y as a large square
- x is a small circle that touches the perimeter of y
- z is a larger circle that completely contains x but also overlaps with part of the interior of y
In this case, we have EC(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

So I think NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me finalize the answer:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share interior parts, but neither contains the other.

Let me analyze each possible relation:

DC(x,z): POSSIBLE - x could touch y's boundary while z overlaps with a different part of y, keeping x and z disconnected.

EC(x,z): POSSIBLE - x and z could touch at a boundary point (possibly the same point where x touches y).

PO(x,z): POSSIBLE - z could overlap with part of x while also overlapping with part of y.

TPP(x,z): POSSIBLE - x could be properly contained in z, touching z's boundary, while z also partially overlaps with y.

NTPP(x,z): POSSIBLE - x could be completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), while z partially overlaps with y.

TPPi(x,z): IMPOSSIBLE - If z is a proper part of x, then part of y would need to be inside x (due to PO(y,z)), contradicting EC(x,y).

NTPPi(x,z): IMPOSSIBLE - Same reasoning as TPPi.

EQ(x,z): IMPOSSIBLE - If x=z, we would have both EC(x,y) and PO(x,y), which is contradictory.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
