PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's recall the definitions:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

So we have:
- x and y partially overlap (they share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other)
- y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think through this carefully:

Since PO(x,y), x and y share some region, but x also has parts outside of y, and y has parts outside of x.
Since TPP(y,z), y is completely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

So what does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

1. Since y is contained in z, the part of x that overlaps with y must also be contained in z. So x and z must at least share some part.

2. Since x has parts outside of y, these parts could be:
   a) Inside z (but not in y)
   b) Outside z completely
   c) Partly inside and partly outside z

3. Now let's consider the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

   - DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because we know x and z share at least the part that x shares with y.
   
   - EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. This is not possible because x and z share interior parts (the overlap with y).
   
   - PO(x,z): This means x and z share some part, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is possible if x has parts outside of z.
   
   - TPP(x,z): This means x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if all parts of x are inside z, and x touches the boundary of z.
   
   - NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if all parts of x are well inside z.
   
   - TPPi(x,z) or NTPP(x,z): These mean z is a proper part of x. These are not possible because we know y is contained in z, and x only partially overlaps with y, so x cannot contain all of z.
   
   - EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is not possible because x only partially overlaps with y, but y is contained in z, so x and z cannot be the same.

Let me verify the three possible relations I've identified:

PO(x,z): Since x shares parts with y which is inside z, x and z share parts. If x has parts outside of z, then neither is contained in the other, making PO(x,z) possible.

TPP(x,z): If all of x is contained within z and x touches the boundary of z, this relation is possible. Since y touches the boundary of z and x overlaps with y, it's possible that x touches the boundary of z through this overlap.

NTPP(x,z): If all of x is contained within z but x doesn't touch the boundary of z, this relation is possible. This could happen if the parts of x that overlap with y don't include the parts where y touches the boundary of z.

Actually, let me reconsider the TPP and NTPP cases more carefully.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since y touches z's boundary and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x touches z's boundary through this overlap. But it's also possible that the overlap between x and y doesn't include any points where y touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility, but not guaranteed.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if all of x is inside z but the parts of x don't touch z's boundary. Given the constraints, this is also a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me verify this by thinking about concrete examples:

Example 1 (PO): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and x as a circle that partially overlaps with y and extends outside of z. In this case, x and z partially overlap.

Example 2 (TPP): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and x as a circle completely inside z that overlaps with y and also touches z's boundary (perhaps at the same point where y touches z). In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z.

Example 3 (NTPP): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and x as a circle completely inside z that overlaps with y but doesn't extend all the way to z's boundary. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

These examples confirm that PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are all possible given the constraints PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Wait, I think I need to be a bit more careful. Let's also consider the possibility of x touching the boundary of z without overlapping with the boundary part of y.

Since PO(x,y), x has parts outside of y. If these parts touch the boundary of z, then x would touch the boundary of z even if the overlap between x and y doesn't include any boundary points. So TPP(x,z) remains a possibility.

I think I've covered all possibilities now. The possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z share parts, but neither is contained in the other
- TPP(x,z): x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary
- NTPP(x,z): x is completely contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary

Let me double-check for completeness:

- DC(x,z): Not possible because x must share at least some part with z (through y).
- EC(x,z): Not possible because x and z must share interior points (through the overlap with y).
- PO(x,z): Possible as discussed.
- TPP(x,z): Possible as discussed.
- NTPP(x,z): Possible as discussed.
- TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y, it's not possible for z to be contained within x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is not possible given the constraints.
- EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region, which is not possible given that x only partially overlaps with y, but y is contained in z.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

On second thought, am I sure about TPP(x,z)?

For TPP(x,z), x needs to be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary. From PO(x,y), we know that x has parts outside of y. These parts could be:
1. Inside z (but outside y)
2. Outside z

If any part of x is outside z, then TPP(x,z) is not possible. So for TPP(x,z) to be true, all parts of x that are outside y must be inside z, and x must touch the boundary of z.

Given that y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)), and x overlaps with y, it's possible that this overlap includes points where y touches the boundary of z. In this case, x would also touch the boundary of z. Alternatively, if x has parts outside of y that touch the boundary of z, then x would touch the boundary of z through these parts.

So TPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility, but it requires that all parts of x are contained within z and that x touches the boundary of z (either through its overlap with y or through its parts outside of y).

So I reaffirm my answer:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I need to think more about whether EC(x,z) is possible.

I previously said EC(x,z) is not possible because x and z must share interior points through the overlap with y. But let me reconsider:

EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

Given PO(x,y), x and y share interior parts. Given TPP(y,z), all of y (including its interior) is contained within z. So the interior parts that x shares with y are also interior parts of z. Therefore, x and z must share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So EC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me also reconsider DC(x,z) more carefully:

DC(x,z) means that x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Given PO(x,y), x and y share spatial parts. Given TPP(y,z), all of y is contained within z. So the parts that x shares with y are also parts of z. Therefore, x and z must share parts, which contradicts DC(x,z).

So DC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

I've now confirmed that the only possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me look again at EQ(x,z):

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be the same region. But from PO(x,y), we know that x is not contained within y (it has parts outside of y). And from TPP(y,z), we know that y is contained within z. If x and z were the same, then y would be contained within x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

And let me check TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) again:

For TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be contained within x. But from TPP(y,z), we know that y is contained within z. So if z were contained within x, then y would also be contained within x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are indeed not possible.

I've now thoroughly checked all eight RCC-8 relations, and confirmed that the only possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's actually double-check that EC(x,z) is not possible. For EC(x,z), x and z need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior. As established, x and z must share some interior points (via the overlap with y), so EC(x,z) is not possible.

Checking one more time: is PO(x,z) always possible?

From PO(x,y), we know that x has parts outside of y. If any of these parts are outside of z, then x would have parts outside of z. Combined with the fact that x shares interior points with z (via the overlap with y), this would make PO(x,z) true.

So PO(x,z) is possible if x has parts outside of z, which is not guaranteed by the given constraints but is certainly a possibility.

Is TPP(x,z) always possible?

From PO(x,y), we know that x has parts outside of y. If all of these parts are still within z, and if x touches the boundary of z (either via its overlap with y or via its parts outside of y), then TPP(x,z) would be true.

So TPP(x,z) is possible if all parts of x are contained within z and x touches the boundary of z, which is not guaranteed but is a possibility.

Is NTPP(x,z) always possible?

From PO(x,y), we know that x has parts outside of y. If all of these parts are well within z (not touching the boundary), and if the parts of x that overlap with y don't include any points where y touches the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) would be true.

So NTPP(x,z) is possible if all parts of x are well within z, which is not guaranteed but is a possibility.

I've confirmed that all three relations are possible depending on the exact relationship between x, y, and z within the constraints PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some part, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze the possible relationships:

1. First, we know that x shares some region with y (from PO(x,y))
2. We know that y is completely contained in z (from TPP(y,z))
3. Therefore, x and z must share at least the region that x shares with y

The possible relations:

- DC(x,z): Not possible - x and z must share parts (through y)
- EC(x,z): Not possible - x and z must share interior points (through y)
- PO(x,z): Possible - x can have parts outside z while sharing parts with z
- TPP(x,z): Possible - x could be entirely in z and touch z's boundary
- NTPP(x,z): Possible - x could be entirely in z without touching z's boundary
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible - z cannot be part of x since y is part of z but not part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - same reason as above
- EQ(x,z): Not possible - x only partially overlaps with y, but y is contained in z

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
