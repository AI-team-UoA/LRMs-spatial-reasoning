PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the constraints first:

1. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z (y is fully contained in z) and y does not touch z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine what possible relationships can exist between x and z given these constraints.

Let's think through this systematically:

Given that EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.
Given that NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

1. Can x be disconnected from z (DC(x,z))?
   No, because y touches x (EC(x,y)) and y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)). If x were disconnected from z, then y would also be disconnected from x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

2. Can x be externally connected to z (EC(x,z))?
   Yes, this is possible. x could touch z at its boundary, while y is completely inside z and touches x.

3. Can x partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))?
   Yes, this is possible. x could overlap with a portion of z, and where they overlap, y (or a part of y) could be located.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))?
   Yes, this is possible. x could be fully inside z and touch z's boundary, while y is fully inside both x and z.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))?
   No, this isn't possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But given that EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), if x were fully inside z away from its boundary, and y is fully inside z away from its boundary, then x and y can't be externally connected (they would either be disconnected or overlap).

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))?
   No, this isn't possible. If z were a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of x (because NTPP(y,z)). But this contradicts EC(x,y), which states that x and y only touch at their boundaries.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))?
   No, for similar reasons as TPPi(x,z).

8. Can x and z be coincident (EQ(x,z))?
   No, because if x and z were the same, and NTPP(y,z), then NTPP(y,x) would also hold. But this contradicts EC(x,y).

So, from the above analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)

But wait, actually I think I made a mistake on my first analysis. Let's think more carefully.

1. Can x be disconnected from z (DC(x,z))?
   No, because if y is fully inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then x must at least touch z (at a minimum). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. Can x be externally connected to z (EC(x,z))?
   Yes, this is possible. x could touch z at its boundary, while y is completely inside z and touches x at its boundary.

3. Can x partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))?
   Yes, this is possible. x could overlap with a portion of z, and where they overlap, y (or a part of y) could be located, and y could touch x's boundary from inside z.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))?
   Yes, this is possible. x could be fully inside z and touch z's boundary, while y is fully inside both x and z, and y touches x's boundary.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))?
   No, this isn't possible. If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then x must touch y, which means x can't be completely inside z away from its boundary.

Wait, I'm not sure the above is correct. Let me reconsider this case:
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries. Since NTPP(y,z), y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. It seems possible for x and y to touch at their boundaries while both being fully inside z without touching z's boundary.

Actually, no, I think I was right the first time. If x and y touch at their boundaries (EC(x,y)), and y is fully inside z away from z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), then x can't be fully inside z away from its boundary (NTPP(x,z)) because then x and y would have to overlap, not just touch.

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))?
   No, this isn't possible. If z were a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of x (because NTPP(y,z)). But this contradicts EC(x,y), which states that x and y only touch at their boundaries.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))?
   No, for similar reasons as TPPi(x,z).

8. Can x and z be coincident (EQ(x,z))?
   No, because if x and z were the same, and NTPP(y,z), then NTPP(y,x) would also hold. But this contradicts EC(x,y).

So, from the above analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)

Actually, I want to re-examine (5) more carefully.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))?
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. 
   Given that EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries. 
   Since NTPP(y,z), y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's think about this geometrically. If both x and y are fully inside z and away from z's boundary, and x and y touch at their boundaries, there's no contradiction. It's like having two circles inside a larger circle, where the two smaller circles touch each other.

So, I think NTPP(x,z) is actually possible.

Let's check again:
1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as explained before.
2. EC(x,z): Possible, as explained before.
3. PO(x,z): Possible, as explained before.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible, as explained before.
5. NTPP(x,z): After reconsideration, this is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible, as explained before.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, as explained before.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible, as explained before.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)
- NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part)

Wait, let me double-check the logic again. 

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts.
If NTPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and y does not touch z's boundary.

Given these, we're trying to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

For DC(x,z), if x is disconnected from z, then it wouldn't be possible for x to touch y (which is inside z), so DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), if x touches z at its boundary but doesn't share any interior parts with z, and y is completely inside z away from its boundary, it's possible for x to touch y at their boundaries. Picture a smaller circle (y) inside a larger circle (z), and a third circle (x) that touches both the smaller circle and the larger circle.

For PO(x,z), if x partially overlaps with z, and y is completely inside z, it's possible for x to touch y at their boundaries as long as the part where they touch is inside z.

For TPP(x,z), if x is a tangential proper part of z (fully inside z but touching z's boundary), and y is fully inside z away from its boundary, it's possible for x to touch y at their boundaries.

For NTPP(x,z), if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (fully inside z and away from z's boundary), and y is also fully inside z away from its boundary, it's possible for x and y to touch at their boundaries.

For TPPi(x,z), if z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary. Since NTPP(y,z), y is fully inside z away from z's boundary. This means y is also fully inside x away from x's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z), if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is fully inside x and away from x's boundary. Since NTPP(y,z), y is fully inside z away from z's boundary. This means y is also fully inside x away from x's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y).

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same, then since NTPP(y,z), y is fully inside x away from x's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)
- NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part)

That concludes my analysis.

Actually, I want to double-check EC(x,z) with a concrete example. Imagine z is a circle. Since NTPP(y,z), y is a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y at their boundaries but they don't overlap. Can x also touch z at its boundary? Yes, x can extend from touching y to also touching z. So EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let's double-check PO(x,z) as well. Still imagining z as a circle and y as a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y at their boundaries. Can x also partially overlap with z? Yes, x can extend from touching y to also overlapping with a portion of z. So PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Now, let's double-check TPP(x,z). Still with z as a circle and y as a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Can x be fully inside z, touch z's boundary, and also touch y's boundary? Yes, this is possible. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Lastly, let's double-check NTPP(x,z). With z as a circle and y as a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary, can x be fully inside z, not touch z's boundary, and also touch y's boundary? Yes, this is also possible. So NTPP(x,z) is also indeed possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)
- NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part)

Actually, I have a moment of doubt about PO(x,z). Let's think about it differently.

For PO(x,z), x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z away from z's boundary.

Can x partially overlap with z and still touch y's boundary?

Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x as another shape. If x partially overlaps with z, it means some part of x is inside z and some part is outside. If y is completely inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then the part of x that touches y's boundary must be inside z (since y is completely inside z). This seems possible.

For another confirmation, let's consider a concrete example: Let z be a square, y be a circle completely inside z away from z's boundary, and x be a rectangle. The rectangle (x) can be positioned such that it overlaps with a portion of the square (z) and also touches the circle (y) at its boundary. This confirms that PO(x,z) is possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)
- NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part)

But I'm still not fully convinced about some of these. Let me think through each possibility more carefully, and give clear explanations.

First, let's set up what we know:
- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z away from z's boundary.

Now, let's go through each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   If x and z are disconnected, then x is completely outside z. But y is completely inside z. So, x and y would be disconnected as well, which contradicts EC(x,y). Hence, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.
   This is possible. Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z, and x as a circle that touches both y's boundary and z's boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z) - x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
   This is possible. Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z, and x as a circle that touches y's boundary and partially overlaps with z. This satisfies EC(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z) - x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
   This is possible. Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z, and x as a circle fully inside z that touches both y's boundary and z's boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
   This is possible. Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z, and x as a circle fully inside z that touches y's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
   If z is part of x, then y, which is completely inside z, would also be completely inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y), which says x and y only touch at their boundaries. Hence, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
   Similarly, if z is part of x, then y, which is completely inside z, would also be completely inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y). Hence, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident.
   If x and z are the same, then y, which is completely inside z, would also be completely inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y). Hence, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)
- NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part)

Let me try to draw this out once more. We're told that y is inside z but not touching the boundary of z. Also, x and y are externally connected.

1. DC(x,z):
   ```
   z: +-------+
      |       |
      |  y    |
      |  /-\  |
      | |   | |
      |  \-/  |
      |       |
      +-------+

   x:     /-\
         |   |
          \-/
   ```
   If x and z are disconnected, then x and y would also be disconnected. But we're told x and y are externally connected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   ```
   z: +-------+
      |       |
      |  y    |
      |  /-\  |
      | |   | |
      |  \-/  |
      |       |
      +-------+
         /-\
   x:   |   |
         \-/
   ```
   Here, x and z touch at their boundaries, and x and y also touch at their boundaries. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   ```
   z: +-------+
      |       |
      |  y    |
      |  /-\  |
      | |   | |
      |  \-/  |
      |   /---\---+
      +--/----+   |
      | /         |
   x: |/          |
      +------------+
   ```
   Here, x and z overlap, but neither is a part of the other. x and y touch at their boundaries. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z):
   ```
   z: +-------+
      |       |
      |  y    |
      |  /-\  |
      | |   | |
      |  \-/  |
      |       |
      |   /-\ |
   x: |  |   ||
      |   \-/ |
      +-------+
   ```
   Here, x is part of z and touches z's boundary. x and y touch at their boundaries. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   ```
   z: +-------+
      |       |
      |  y    |
      |  /-\  |
      | |   | |
      |  \-/  |
      |       |
      |       |
      |  /-\  |
   x: | |   | |
      |  \-/  |
      |       |
      +-------+
   ```
   Here, x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. x and y touch at their boundaries. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   ```
   x: +-------+
      |       |
      |  z    |
      |  +---+|
      |  |   ||
      |  |   ||
      |  | y ||
      |  |/-\||
      |  |   ||
      |  |   ||
      |  +---+|
      |       |
      +-------+
   ```
   If z is part of x, then y, which is completely inside z, would also be completely inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y). Hence, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   ```
   x: +-------+
      |       |
      |       |
      |  z    |
      |  +---+|
      |  |   ||
      |  | y ||
      |  |/-\||
      |  |   ||
      |  +---+|
      |       |
      |       |
      +-------+
   ```
   Similarly, if z is part of x, then y, which is completely inside z, would also be completely inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y). Hence, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
   ```
   x/z: +-------+
        |       |
        |  y    |
        |  /-\  |
        | |   | |
        |  \-/  |
        |       |
        +-------+
   ```
   If x and z are the same, then y, which is completely inside z, would also be completely inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y). Hence, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)
- NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part)

Actually, wait. Let me check NTPP(x,z) again. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z away from z's boundary. And y is also completely inside z away from z's boundary. Can x and y be externally connected if they are both completely inside z?

Let's think about it. If two regions are both completely inside a third region and away from its boundary, can they touch each other? Yes, they can. It's like having two circles inside a larger circle, where the two smaller circles touch each other. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

To be extra sure, let's also check TPP(x,z). If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Can x also touch y, which is completely inside z away from z's boundary? Yes, it's possible for x to both touch z's boundary and touch y.

So, I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)
- NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part)

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. If x is disconnected from z, but y is inside z, then x cannot touch y.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary while also touching y's boundary from outside z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z and touch y's boundary where they overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z, touch z's boundary, and also touch y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z (away from z's boundary) and still touch y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is inside x, then y would be inside x (since y is inside z), contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
