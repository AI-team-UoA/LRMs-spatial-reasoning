PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We're given two spatial relationships:
1. TPPi(x,y) - meaning TPP(y,x) - y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - meaning NTPP(z,y) - z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

I need to determine what the possible relationships between x and z are.

Let's think through this:
- TPPi(x,y) means that x contains y, and y touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that y contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary.

So we have a situation where:
- x contains y
- y contains z
- y touches x's boundary
- z does not touch y's boundary

By transitivity of containment, we know that x contains z. But what we need to determine is whether z touches x's boundary or not.

Given that z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, z must be strictly inside y, which means z is even more "inside" relative to x. This suggests that z doesn't touch x's boundary either.

If z doesn't touch x's boundary and is contained in x, then the relationship between x and z would be NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- x contains y, and y touches x's boundary (TPPi(x,y))
- y contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPPi(y,z))

In this scenario, z is completely inside y, which is touching the boundary of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me re-examine this to make sure I'm not missing any possibilities. The key is to understand how the boundary-touching property works in relation to containment.

Let's visualize this scenario:
- x is a large region with a boundary.
- y is a smaller region inside x, and it touches the boundary of x at some point(s).
- z is an even smaller region inside y, and it does not touch the boundary of y at any point.

Given that z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and y can touch x's boundary, there's no way for z to touch x's boundary (since to do so, it would need to touch y's boundary first). Therefore, z is strictly inside x, not touching x's boundary.

This confirms that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I realized I've been using a different convention for these predicates. Let me correct my analysis:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which is "y is a tangential proper part of x." This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which is "z is a non-tangential proper part of y." This means z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

By transitivity, z is inside x. Now, can z touch x's boundary?

No, because if z were to touch x's boundary, it would have to extend to y's boundary first (since y is between z and x). But we're told that z does not touch y's boundary. Therefore, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Thus, z is inside x and does not touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more careful. I'm not fully considering all the geometric configurations. Let's think again.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is entirely within x, but touches x's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, if z is entirely within y, and y is entirely within x, then z is entirely within x by transitivity. The question is: can z touch the boundary of x?

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y can touch the boundary of x, z is separated from the boundary of x by at least the distance between z and the boundary of y. Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Given that z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, the relationship between z and x is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's try to be even more precise. The way I'm thinking of RCC8 is on continuous regions in Euclidean space, but there might be other configurations or interpretations. Let's carefully consider all possibilities.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which is "y is a tangential proper part of x." This means y is a proper subset of x (y ⊂ x) and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which is "z is a non-tangential proper part of y." This means z is a proper subset of y (z ⊂ y) and z does not share any points with the boundary of y.

By transitivity of the subset relation, if y ⊂ x and z ⊂ y, then z ⊂ x. So z is a proper subset of x.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x? If z were to touch the boundary of x, it would have to contain at least one point on the boundary of x. However, since z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and the only part of y that touches x's boundary is a subset of y's boundary, z cannot contain any points on the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a proper subset of x and does not touch the boundary of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to consider one more potential configuration. Let me try a counterexample to see if there's a scenario where z could touch the boundary of x while still not touching the boundary of y.

For z to touch the boundary of x, it would need to contain a point on the boundary of x. But for z to not touch the boundary of y, it would need to be completely inside y, separated from y's boundary. Given that y touches the boundary of x only at points that are also on the boundary of y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is still NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider using some simpler, concrete examples. 

Let's try to find a counterexample. Imagine a scenario where:
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle that is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x at a single point
- z is an even smaller circle entirely inside y

Can z touch the boundary of x? Since y only touches the boundary of x at a single point, and z is entirely inside y, z would have to extend to that exact point to touch the boundary of x. But if z extends to that point, it would also be touching the boundary of y, which contradicts our given relationship NTPPi(y,z). So, in this simple example, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Let's try another configuration:
- x is a large square
- y is a smaller square inside x, with one side coinciding with a side of x
- z is a small circle entirely inside y

Again, for z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to touch the side of y that coincides with the side of x. But if z touches that side, it would also be touching the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

These examples suggest that the relationship between x and z is indeed NTPPi(x,z).

But let's be absolutely certain by considering all possible configurations:

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x, touching x's boundary.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means z is inside y, not touching y's boundary.

The question is: Can z be inside x and touch x's boundary?

For z to touch x's boundary, there would need to be a point p such that p is both on the boundary of x and a part of z. Since z is entirely inside y, p would also be a part of y. And since p is on the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of x (because TPPi(x,y)), p could potentially be on the boundary of y as well. But if p is on the boundary of y, then z would be touching the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

So, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is inside x and not touching its boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

I'm fairly confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check the definition of the spatial relations to ensure I'm using them correctly:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper subset of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper subset of y, and x does not touch the boundary of y.
TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP, so it means TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which is consistent with what I've been using.
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which is also consistent.

Given these definitions, my reasoning remains the same. The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized that I might not have considered all possible configurations. Let me try to think of a scenario where z could be TPPi to x.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, which implies that z touches the boundary of x. But as I've argued, if z were to touch the boundary of x, it would also have to touch the boundary of y (since the only way for z to reach the boundary of x is through the boundary of y). But this would contradict the given NTPPi(y,z).

So, z cannot be TPPi to x. It can only be NTPPi to x.

Let's also consider if z could be PO to x. PO(x,z) would mean that x and z share a common part, but neither is a subset of the other. But we know that z is a subset of y, and y is a subset of x, so z is a subset of x by transitivity. Hence, z cannot be PO to x.

Similarly, z cannot be DC, EC, EQ, TPP, or NTPP to x given the constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be more precise.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which implies that y is a proper subset of x and y touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which implies that z is a proper subset of y and z does not touch the boundary of y.

By transitivity of the subset relation, if z is a subset of y and y is a subset of x, then z is a subset of x. So we know that z is a subset of x.

Now, the question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would need to be a point p such that p is both on the boundary of x and a part of z. Since z is a subset of y, p would also be a part of y.

Given that y touches the boundary of x (because TPPi(x,y)), there are points on the boundary of x that are also part of y. However, these points are on the boundary of y. For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to reach these boundary points of y. But we're told that z does not touch the boundary of y (because NTPPi(y,z)). So, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a proper subset of x and does not touch the boundary of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me try one more approach. I'll draw out the situation and trace the logical implications step by step.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper subset of x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is a proper subset of y.
- z does not touch the boundary of y.

By combining these:
- z is a proper subset of y, which is a proper subset of x. So, z is a proper subset of x.
- y touches the boundary of x, but z does not touch the boundary of y.

Now, could z touch the boundary of x? If it did, it would have to go through the boundary of y (since z is a subset of y). But z doesn't touch the boundary of y, so it can't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a proper subset of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is the definition of NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be very sure. Let's consider an example in a 2D plane. I can represent x, y, and z as sets of points in the plane.

Let's define x as the set of all points (a, b) where a^2 + b^2 ≤ 4. This is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
Let's define y as the set of all points (a, b) where (a-1)^2 + b^2 ≤ 1. This is a circle of radius 1 centered at (1, 0).
Let's define z as the set of all points (a, b) where (a-1)^2 + b^2 ≤ 0.5. This is a circle of radius 0.5 centered at (1, 0).

In this setup:
- y is a proper subset of x, and y touches the boundary of x at the point (2, 0). So, TPPi(x,y) holds.
- z is a proper subset of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y because the distance from the center of z to the center of y is 0, which is less than the difference of their radii (1 - 0.5 = 0.5). So, NTPPi(y,z) holds.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? The boundary of x is the circle defined by a^2 + b^2 = 4. The distance from the center of z to the origin is 1. The radius of z is 0.5. For z to touch the boundary of x, the distance from the center of z to the origin plus the radius of z should be at least the radius of x. That is, 1 + 0.5 ≥ 2. This is not the case, so z does not touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a proper subset of x and does not touch the boundary of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

Given that I've analyzed the problem using multiple approaches and they all lead to the same conclusion, I'm now very confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

However, I just realized I may have been wrong in my example above. Let me recalculate.

The circle z has a center at (1, 0) and a radius of 0.5. The circle x has a center at the origin and a radius of 2. The distance between the centers is 1. For z to touch the boundary of x, the distance between centers should be the sum of their radii (if they touch from the outside) or the difference of their radii (if one is inside the other). 

In our case, the sum is 2 + 0.5 = 2.5, which is greater than the distance between centers (1). The difference is 2 - 0.5 = 1.5, which is greater than the distance between centers (1). This means neither touching condition is met, so z does not touch the boundary of x.

So, my conclusion stands: the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I misunderstood the problem slightly. Let's be absolutely clear about the spatial relations:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y.

TPPi(x,y) means the inverse of TPP, i.e., TPP(y,x). So, y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(x,y) means the inverse of NTPP, i.e., NTPP(y,x). So, y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given this, TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, and NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since y is a part of x and z is a part of y, z is a part of x by transitivity. The question is whether z is a tangential part of x (i.e., touches the boundary of x) or a non-tangential part of x (i.e., does not touch the boundary of x).

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would need to be a point that is both part of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is a proper part of y, any point in z is also in y. Now, the only way for a point in y to be on the boundary of x is if that point is also on the boundary of y (given that y is a tangential proper part of x). But if a point in z is on the boundary of y, then z would touch the boundary of y, which contradicts the fact that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). In inverse form, that's NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think my reasoning above is correct, so I'll just make a final summary:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is a proper subset of x and y touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is a proper subset of y and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Since z is a subset of y and y is a subset of x, z is a subset of x. The question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to touch the boundary of y first (since the only way for a part of y to reach the boundary of x is through the boundary of y). But since z does not touch the boundary of y (given NTPPi(y,z)), z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a proper subset of x and does not touch the boundary of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I need to be more careful about considering all possible configurations. Let me reconsider the problem.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We want to find all possible relationships between x and z. From my previous reasoning, I've shown that NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let's check if any other relationship is possible:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z is a part of y, and y is a part of x, so z is a part of x. Disconnected regions don't share any points.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect. This is not possible for the same reason as DC.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is not possible because z is a part of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because z is a part of x, not the other way around.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would have to touch the boundary of x. As I've argued before, since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and the only way for a part of y to touch the boundary of x is through the boundary of y, z cannot touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given the constraints, this is the only possible relationship, as I've shown.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is not possible because z is a part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x, not equal to it.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me see if I can find any edge cases or exceptions to my reasoning above.

Could there be a scenario where z touches the boundary of x without touching the boundary of y? Let's think about this geometrically.

Imagine a scenario where y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at a single point p. For z to touch the boundary of x without touching the boundary of y, z would have to extend to the point p without touching any other point on the boundary of y. But if z extends to p, then p is a part of z. And since p is on the boundary of y, z would then touch the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

In fact, the only way for a part of y to touch the boundary of x is at points that are also on the boundary of y. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, it can't touch the boundary of x.

So, there's no way for z to touch the boundary of x given the constraints. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double check the case of a tangential proper part. I've been thinking about this and I realize that my definition of "tangential proper part" is wrong. I forgot that it's the boundary of the region that matters.

Okay, let's try to be very, very precise:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. x is a proper subset of y.
2. The boundary of x touches the boundary of y. i.e, there's at least one point that's both on the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP, so it means TPP(y,x). This implies:
1. y is a proper subset of x.
2. The boundary of y touches the boundary of x. i.e, there's at least one point that's both on the boundary of y and the boundary of x.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. x is a proper subset of y.
2. The boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of y. i.e, there's no point that's both on the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(y,x). This implies:
1. y is a proper subset of x.
2. The boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of x. i.e, there's no point that's both on the boundary of y and the boundary of x.

Given these definitions, let's reason:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So:
1. y is a proper subset of x.
2. The boundary of y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So:
1. z is a proper subset of y.
2. The boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

From 1 in both cases, z is a proper subset of y, and y is a proper subset of x, so z is a proper subset of x.

Now, does the boundary of z touch the boundary of x? If it did, there would be a point p that's both on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Since z is a subset of y, if p is on the boundary of z, it's either on the boundary of y or in the interior of y. But from 2 in the second case, the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y, so p can't be on the boundary of y. Thus, p must be in the interior of y. But if p is in the interior of y, it can't be on the boundary of x (since the interior of y is separated from the boundary of x). So, p can't both be on the boundary of z and the boundary of x.

Therefore, the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). In inverse form, that's NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just realized there's a flaw in my reasoning above. I said, "if p is on the boundary of z, it's either on the boundary of y or in the interior of y". But there's a third possibility: p could be in the exterior of y. However, that's impossible since z is a subset of y.

The rest of the reasoning is sound. The boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of x, so z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the problem using the definitions directly and make sure I have them right. From the RCC-8 calculus:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They don't share any points.
EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some points, but neither is a subset of the other.
TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. x is a proper subset of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. x is a proper subset of y, and x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. Inverse of TPP.
NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Inverse of NTPP.
EQ(x,y): x and y are equal. They have the same points.

Now, we're given:

TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x. Specifically, y is a proper subset of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Specifically, z is a proper subset of y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

From these, we can derive:

1. z is a proper subset of y, and y is a proper subset of x, so z is a proper subset of x.
2. z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x. The question is: can z touch the boundary of x?

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would need to be a point p that's both in z and on the boundary of x. Since z is a subset of y, p is also in y. But since y is a tangential proper part of x, the only points in y that are on the boundary of x are also on the boundary of y. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, z can't contain any point that's on the boundary of y. Therefore, z can't contain any point that's on the boundary of x.

So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). In inverse form, that's NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, now I see that I might have made a logical error in my last explanation. Let me clarify:

If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y touches the boundary of x. This means there are points on the boundary of y that are also on the boundary of x. But there are also points on the boundary of y that are in the interior of x (not on the boundary of x).

Now, for z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to contain a point that's on the boundary of x. Since z is a subset of y, all points in z are also in y. The question is: can z contain a point that's both in y and on the boundary of x?

The points in y that are on the boundary of x are also on the boundary of y. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, z can't contain any of these points. Therefore, z can't contain any point that's on the boundary of x.

So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). In inverse form, that's NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Okay, I think I've been overthinking this. The answer is definitely NTPPi(x,z). Let me provide a clear explanation:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper subset of x, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper subset of y, and the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since z is a subset of y and y is a subset of x, z is a subset of x.

For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to contain a point on the boundary of x. All points in z are also in y, so this point would have to be both in y and on the boundary of x. The points in y that are on the boundary of x are also on the boundary of y. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, z can't contain any of these points. Therefore, z can't contain any point that's on the boundary of x.

So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). In inverse form, that's NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me try to provide a clear and intuitive picture:

Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside x but touching its boundary, and z as an even smaller circle entirely inside y but not touching y's boundary.

In this configuration:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, so TPPi(x,y) holds.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, so NTPPi(y,z) holds.

Now, the question is: what's the relationship between x and z? Since z is entirely inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x. Does z touch the boundary of x? No, because z doesn't even touch the boundary of y, which is the part of y that could potentially touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

I think my reasoning is sound. We know, through the transitivity of the "part of" relation, that if z is a part of y and y is a part of x, then z is a part of x. The only subtlety is whether z touches the boundary of x or not. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and only the boundary of y can touch the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident in this answer. Let's summarize:

We're given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which mean:
- y is a tangential proper part of x.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

From these, we can deduce:
- z is a proper part of x (by transitivity).
- z doesn't touch the boundary of x (as explained above).

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

No wait, I'm not careful enough. Let me verify by going back to the definitions.

From the RCC-8 calculus, the relationships can be understood as:

TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x has a contact with the boundary of y.
NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x does not have a contact with the boundary of y.
TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(y,x).

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we have:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). So, y is a proper part of x, and y has contact with the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). So, z is a proper part of y, and z does not have contact with the boundary of y.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, it follows that z is a proper part of x. The question is: does z have contact with the boundary of x?

Given that z doesn't have contact with the boundary of y, and only the boundary of y can have contact with the boundary of x, z can't have contact with the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a proper part of x without contact with the boundary of x, which is NTPP(z,x). Inversely, it's NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me try to visualize this more concretely. Picture a large circle (x), with a smaller circle (y) inside it but touching its boundary. Now, inside y, there's an even smaller circle (z) that doesn't touch the boundary of y. Given this configuration, z can't touch the boundary of x because it's wholly contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

This confirms that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me verify that I've tried all possible relationships to make sure NTPPi(x,z) is the only possibility:

1. DC(x,z): No, z is a part of x, so they share points.
2. EC(x,z): No, z is a part of x, not just touching at the boundary.
3. PO(x,z): No, z is a proper part of x, not just partially overlapping.
4. TPP(x,z): No, this would mean x is a proper part of z, which contradicts that z is a part of y, and y is a part of x.
5. NTPP(x,z): No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
6. TPPi(x,z): No, this would mean z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. But as argued, z can't touch the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Yes, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): No, z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z can't be equal to x.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I've spent a ton of time thinking about this problem, and I believe the answer is that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relationship can hold between x and z given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Breaking down what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is entirely within x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary.

By transitivity of the "part of" relation, we know z must be inside x since z is inside y and y is inside x.

The key question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

For z to touch the boundary of x, it would need to contain at least one point on x's boundary. Since z is entirely within y, this point would have to be both:
1. Inside y (since all of z is inside y)
2. On the boundary of x

The only points that satisfy both conditions are points on y's boundary that also touch x's boundary. However, since z does not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), z cannot reach these points. Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Since z is entirely within x but does not touch x's boundary, the relationship must be NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).
