PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's first recall what the relations mean:
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. So y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, if x is entirely inside y (not touching y's boundary) and y only touches z at the boundary, then x must be completely disjoint from z. This means that x and z don't share any points, and they don't even touch.

So, the relation between x and z must be DC(x,z), which means that x and z are disconnected.

Actually, let me verify this more carefully by considering all possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while y only touches z at the boundary.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. This is not possible because x doesn't touch y's boundary (due to NTPP(x,y)), and y only touches z at the boundary (due to EC(y,z)). So x can't reach z to touch it.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is not possible because x is entirely inside y and z doesn't overlap with y (it only touches y at the boundary). So x and z can't overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z is outside y and only touches y at the boundary. So x can't be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because z is outside y and only touches y at the boundary, while x is entirely inside y. So z can't be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x is entirely inside y, while z is outside y and only touches y at the boundary. So x and z can't be the same region.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, I think I should double-check this. 

Let's consider NTPP(x,y): x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
And EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, since x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y only touches z at the boundary, there's no way for x to reach z. So x and z must be disconnected, which means DC(x,z).

Yes, the answer is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the implications of NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) on the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch only at their boundaries but don't share interior parts

Since x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (due to NTPP(x,y)), and y only touches z at the boundary (due to EC(y,z)), there's no way for x to reach or interact with z.

The region x is fully contained within the interior of y, and z only contacts the boundary of y without penetrating its interior. Therefore, x and z must be completely disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
