PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We're told that 
1. TPPi(x,y) - this means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z) - this means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now we need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about what we know:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

The possible relationships between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is not possible because y is inside both x and z, so x and z must have some overlap (at least y).

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is not possible for the same reason as DC.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is possible. x and z could overlap in some region that includes y, but neither is completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This is possible. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This is possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This doesn't seem possible. We know that y is inside z, and y touches x's boundary. But if z were inside x and touched x's boundary, then y would also touch x's boundary through z. But that contradicts the fact that y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me rethink that. TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches x's boundary. We know that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So y is definitely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary through z. But we're told that y touches x's boundary (because TPPi(x,y)). This seems like a contradiction.

Wait, I need to think more carefully. TPPi(x,y) means that y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

If y is inside both x and z, and y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary, then it's not possible for z to be completely inside x (which would be TPPi(x,z)). Because if z were inside x, then since y touches x's boundary and y is inside z, z would also have to touch x's boundary at that point. But that would mean y touches z's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(y,z).

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This doesn't seem possible either. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would also be completely inside x without touching x's boundary (since y is inside z). But that contradicts TPPi(x,y), which says y touches x's boundary.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident: This doesn't seem possible. If x and z are the same, then y would have the same relationship with both, but we're told that y has different relationships with x and z.

So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check these conclusions:

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is completely inside the other. Given that y is inside both x and z, this is certainly possible.

2. TPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside both x and z, and y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary, this is also possible. If x touches z's boundary at a point where y doesn't reach, this is consistent with all the constraints.

3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that y is inside both x and z, and y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary, this is also possible. If x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary, this is consistent with all the constraints.

4. TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside both x and z, and y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary, this is not possible. If z touches x's boundary and y is inside z, then y would also touch x's boundary, contradicting the fact that y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Wait, let me think through this more carefully. TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary. NTPP(y,z) means y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is inside x
- y touches x's boundary
- y is inside z
- y doesn't touch z's boundary

Now, if TPPi(x,z) were true, it would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But then we'd have:
- y is inside z
- z touches x's boundary
- y doesn't touch z's boundary

This is a problem because if z touches x's boundary and y is inside z, then y can't touch x's boundary unless it also touches z's boundary. But we know y doesn't touch z's boundary, so y can't touch x's boundary either. This contradicts TPPi(x,y).

So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given that y is inside both x and z, and y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary, this seems possible. If z is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, but y is inside z and manages to reach out to touch x's boundary without touching z's boundary, this is consistent with all the constraints.

Wait, actually, this isn't possible either. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is completely inside z, then y must be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), which says y touches x's boundary.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. Given that y has different relationships with x and z (it touches x's boundary but not z's boundary), this is not possible.

So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, let's recheck these one more time:

PO(x,z): x and z overlap, but neither is completely inside the other.

We know:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Is PO(x,z) possible? Yes, x and z could overlap in the region containing y, but neither is completely inside the other.

TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

We know:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Is TPP(x,z) possible? Yes, x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary at a point where y doesn't reach.

NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

We know:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Is NTPP(x,z) possible? No, this is not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary, then y would be inside z and would not touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, I think I'm actually not thinking about this correctly. Let me go back to the definitions and be more careful.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means "y is a tangential proper part of x". That is, y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means "y is a non-tangential proper part of z". That is, y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary
- y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary

Let's now consider all possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points.
This is not possible because y is inside both x and z, so x and z must overlap at least in the region containing y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, they touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points.
This is not possible for the same reason as DC.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points but neither is completely inside the other.
This is possible. x and z could overlap in the region containing y, but neither is completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
This is possible. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary, and y could be inside both and touch x's boundary but not z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.
This is possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y could be inside both and touch x's boundary but not z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
Let's carefully consider this case. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is completely inside z, then y is also completely inside x. But can y touch x's boundary without touching z's boundary? No, that's not possible. If y touches x's boundary, and z also touches x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y must touch z's boundary at the point where z touches x's boundary. But this contradicts the fact that y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), which means y doesn't touch z's boundary.

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
This is possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y could be inside z. Since y touches x's boundary (because TPPi(x,y)), but y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary at the point where y touches x's boundary. But z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which is consistent with all the constraints.

Wait, let me carefully think about this. If y is inside z, and y touches x's boundary, then z must at least extend to the point where y touches x's boundary. But if z doesn't touch x's boundary, how can y, which is inside z, touch x's boundary? This seems contradictory.

So it seems NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident, they occupy the exact same region.
This is not possible because y has different relationships with x and z.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double check that NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of x", i.e., z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

We know:
- y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary (TPPi(x,y))
- y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z))

If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is completely inside z, then y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which says y touches x's boundary.

So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let's verify that TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of x", i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

We know:
- y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary (TPPi(x,y))
- y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z))

If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is completely inside z, then y is completely inside x. But can y touch x's boundary without touching z's boundary? If z touches x's boundary at a certain point and y doesn't touch z's boundary, then y can't reach that point on x's boundary. And if y touches x's boundary at a different point, then z would have to extend to that point as well, which would mean y touches z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

So I'm sticking with my conclusion: the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

Let me think about this once more, using a graphical intuition.

TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary. So imagine y as a smaller circle that's completely inside the larger circle x, and the circles touch at one point on the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So imagine y as a smaller circle that's completely inside the larger circle z, with some space between the boundaries of y and z.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is certainly possible. Imagine x and z as two circles that overlap, with y in the overlapping region.

2. TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is also possible. Imagine x as a circle inside the larger circle z, touching z's boundary at one point. And then y is a circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a different point.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is also possible. Imagine x as a circle completely inside the larger circle z, with some space between the boundaries of x and z. And then y is a circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y can't touch x's boundary without also touching z's boundary. But NTPP(y,z) means y doesn't touch z's boundary.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y can't touch x's boundary. But TPPi(x,y) means y touches x's boundary.

6. DC(x,z), EC(x,z), EQ(x,z): These are not possible for reasons already discussed.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

I've thought about this from multiple angles and am confident in this answer.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to analyze how TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) constrain the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary)

Let me consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Impossible since y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Impossible for the same reason as DC.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Possible. x and z could overlap in the region containing y, but neither is completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Possible. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary at a point where y doesn't reach.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z touches x's boundary, y (which is inside z) can't touch x's boundary without also touching z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z is inside x without touching x's boundary, y (which is inside z) can't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible because y has different relationships with x and z.
