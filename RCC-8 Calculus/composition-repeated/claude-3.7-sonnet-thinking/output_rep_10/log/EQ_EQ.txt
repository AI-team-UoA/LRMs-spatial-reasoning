PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.
We also know that EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident.

So, if x and y are coincident, and y and z are coincident, then by transitivity, x and z must also be coincident.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is EQ(x,z).

This is the only possible relationship given the transitive property of equality.

Let me double-check with the properties of these relations:

1. DC: disconnected
2. EC: externally connected (touching at boundary)
3. PO: partially overlapping
4. TPP: tangential proper part
5. NTPP: non-tangential proper part
6. TPPi: inverse of TPP
7. NTPPi: inverse of NTPP
8. EQ: equal/coincident

If x = y and y = z (where = denotes spatial coincidence), then x = z.

So the answer is: EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), I need to determine the possible relationship between x and z.

When EQ(x,y), it means that x and y are spatially identical or coincident - they occupy exactly the same space.
When EQ(y,z), it means that y and z are also spatially identical.

If x is identical to y, and y is identical to z, then by the transitive property of equality, x must be identical to z.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
