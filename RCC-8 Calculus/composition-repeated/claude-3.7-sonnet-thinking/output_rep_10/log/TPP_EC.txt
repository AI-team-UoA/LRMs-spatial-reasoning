PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's think about what these constraints tell us:

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is completely contained within y, and x touches y's boundary.

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z externally connect. They touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Let's consider each of the 8 possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   Given that x is within y (touching y's boundary), and y only touches z at the boundary, it's possible that x doesn't touch the part of y's boundary that touches z. In this case, x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect.
   Since x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (from EC(y,z)), it's possible that x touches the exact part of y's boundary that touches z. In this case, x and z would externally connect.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This doesn't seem possible. Since y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points (from EC(y,z)), and x is completely within y (from TPP(x,y)), x cannot overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This doesn't seem possible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would need to be completely within z. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points (from EC(y,z)), and x is completely within y (from TPP(x,y)), x cannot be within z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is definitely not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means TPP(z,x). If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely within x. But given EC(y,z), z touches y only at the boundary. And since TPP(x,y), x is completely within y. This creates a contradiction: z cannot be completely within x while also being outside of y (except for touching y's boundary).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is definitely not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This doesn't seem possible. If x and z were equal, then given TPP(x,y), we would have TPP(z,y). But we're told EC(y,z), which means z and y only touch at their boundaries and don't have any interior points in common. This contradicts TPP(z,y).

So, from my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect.

Let me double-check this by considering some spatial scenarios:

Scenario 1: Imagine y as a circle. z is another circle that touches y at a single point on their boundaries. x is a smaller circle inside y that doesn't touch the point where y and z meet. In this case, DC(x,z) holds.

Scenario 2: Imagine y as a circle. z is another circle that touches y at a single point on their boundaries. x is a smaller circle inside y that also touches the same point where y and z meet. In this case, EC(x,z) holds.

These scenarios confirm that both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully. I want to make sure I'm visualizing this correctly.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z externally connect. They touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, let's consider the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   If x touches y's boundary at a point that is not where y and z touch, then x and z would be disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect.
   If x touches y's boundary at the exact point where y and z touch, then x and z would also touch at their boundaries. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share some interior points. But since EC(y,z), y and z don't share interior points, and TPP(x,y) implies x is completely within y, so x and z cannot share interior points. This is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely within z and touch z's boundary. But since TPP(x,y), x is completely within y. And since EC(y,z), y and z only touch at their boundaries. This means x cannot be completely within z. This is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reasons.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x, which means TPP(z,x).
   For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely within x. But since EC(y,z), z is outside of y except for the boundary point they share. And since TPP(x,y), x is completely within y. So z cannot be completely within x. This is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x).
   This is even less possible than TPPi(x,z) for the same reasons.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   If x and z were equal, then since TPP(x,y), we would have TPP(z,y). But we're given EC(y,z), which means z and y only touch at their boundaries. These two relations (TPP(z,y) and EC(y,z)) are contradictory, so x and z cannot be equal.

So, the only possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect.

I'm confident in this conclusion.

### Answer: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) tell us about the possible relations between x and z.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely contained within y
- x touches y's boundary

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share any interior points

Given these constraints, let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible when x touches y's boundary at a point that is not where y and z touch. In this case, x and z would be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible when x touches y's boundary exactly at the point where y and z touch. In this case, x and z would externally connect at that single point.

3. PO(x,z): Not possible because x is entirely within y, and y only externally connects with z, so x cannot share interior points with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible because x cannot be contained within z when x is contained within y and y only touches z at the boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z cannot be contained within x when z is only touching y at the boundary and x is contained within y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x and z were equal, we'd have both TPP(x,y) and EC(x,y), which is contradictory.
