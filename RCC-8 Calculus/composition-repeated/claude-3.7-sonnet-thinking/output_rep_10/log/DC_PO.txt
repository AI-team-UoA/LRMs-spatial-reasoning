PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We need to determine what RCC-8 spatial relations are possible between regions x and z, given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's think through this step by step:

1. DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected - they don't share any points and don't even touch at their boundaries.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Now, let's consider what constraints these place on the possible relations between x and z.

Since DC(x,y), x doesn't share any points with y.
Since PO(y,z), y shares some points with z, but not all of z is covered by y.

So what can we say about x and z?

- Since x doesn't overlap with y at all, but z does overlap with y, there must be some part of z (the part that overlaps with y) that cannot overlap with x.
- However, there are also parts of z that don't overlap with y, and these parts could potentially have any relationship with x.

Let me consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z and determine if it's consistent with our given information:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. x could be completely separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. x could touch z at the boundary but not overlap with it, while still remaining disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. x could overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x could be completely contained within z (touching z's boundary) in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x could be completely contained within z (not touching z's boundary) in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This seems problematic. If z is contained within x, and y overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So this isn't possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   Similar to TPPi, this would mean z is contained within x, which would contradict DC(x,y) given that PO(y,z). So this isn't possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This isn't possible because if x and z are equal, and y overlaps with z, then y must overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Since DC(x,y), x doesn't share any points with y. And since PO(y,z), y overlaps with parts of z. For this to be consistent, x must be in parts of z that don't overlap with y.

For NTPP(x,z):
Similarly, if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. Again, for this to be consistent with DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x must be in parts of z that don't overlap with y.

Both of these scenarios seem possible, so my conclusion stands.

The possible relations between x and z, given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But let me think a bit more carefully about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). 

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. This means that x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), x must not overlap with y. Given that PO(y,z), y overlaps with some part of z. 

Let's visualize: z is a region, x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, and y overlaps with z but not with x.

This seems possible. We can have z as a large region, with x being a part of z near one of its boundaries, and y overlapping with z in a different area away from x.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. We can have a similar visualization as before, with x being more "centered" within z and away from y's overlap with z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, it's not entirely clear to me if TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible. Let me think through these more carefully.

For TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Now, given PO(y,z), y overlaps with z. If z is completely contained within x, and y overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x. But this contradicts DC(x,y), which states that x and y are disconnected. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given PO(y,z), y would have to overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y overlaps with z, then y must overlap with x. But this contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, my conclusion remains the same. The possible relations between x and z, given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's see if I can come up with examples for each:

1. DC(x,z):
   Imagine x, y, and z as three separate regions with y and z overlapping, but x is completely disconnected from both.

2. EC(x,z):
   Imagine x and z as two regions that touch at their boundaries, with y overlapping with z on the side away from x.

3. PO(x,z):
   Imagine x and z as two overlapping regions, with y overlapping with z on the side away from x.

4. TPP(x,z):
   Imagine z as a large region, x as a smaller region inside z and touching z's boundary, and y overlapping with z on the side away from x.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   Imagine z as a large region, x as a smaller region inside z but not touching z's boundary, and y overlapping with z on the side away from x.

These all seem consistent with DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, in conclusion, the possible relations between x and z, given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze what we know:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no shared points)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some interior points)

Examining each potential relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be completely separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary while remaining disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be contained within z (touching z's boundary) in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely contained within z (not touching z's boundary) in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were contained within x, and y overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, and y overlaps with z, then y would overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).
