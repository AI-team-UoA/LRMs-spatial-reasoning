PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

In this problem, we are dealing with the RCC-8 qualitative spatial reasoning calculus. We have the following information:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

We want to find the possible spatial relationships between x and z, given this information.

Let's think about what the constraint EC(x,y) means geometrically. It means that x and y are touching at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap. Similarly, EC(y,z) means that y and z are touching at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap.

Now, let's consider what this means for the relationship between x and z.

There are several possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be disconnected. 
   For example, imagine x and z as two separate regions that both touch y, but are far apart from each other.

2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected. 
   For example, x and z could both touch y at the same point, thereby also touching each other at that point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap. 
   For example, imagine x and z as two regions that both touch y, but also overlap with each other.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z. 
   For example, x could be inside z and touching the boundary of z, while both x and z touch y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z. 
   For example, x could be completely inside z (not touching the boundary of z), while both x and z touch y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x. 
   This is the inverse of TPP(x,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x. 
   This is the inverse of NTPP(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal. 
   For example, x and z could be the same region, both touching y.

Let's think about each of these possibilities more carefully to see if any can be ruled out.

For DC(x,z), it's definitely possible for x and z to be disconnected. Imagine y as a middle region that touches both x and z, but x and z are far apart.

For EC(x,z), it's also possible for x and z to be externally connected. Imagine x and z touching at a point, and y also touching both x and z at the same point.

For PO(x,z), it's possible for x and z to partially overlap. Imagine x and z as two overlapping regions, with y touching both x and z at their boundaries.

For TPP(x,z), it's possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z. Imagine x as a small region inside z, touching the boundary of z, and y touching both x and z at that point.

For NTPP(x,z), I'm not sure if this is possible given the constraints. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z. But if both x and y are touching at their boundaries, and y and z are touching at their boundaries, it seems like x should also be touching the boundary of z. Let me think...

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) is possible. Imagine z as a large region, y as a small region touching the boundary of z, and x as a small region inside z (not touching the boundary of z) but touching y.

For TPPi(x,z), it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x. Imagine z as a small region inside x, touching the boundary of x, and y touching both x and z at that point.

For NTPPi(x,z), using similar reasoning as for NTPP(x,z), I think this is also possible.

For EQ(x,z), it's possible for x and z to be equal. Imagine x and z as the same region, both touching y.

So, based on my reasoning, all eight RCC-8 relations seem to be possible for the relationship between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, let me double-check by drawing out a few examples to make sure.

For DC(x,z), we can have x and z as two separate regions that both touch y, but are far apart from each other. For example:
```
    x
     \
      y
     /
    z
```
Here, x and z are disconnected, y touches both x and z, so EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) hold, and DC(x,z) holds.

For EC(x,z), we can have x and z touching at a point, and y also touching both x and z. For example:
```
    x---y---z
```
Here, x and z are touching at a point, y touches both x and z, so EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) hold, and EC(x,z) holds.

For PO(x,z), we can have x and z as two overlapping regions, with y touching both x and z at their boundaries. For example:
```
      y
     /
    x---z
```
Here, x and z partially overlap, y touches both x and z at their boundaries, so EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) hold, and PO(x,z) holds.

For TPP(x,z), we can have x as a small region inside z, touching the boundary of z, and y touching both x and z at that point. For example:
```
      y
     /
    z
   /
  x
```
Hmm, that doesn't quite work, let me try again. Conceptually, we need x to be inside z, touching the boundary of z, and y should be outside z but touching z at the point where x also touches the boundary of z.

Actually, let's use a different notation. Let's use capital letters to denote regions, and lower-case letters to denote boundary points. So, for example, Xa represents a point a on the boundary of region X.

With this notation, for TPP(x,z), we need something like:
```
X inside Z, X touches Z at point a, Y outside Z, Y touches Z at point a
```
So, we have EC(X,Y) because X and Y touch at point a, EC(Y,Z) because Y and Z touch at point a, and TPP(X,Z) because X is inside Z and touches the boundary of Z.

Actually, I'm making a conceptual error. EC(X,Y) means that X and Y touch at *their* boundary, not at some arbitrary point. So, for example, if X is inside Z, then the boundary of X is not the same as the boundary of Z. 

Let me rethink this. 

If EC(X,Y) and EC(Y,Z), then X and Y touch at their boundaries, and Y and Z touch at their boundaries. But these could be different points on the boundary of Y.

For DC(X,Z), X and Z could be disconnected. Imagine X and Z as two separate regions that both touch Y, but are far apart from each other. Let's say X touches Y at point a on the boundary of Y, and Z touches Y at point b on the boundary of Y, where a and b are different points.

For EC(X,Z), X and Z could be externally connected. Imagine X and Z both touching Y at the same point on the boundary of Y, and also touching each other at that point.

For PO(X,Z), X and Z could partially overlap. Imagine X and Z as two overlapping regions, with Y touching the boundary of X at a point where X and Z don't overlap, and Y touching the boundary of Z at a point where X and Z don't overlap.

For TPP(X,Z), X could be a tangential proper part of Z. Imagine X inside Z, touching the boundary of Z at a point. Y touches Z at the same point, and Y is outside Z.

For NTPP(X,Z), I don't think this is possible. If X is a non-tangential proper part of Z, then X is completely inside Z and doesn't touch the boundary of Z. But if EC(X,Y), then X and Y touch at their boundaries. Since Y touches the boundary of X, and X is inside Z, Y must also be inside Z to touch X. But if Y is inside Z, then Y doesn't touch the boundary of Z, contradicting EC(Y,Z).

For TPPi(X,Z), using similar reasoning as for TPP(X,Z), I think this is possible by swapping the roles of X and Z.

For NTPPi(X,Z), I don't think this is possible, using similar reasoning as for NTPP(X,Z).

For EQ(X,Z), I don't think this is possible. If X and Z are equal, then they have the same boundary. If Y touches the boundary of X at a point, then Y also touches the boundary of Z at the same point. But then Y must be outside both X and Z, which means Y can't be externally connected to both X and Z simultaneously.

Wait, I've made an error in my thinking. EC(X,Y) doesn't necessarily mean that X and Y touch at a point. It means that the boundaries of X and Y intersect, but their interiors don't. So, the boundaries of X and Y could intersect along a line or a curve, not just at a point.

So, actually, EQ(X,Z) could be possible. If X and Z are the same region, and Y touches the boundary of X (which is the same as the boundary of Z), then EC(X,Y) and EC(Y,Z) hold, and EQ(X,Z) holds.

Let me reconsider NTPP(X,Z) and NTPPi(X,Z) as well.

For NTPP(X,Z), X is a non-tangential proper part of Z, which means X is completely inside Z and doesn't touch the boundary of Z. But if EC(X,Y), then X and Y touch at their boundaries. Since X doesn't touch the boundary of Z, Y must be inside Z to touch X. But if Y is inside Z, then Y doesn't touch the boundary of Z, contradicting EC(Y,Z). So, NTPP(X,Z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(X,Z), using similar reasoning as for NTPP(X,Z), I think this is also not possible.

Actually, I just realized another error in my thinking. EC(X,Y) means that the boundaries of X and Y intersect, but their interiors don't. It doesn't necessarily mean that X and Y touch along a single point or line. The boundaries could intersect in more complex ways.

Let me reconsider the problem. We're given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and we want to find the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z).

Let's carefully reason through the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. Imagine x and z as two separate regions that both touch y, but are far apart from each other.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. Imagine x and z as two regions that touch at their boundaries, and y also touches both x and z at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): This seems possible. Imagine x and z as two overlapping regions, with y touching both x and z at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): This seems possible. Imagine x as a region inside z, touching the boundary of z, and y touching the boundary of z at the same point.

5. NTPP(x,z): Let's carefully analyze this. If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. But if EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries. Since x doesn't touch the boundary of z, y must be inside z to touch x. But if y is inside z, then y doesn't touch the boundary of z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This seems possible. Imagine z as a region inside x, touching the boundary of x, and y touching the boundary of x at the same point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Using similar reasoning as for NTPP(x,z), I think this is also not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This seems possible. Imagine x and z as the same region, and y touching the boundary of x (which is the same as the boundary of z).

So, based on my reasoning, the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Wait, I have to more carefully analyze if EQ(x,z) is possible. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), if x and z are the same, then we're saying EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). This doesn't immediately strike me as a contradiction, so I think EQ(x,z) is still possible.

Actually, let's be extra careful. EC(x,y) means that the boundaries of x and y intersect, but their interiors don't. EC(y,z) means that the boundaries of y and z intersect, but their interiors don't. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. So, we're saying that the boundaries of x and y intersect, the boundaries of y and z (which is the same as x) intersect, but the interiors of x and y don't intersect, and the interiors of y and z (which is the same as x) don't intersect. This doesn't seem contradictory, so I think EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I just realized there's a useful property here. EC is a symmetric relation, meaning EC(x,y) is the same as EC(y,x). So, if EQ(x,z), then EC(y,z) is the same as EC(y,x), which is the same as EC(x,y). So, the two given constraints become redundant, and there's no contradiction.

So, I'm sticking with my conclusion: the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Let's double-check by reasoning through some specific examples:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine x and z as two separate regions on opposite sides of y.
```
x --- y --- z
```
Here, x and z are disconnected, and both touch y.

2. EC(x,z): Imagine x and z as two regions that touch at a point, and y also touches both at that point.
```
x
|\
| \
|  \
y---z
```
Here, x and z touch at a point, and y touches both x and z.

3. PO(x,z): Imagine x and z as two overlapping regions, with y touching both x and z at their boundaries.
```
    y
   /|
  / |
 /  |
x---z
| \ |
|  \|
|   \
```
Here, x and z partially overlap, and y touches both x and z at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine x as a region inside z, touching the boundary of z, and y touching the boundary of z at the same point.
```
   y
   |
   v
 +---+
 |   |
 | x |
 +---+
   z
```
Here, x is a tangential proper part of z, and y touches the boundary of z at the same point where x touches the boundary of z.

5. TPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of TPP(x,z), so we swap the roles of x and z in the example above.

6. EQ(x,z): Imagine x and z as the same region, and y touching the boundary of x (which is the same as the boundary of z).
```
   y
   |
   v
 +---+
 |   |
 |x=z|
 +---+
```
Here, x and z are the same region, and y touches the boundary of both.

These examples confirm my conclusion: the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, one more check for NTPP: If x is strictly inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, and y is outside z and touches the boundary of z, then y cannot touch x, contradicting EC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi: If z is strictly inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is outside x and touches the boundary of x, then y cannot touch z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the final answer is: the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

But let me reconsider if EQ(x,z) is actually possible.

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. So, we're saying that the boundaries of x and y intersect, the boundaries of y and x intersect, but the interiors of x and y don't intersect, and the interiors of y and x don't intersect. It seems like we're repeating the same constraint, which doesn't add any new information. But it doesn't contradict anything either, so I think EQ(x,z) is still possible.

Actually, wait: if EQ(x, z), then we have EC(x, y) and EC(y, x). According to the definition, EC(x, y) means that x and y touch at their boundary but do not share any interior parts. EC(y, x) is just the same relation but with the arguments swapped (since the relation is symmetric). We have the same exact relation being asserted twice, which doesn't lead to a contradiction. So, EQ(x, z) is still possible.

Let me carefully review the final answer one more time: the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let's go through a slightly different analysis for EQ(x, z).

If EQ(x, z), then x and z are the same region. So, we're essentially asking if EC(x, y) and EC(y, x) can both be true. Since EC is a symmetric relation, EC(x, y) implies EC(y, x). So, the two constraints are redundant, and there's no contradiction. So, EQ(x, z) is possible.

So, I think my final answer is correct: the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let me rethink my analysis for EQ(x, z) one more time. 

If EQ(x, z), then x and z are the same region. Given EC(x, y) and EC(y, z), if x and z are the same, then we're saying EC(x, y) and EC(y, x). Since EC is a symmetric relation, EC(x, y) implies EC(y, x). So, the two constraints are redundant, and there's no contradiction. So, EQ(x, z) is possible.

I think I'm overthinking this, so let's see if I can come up with a simple example for EQ(x, z):

Imagine x and z as the same region, and y as another region that touches x (and hence z) at the boundary.
```
   +---+
   |   |
   | y |
   +---+
     |
     v
   +---+
   |   |
   |x=z|
   +---+
```
Here, x and z are the same region, y touches the boundary of x (which is the same as the boundary of z), so EC(x, y) and EC(y, z) hold, and EQ(x, z) holds.

So, I'm confident that EQ(x, z) is possible.

My final answer is: the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let me try one more mental experiment for EQ(x, z).

Let's say x and z are the same circular region, and y is another circular region that touches x (and hence z) at a single point on the boundary.

```
    y
   /
  /
 x = z
```

In this scenario, the boundaries of x and y intersect at a point, but their interiors don't. Similarly, the boundaries of y and z (which is the same as x) intersect at the same point, but their interiors don't. So, EC(x, y) and EC(y, z) hold, and EQ(x, z) holds.

So, I'm even more confident that EQ(x, z) is possible.

In summary, the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z) given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible. Consider x and z as separate regions on opposite sides of y, both touching y at their boundaries but not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible. X and z can touch at their boundaries while both also touching y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. X and z can partially overlap while both externally connect to y at their respective boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. X can be a tangential proper part of z (inside z but touching z's boundary), with y touching z at the same boundary point where x touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x cannot simultaneously touch y's boundary while y touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. This is the inverse of TPP, where z is a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible. By the same reasoning as NTPP.

8. EQ(x,z) - Possible. If x and z are identical regions, they can both externally connect to y.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
