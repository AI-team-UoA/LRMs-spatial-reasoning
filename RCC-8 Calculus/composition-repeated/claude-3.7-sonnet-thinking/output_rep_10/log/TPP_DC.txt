PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason about the possible relationships between x and z given that TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is a proper part of y (fully contained in y) and touches y's boundary.
- DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They don't share any points, not even boundary points.

Now, let's think about what TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) together tell us about the possible relations between x and z.

Since TPP(x,y), x is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z have no points in common. 

If y and z have no points in common, and x is fully contained in y, then x and z should also have no points in common. 

So, the only possible relationship between x and z should be DC(x,z), meaning x and z are disconnected.

Let me double-check this.

TPP(x,y) means x is fully inside y, touching y's boundary.
DC(y,z) means y and z are completely separate with no common points.

Since x is inside y and y has no common points with z, x cannot have any common points with z either.

So, x and z must be disconnected, which is represented by DC(x,z).

Wait, let me be a bit more careful here. x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x touches y's boundary. z is disconnected from y, which means z doesn't share any points with y. 

Is it possible that x touches z at the boundary of y? If x touches the boundary of y, and z is outside of y, could they possibly touch at that boundary?

No, that's not possible. Since DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points, including boundary points. So, even if x touches the boundary of y, it can't touch z because z doesn't share any points with y, including its boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let's double-check this with a different perspective.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are completely separate with no common points. Since x is a part of y (from TPP(x,y)), all points in x are also in y. Since no points in y are in z (from DC(y,z)), no points in x can be in z. So, x and z must be disconnected, which is DC(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully. 

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary.
DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, so they don't share any points.

If x is fully contained in y and y doesn't share any points with z, then x and z can't share any points either. So, x and z must be disconnected, which is DC(x,z).

Let me verify this once more to make sure.

TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
DC(y,z): y and z don't share any points.

Can x and z share any points? No, because all points in x are also in y (since x is a part of y), and y doesn't share any points with z. So, x and z don't share any points, which means DC(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me try again with a more rigorous approach.

I'm thinking about this in terms of the possible relationships from the RCC-8 calculus:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (they touch at the boundary but don't overlap).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), let's check each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
   This is possible. As I explained earlier, since x is a part of y and y is disconnected from z, x and z must also be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   Is this possible? x is inside y and touches y's boundary. z is outside y and doesn't touch y. Can x and z touch? No, because if x and z touched, then y and z would also touch (since x is a part of y), which contradicts DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Is this possible? No, because if x and z overlapped, then y and z would also overlap (since x is a part of y), which contradicts DC(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? No, because if x were a part of z, then x would have to overlap with z, which we've established is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to the above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? No, because if z were a part of x, then z would also be a part of y (since x is a part of y), which contradicts DC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to the above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   Is this possible? No, because if x were equal to z, then x would be equal to z, which means y and z would overlap (since x is a part of y), contradicting DC(y,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check EC(x,z) once more to be sure.

EC(x,z) means x and z are externally connected, touching at the boundary without overlapping. TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and touches y's boundary. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected.

Could x touch z at a point on the boundary of y? No, because if that were the case, then y would also touch z at that point, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let's also check the other relationships to be thorough.

PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. If x and z overlapped, then y and z would also overlap (since x is a part of y), which contradicts DC(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x were a part of z, then x would have to overlap with z, which we've established is not possible. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the above, this is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z were a part of x, then z would also be a part of y (since x is a part of y), which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the above, this is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If x were equal to z, then y and z would overlap (since x is a part of y), contradicting DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, from all these checks, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, wait. I realized there's a subtlety I didn't consider. Let's revisit the RCC-8 definitions to make sure I have them right:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they don't share any points).
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at the boundary but don't overlap).
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some parts but neither is a part of the other).
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (the inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (the inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), let me think again about the possible relationships between x and z.

TPP(x,y) means x is fully inside y and touches y's boundary. DC(y,z) means y and z don't share any points. 

If x is inside y and y doesn't share any points with z, then x and z can't share any points either. So, x and z must be disconnected, which is DC(x,z).

Let me check the other relationships again:

EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary. But if x and z touched, then y and z would also touch (since x is a part of y), which contradicts DC(y,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. But if x and z overlapped, then y and z would also overlap (since x is a part of y), which contradicts DC(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. But if x were a part of z, then x would have to overlap with z, which we've established is not possible. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the above, this is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. But if z were a part of x, then z would also be a part of y (since x is a part of y), which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the above, this is not possible.

EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. But if x were equal to z, then y and z would overlap (since x is a part of y), contradicting DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

I'm convinced that DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what the given relations tell us:

1. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y - x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

2. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected - they share no points, not even boundary points.

Since x is fully contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), and y shares no points with z (from DC(y,z)), it follows that x cannot share any points with z either.

If x touched or overlapped with z in any way, then y would also have to share points with z (since x is part of y), which would contradict DC(y,z).

Therefore, x and z must be disconnected from each other.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
