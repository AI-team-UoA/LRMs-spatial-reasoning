PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Let's consider the possible RCC-8 relationships that could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since x is part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y is part of z (TPP(y,z)), it follows that x must be part of z. So, x and z cannot be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z are externally connected (they touch at the boundary). But since x is contained within y and y is contained within z, it's not possible for x to be externally connected to z. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, it follows that x must be a proper part of z. Proper part relationships are stronger than partial overlap. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)) and x touches y's boundary (TPP(x,y)), it's possible for x to touch z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z but does not touch z's boundary. If x is inside y without touching y's boundary (which is not the case here since TPP(x,y)), or if y is inside z without touching the part of z's boundary that x touches, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is also a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, z cannot be a proper part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, z cannot be a proper part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, x and z cannot be coincident. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check by considering the composition table for RCC-8. For TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think more carefully about whether both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible.

Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
Given TPP(y,z), we know that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the two possible scenarios:

1. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to touch z's boundary if x touches a part of y's boundary that also touches z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

2. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z but not touch z's boundary. If x touches a part of y's boundary that does not touch z's boundary, then x would not touch z's boundary. In this case, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

Let me visualize this:

For TPP(x,z):
z: ┌───────────┐
   │           │
   │  y: ┌───┐ │
   │     │   │ │
   │     │x┌─┘ │
   │     └─┘   │
   │           │
   └───────────┘

Here, x touches y's boundary, and that part of y's boundary also touches z's boundary, so x touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
z: ┌───────────┐
   │           │
   │  y: ┌───┐ │
   │     │   │ │
   │     │ x┌┘ │
   │     │ └┘  │
   │     └─────┘
   │           │
   └───────────┘

Here, x touches y's boundary, but the part of y's boundary that x touches does not touch z's boundary, so x does not touch z's boundary.

Based on these considerations, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure that I have not made a mistake. I feel that NTPP(x,z) is possible, but I should check whether it is true that: if TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then NTPP(x,z) can hold. 

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z but not touch z's boundary.

Given TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x touches a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z (i.e., not touching z's boundary), then x would be inside z but not touching z's boundary, which is NTPP(x,z).

Let me visualize this more carefully:

For NTPP(x,z):
```
z: ┌───────────┐
   │           │
   │  y: ┌───┐ │
   │     │   │ │
   │     │ x│  │
   │     │  │  │
   │     └───┘ │
   │           │
   └───────────┘
```

In this diagram:
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary, which is TPP(x,y).
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary, which is TPP(y,z).
- But x is inside z and does not touch z's boundary, which is NTPP(x,z).

So, indeed, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship when TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

To double-check with the RCC-8 composition table:
For TPP(x,y) ∘ TPP(y,z), the result is {TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)}.

This confirms that the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's be absolutely certain: it's possible for x to touch a part of y's boundary that also touches z's boundary (resulting in TPP(x,z)), or for x to touch a part of y's boundary that doesn't touch z's boundary (resulting in NTPP(x,z)).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Since TPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
Since TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let me analyze the possibilities:

1. x must be contained within z (since x is in y and y is in z)
2. x cannot be disconnected from, externally connected to, or partially overlapping z
3. x cannot be equal to z or contain z (since x is smaller than y, which is smaller than z)

This leaves two possibilities:

- TPP(x,z): This occurs when x touches a part of y's boundary that also touches z's boundary, making x touch z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): This occurs when x only touches parts of y's boundary that are in the interior of z, making x completely in the interior of z without touching z's boundary.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
