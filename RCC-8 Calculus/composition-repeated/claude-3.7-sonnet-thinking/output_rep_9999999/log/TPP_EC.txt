PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's figure out the possible relationships between x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is contained in y and touches y's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? 
   Since x is fully contained in y, and y only touches z at the boundary, it's possible that x is completely disconnected from z, not touching z at all. This would happen if x doesn't reach the part of y's boundary that touches z.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z touch at their boundaries?
   Since x touches y's boundary (due to TPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (due to EC(y,z)), it's possible that x touches precisely the part of y's boundary that also touches z. In this case, x and z would externally connect.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   For this to happen, x and z would need to share some interior points. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), and x is fully contained in y (TPP(x,y)), x and z cannot share any interior points. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   For this to happen, x would need to be fully contained in z and touch z's boundary. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), and x is fully contained in y (TPP(x,y)), x cannot be contained in z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   For this to happen, x would need to be fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), and x is fully contained in y (TPP(x,y)), x cannot be contained in z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   For this to happen, z would need to be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), z cannot be contained in y, and since x is contained in y (TPP(x,y)), z cannot be contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   For this to happen, z would need to be fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), z cannot be contained in y, and since x is contained in y (TPP(x,y)), z cannot be contained in x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are coincident?
   For this to happen, x and z would need to be exactly the same region. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), and x is properly contained in y (TPP(x,y)), x and z cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So it looks like the only possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me double check the case of EC(x,z). I said that it's possible that x touches precisely the part of y's boundary that also touches z. But I need to make sure this is consistent with the given relations.

TPP(x,y) means that x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's think of a concrete example. Imagine y is a circle, and x is a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at one point. Now imagine z is another circle outside y, touching y's boundary at one point.

If the point where x touches y's boundary is the same as the point where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would touch at that point, making EC(x,z) true.

If the point where x touches y's boundary is different from the point where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would not touch at all, making DC(x,z) true.

So both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are indeed possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me think once more about the case PO(x,z). I previously ruled this out, but I want to make sure my reasoning is correct.

PO(x,z) means that x and z share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Given TPP(x,y), x is fully contained in y.
Given EC(y,z), y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points.

Since x is fully contained in y, all of x's interior points are also interior points of y.
Since y and z don't share interior points, none of y's interior points can be interior points of z.
Therefore, none of x's interior points can be interior points of z.

So x and z cannot share interior points, which means PO(x,z) is not possible.

Let me also double check the case of TPP(x,z), which I previously ruled out.

TPP(x,z) means that x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Given TPP(x,y), x is fully contained in y.
Given EC(y,z), y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be fully contained in z. But since x is fully contained in y, and y doesn't share interior points with z, x cannot be contained in z.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me check the case of NTPP(x,z) as well.

NTPP(x,z) means that x is properly contained in z without touching z's boundary.

Given TPP(x,y), x is fully contained in y.
Given EC(y,z), y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. But since x is fully contained in y, and y doesn't share interior points with z, x cannot be contained in z.

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

And let me check TPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means that z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary, which is the same as TPP(z,x).

Given TPP(x,y), x is fully contained in y.
Given EC(y,z), y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be fully contained in x. But since z touches y only at the boundary, and doesn't share interior points with y, z cannot be contained in y. And since x is contained in y, z cannot be contained in x.

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

And let me check NTPPi(x,z).

NTPPi(x,z) means that z is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary, which is the same as NTPP(z,x).

Given TPP(x,y), x is fully contained in y.
Given EC(y,z), y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. But since z touches y only at the boundary, and doesn't share interior points with y, z cannot be contained in y. And since x is contained in y, z cannot be contained in x.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

And finally, let me check EQ(x,z).

EQ(x,z) means that x and z are exactly the same region.

Given TPP(x,y), x is properly contained in y.
Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be exactly the same region. But since x is contained in y, and z is not contained in y (since it only touches y at the boundary), x and z cannot be the same region.

So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In conclusion, the only possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me think about the PO(x,z) case one more time, because I want to make sure my reasoning is correct.

PO(x,z) means that x and z share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Given TPP(x,y), x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to share some interior points. But since y and z don't share interior points (by EC(y,z)), and x's interior points are all interior points of y (by TPP(x,y)), x and z cannot share interior points.

So PO(x,z) is not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts

Actually, let me just double check using a concrete example, because I realize there's another important aspect to consider.

Let y be a disk (a filled-in circle), and let z be another disk such that y and z touch at a single boundary point (satisfying EC(y,z)).

For TPP(x,y), x should be a proper subset of y that touches y's boundary. Let's consider a few cases for x:

Case 1: Let x be a smaller disk within y, touching y's boundary at a point that's different from where y touches z. In this case, x and z are completely disconnected, so DC(x,z) holds.

Case 2: Let x be a smaller disk within y, touching y's boundary exactly at the point where y touches z. In this case, x and z touch at a single boundary point, so EC(x,z) holds.

These examples confirm that both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Furthermore, I've shown that the other six RCC-8 relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible for x and z under these conditions.

So the final answer is:
The possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) tell us about the spatial arrangement.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y
- x touches y's boundary

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share any interior points

Given these conditions, I'll examine each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x doesn't reach the part of y's boundary that touches z. Since x is inside y and y only touches z at the boundary, x can be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary exactly at the point where y touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Not possible. Since x is inside y and y doesn't share interior points with z, x and z cannot partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. Since y and z only touch at boundaries, x cannot be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Similar to above, x cannot be inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. Since z is outside y (except at boundary points) and x is inside y, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Similar to above, z cannot be inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since x is inside y and z is outside y (except at boundary points), they cannot be equal.
