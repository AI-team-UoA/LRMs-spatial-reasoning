PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's recall the meaning of these relations:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected; they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now I need to determine what RCC-8 relation could hold between x and z. Let's analyze the possibilities systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y in a region that doesn't touch z, then x and z could be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y in such a way that part of x's boundary coincides with the part of y's boundary that touches z, then x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This doesn't seem immediately possible because y and z don't share interior points (they only touch at boundaries). Since x overlaps with y's interior, it would be unlikely for x to also overlap with z's interior.

Actually, let me think more carefully about PO(x,z). It is actually possible. If x extends beyond y in such a way that it also overlaps with part of z, then x and z would partially overlap. This requires x to cross the boundary where y and z touch.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This is possible if x is positioned such that it overlaps with y, and is completely contained within z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This is possible if x is positioned such that it overlaps with y, and is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible if z is completely contained within x while touching x's boundary, and x overlaps with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is possible if z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, and x overlaps with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This doesn't seem possible because if x = z, then the relation between y and x would be the same as the relation between y and z. But we're given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), which are different relations.

Let me double-check my reasoning for some of the less obvious cases:

For TPP(x,z): If x is contained within z and touches z's boundary, and x also partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, then this scenario seems geometrically consistent.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is contained within z without touching z's boundary, and x also partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, this scenario seems harder to visualize but might still be possible.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is contained within x and touches x's boundary, and x also partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, this scenario seems challenging to visualize given the constraints. But I believe it's still possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): If z is contained within x without touching x's boundary, and x also partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, this scenario seems geometrically inconsistent. If z is inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, then y would have to extend into x, which contradicts the NTPPi relation between x and z.

I need to be more careful with my reasoning. Let me try to visualize these scenarios more precisely.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), I need to check if they're consistent with our given constraints. If z is a (non-tangential or tangential) proper part of x, and y is externally connected to z, then y touches z at its boundary. Since z is entirely within x, this means y touches or intersects with x as well. We're given that PO(x,y), so this is consistent.

Let me revise my analysis:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Possible.
2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Possible.
3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Possible.
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Possible.
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Possible.
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: Possible.
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: Not possible because it would mean PO(x,y) and EC(y,x), which is contradictory.

Hmm, I'm not completely confident in this analysis. Let me reconsider some of these cases.

For NTPP(x,z), if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, then y would have to cross z's boundary to reach x. This seems to contradict the EC(y,z) relation. So NTPP(x,z) should not be possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is externally connected to z, then y touches z's boundary. This means y penetrates into x to touch z. This is consistent with PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me revisit each case with more careful reasoning:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is possible. If y is positioned between x and z such that x overlaps with a part of y that's away from z, and y touches z at a different location, then x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is possible. If x overlaps with y and extends to the point where y touches z, then x and z can be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is possible. If x overlaps with y and also extends beyond y to overlap with part of z, then x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This is possible. If x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, and x also overlaps with y which is externally connected to z, then this configuration is consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This is not possible. If x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x overlaps with y, then y would have to penetrate z to reach x. This contradicts EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible. If z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and y is externally connected to z, then y touches z's boundary. This means y intersects with x, which is consistent with PO(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is possible. If z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary, and y is externally connected to z, then y touches z's boundary. This means y penetrates into x to touch z, which is consistent with PO(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This is not possible. If x = z, then the relation between y and x would be the same as the relation between y and z. But we're given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), which are different relations.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me re-check the case for NTPP(x,z). If x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x overlaps with y which is externally connected to z, then y would have to cross z's boundary to reach x. This seems to contradict EC(y,z). But what if y is externally connected to z at a part that's not near x? Well, if y is externally connected to z, then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z's interior. If x is inside z without touching its boundary, then x is in z's interior. If y overlaps with x, then y overlaps with z's interior, which contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Now, let's double-check each case one more time:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine y as a "bridge" between x and z. X partially overlaps with one end of y, z touches the other end of y, and x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x overlapping with y and extending to the point where y touches z. Then x and z touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x overlapping with y and also extending beyond y to overlap with part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x as a small region inside z that touches z's boundary, and y as a region that overlaps with x and touches z's boundary from the outside.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible, as explained above.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. Imagine z as a small region inside x that touches x's boundary, and y as a region that overlaps with x and touches z's boundary from the outside.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. Imagine z as a small region deep inside x, and y as a region that overlaps with x and extends to touch z's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible, as explained above.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I just realized I need to be more careful about TPP(x,z). If x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, and x also overlaps with y which is externally connected to z, then y would overlap with part of x which is inside z. This means y overlaps with part of z's interior, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

With that correction, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually I need to be careful about my reasoning. Let me think step by step.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Let's think about these relationships in terms of the interiors and boundaries of the regions:

For PO(x,y): 
- The interior of x intersects with the interior of y
- The interior of x intersects with the exterior of y
- The interior of y intersects with the exterior of x

For EC(y,z):
- The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z
- The interior of y does not intersect with the interior of z
- The interior of y does not intersect with the boundary of z
- The boundary of y does not intersect with the interior of z

Now, let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected.
This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y in a region away from where y touches z, then x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries.
This is possible. If x overlaps with y and extends to the point where y touches z, then x and z can touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some parts, but neither is part of the other.
This is possible. If x overlaps with y and also extends to overlap with part of z, then x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z.
Let's think about this carefully. If x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, and x also overlaps with y, then y would have to overlap with part of z's interior to reach x. But we're given that EC(y,z), which means y doesn't overlap with z's interior. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
Similar to the previous case, if x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary, and x overlaps with y, then y would have to overlap with part of z's interior to reach x. This contradicts EC(y,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x.
This is possible. If z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (as per EC(y,z)), then y can overlap with part of x without z (satisfying PO(x,y)).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
This is possible. If z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (as per EC(y,z)), then y can overlap with part of x without z (satisfying PO(x,y)).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal.
If x = z, then the relation between y and x would be the same as the relation between y and z. But we're given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), which are different relations. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me recheck my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). I'm not convinced these are impossible.

For TPP(x,z): If x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, and y overlaps with x, does this contradict EC(y,z)?

Let's think about it: If y overlaps with x, and x is inside z touching z's boundary, then y would have to overlap with part of z's interior to reach x. But EC(y,z) means y only touches z's boundary and doesn't overlap with z's interior. So TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary, and y overlaps with x, then y would have to overlap with part of z's interior to reach x. This contradicts EC(y,z), so NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

I'm now confident that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let's double-check TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) as well.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (as per EC(y,z)), then y can overlap with part of x without overlapping with z. This is consistent with PO(x,y), so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): If z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (as per EC(y,z)), then y can overlap with part of x without overlapping with z. This is consistent with PO(x,y), so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are indeed: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I'm having second thoughts about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me analyze these more carefully.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (as per EC(y,z)), can y overlap with x (as per PO(x,y))?

Yes, y can overlap with a part of x that doesn't contain z, while also touching z's boundary. This is consistent with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): If z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (as per EC(y,z)), can y overlap with x (as per PO(x,y))?

Yes, y can overlap with a part of x that doesn't contain z, while also touching z's boundary. This is consistent with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me double check these one more time with some simple illustrations in mind:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
Imagine three regions where y is between x and z. X partially overlaps with y on one side, z touches y on the other side, and x and z are disconnected.
```
  x     z
 /.\   /.\
/...\-/...\
\.../ \_./ 
 \_/   
   y
```
In this simple ASCII diagram, the dash represents the external connection between y and z, and x partially overlaps with y. So DC(x,z) is definitely possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
Imagine x overlapping with y and extending to the point where y touches z. Then x and z touch at their boundaries.
```
  x     
 /.\   
/...\_  
\.../ \ 
 \_/  z
   y
```
Here, x extends to the point where y touches z, so x and z are externally connected. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
Imagine x overlapping with y and also extending to overlap with part of z.
```
  x     
 /.\    z
/...\_-/.\
\.../ \./
 \_/   
   y
```
Here, x overlaps with y and also extends to overlap with part of z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
Imagine z as a small region inside x that touches x's boundary, and y as a region that overlaps with x and touches z's boundary from the outside.
```
    x     
   /.\   
  /...\_  
 /....z.\
 \.../|\./
  \_/y|
      |
```
Here, z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, y touches z's boundary, and y overlaps with part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
Imagine z as a small region deep inside x, and y as a region that overlaps with x and extends to touch z's boundary.
```
     x     
    /.\   
   /...\_  
  /...z..\_
  \../|\./ 
   \_/y|
       |
```
Here, z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary, y touches z's boundary, and y overlaps with part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

These simple illustrations confirm that the relations DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi are all possible between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I'm missing something important, which is the possibility of combining relations. I need to think about the composition of these relations.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition of two relations is the set of all possible relations that can hold between two regions given the relations they each have with a third region.

So we're looking at the composition of PO and EC, which can be written as PO ∘ EC. This gives us the set of all possible relations that can hold between x and z given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

According to composition tables for RCC-8, the composition PO ∘ EC is {DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi}. This confirms our analysis above.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, to be extremely careful, let me try to derive the composition PO ∘ EC from first principles.

PO(x,y) means:
- The interior of x intersects with the interior of y
- The interior of x intersects with the exterior of y
- The interior of y intersects with the exterior of x

EC(y,z) means:
- The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z
- The interior of y does not intersect with the interior of z
- The interior of y does not intersect with the boundary of z
- The boundary of y does not intersect with the interior of z

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with these constraints:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
This means the closure of x does not intersect with the closure of z.
This is consistent with our constraints. If x overlaps with y in a region away from where y touches z, then x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
This means the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of z, but their interiors do not intersect.
This is consistent with our constraints. If x overlaps with y and extends to the point where y touches z, then x and z can touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
This means the interior of x intersects with the interior of z, the interior of x intersects with the exterior of z, and the interior of z intersects with the exterior of x.
This is consistent with our constraints. If x overlaps with y and also extends to overlap with part of z, then x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
This means the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of z, and the interior of z intersects with the exterior of x.
Let's check if this is consistent with our constraints. If x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, and x also overlaps with y, then y would have to overlap with part of z's interior to reach x. But EC(y,z) means y doesn't overlap with z's interior. So TPP(x,z) is not consistent with our constraints.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
This means the closure of x is a subset of the interior of z.
Similar to the previous case, if x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary, and x overlaps with y, then y would have to overlap with part of z's interior to reach x. This contradicts EC(y,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not consistent with our constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
This means the interior of z is a subset of the interior of x, the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x, and the interior of x intersects with the exterior of z.
This is consistent with our constraints. If z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (as per EC(y,z)), then y can overlap with part of x without overlapping with z. This is consistent with PO(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
This means the closure of z is a subset of the interior of x.
This is consistent with our constraints. If z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (as per EC(y,z)), then y can overlap with part of x without overlapping with z. This is consistent with PO(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
This means the interior of x equals the interior of z and the boundary of x equals the boundary of z.
If x = z, then the relation between y and x would be the same as the relation between y and z. But we're given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), which are different relations. So EQ(x,z) is not consistent with our constraints.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

This aligns with our previous analysis and the known composition PO ∘ EC = {DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi}.

I'm confident in my answer:

The possible relations between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: 
- DC (disconnected)
- EC (externally connected)
- PO (partially overlapping)
- TPPi (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- NTPPi (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each potential relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible. If x partially overlaps with y in a region away from where y touches z, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible. If x overlaps with y and extends to the point where y touches z, then x and z can touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. If x overlaps with y and also extends beyond y to overlap with part of z, then x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Not possible. If x is entirely within z touching z's boundary, and x overlaps with y, then y would have to overlap with z's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible. If x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary, and x overlaps with y, then y would have to overlap with z's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. If z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, y can touch z's boundary while overlapping with a different part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible. If z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary, y can touch z's boundary while overlapping with a different part of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x = z, then y would need to have the same relation with both, but PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are different relations.
