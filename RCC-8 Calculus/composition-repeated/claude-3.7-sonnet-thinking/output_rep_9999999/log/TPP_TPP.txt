PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the relationships:

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

2. TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine what possible RCC-8 relationships can hold between x and z.

Let's go through each possibility:

- DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know x is contained in y, and y is contained in z. So x must be contained in z as well. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

- EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But again, x is contained in y, and y is contained in z, so x must be properly contained in z as well. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

- PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, each having a part that the other doesn't have. But x is contained in y, and y is contained in z, so x must be properly contained in z as well. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

- TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x will touch z's boundary as well.

- NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is properly contained in z and does not touch z's boundary. This is also possible. If x touches y's boundary at points that are in the interior of z (i.e., not at points where y touches z's boundary), then x will not touch z's boundary.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. But x is contained in y, and y is contained in z, so z cannot be contained in x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is properly contained in x and does not touch x's boundary. But similar to TPPi, we know x is contained in y, and y is contained in z, so z cannot be contained in x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the exact same space. But x is properly contained in y, and y is properly contained in z, so x must be properly contained in z as well. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me verify this by thinking about a simple example. Imagine:
- x is a small circle touching the boundary of y
- y is a larger circle containing x and touching the boundary of z
- z is an even larger circle containing y

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x will also touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) true.

If x touches y's boundary only at points that are in the interior of z, then x will not touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) true.

This confirms that both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, let me reconsider this one more time. 

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z

The question is: what is the relationship between x and z?

Let's think step by step:

1. We know that x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z.
2. By transitivity of the "proper part" relation, x is a proper part of z.
3. But we need to determine if x is tangential to z (touches z's boundary) or not.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, making the relationship TPP(x,z).

If x only touches y's boundary at points that are in the interior of z (i.e., not where y touches z's boundary), then x would not touch z's boundary, making the relationship NTPP(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible, so the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I believe this analysis is correct.

Let me make sure by considering a few more examples.

Example 1:
- x is a small circle touching the boundary of y at a single point
- y is a larger circle containing x and touching the boundary of z at a single point
- z is an even larger circle containing y

If the point where x touches y's boundary is also the point where y touches z's boundary, then x would touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) true.

Example 2:
- x is a small circle touching the boundary of y at a point A
- y is a larger circle containing x and touching the boundary of z at a point B
- z is an even larger circle containing y

If points A and B are different, then x would not touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

To confirm once more, let's think about all other relationships and check if they're possible:
- DC(x,z): No, because x is part of y, and y is part of z, so x must be part of z.
- EC(x,z): No, for the same reason as DC.
- PO(x,z): No, because x is properly contained in z.
- TPPi(x,z): No, because x is part of z, not vice versa.
- NTPPi(x,z): No, for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z): No, because x is properly contained in y, and y is properly contained in z, so x and z cannot be equal.

So, we are left with TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) as the only possible relationships.

Actually, let me consider one more case to triple-check:

Consider a geometry where:
- x is a small circle tangent to a circle y at a point P
- y is a circle properly contained in circle z
- the point P is inside z (not on its boundary)
- however, there's another point on y's boundary (call it Q) that touches z's boundary

In this case, we have TPP(x,y) because x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary at P. We also have TPP(y,z) because y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary at Q. But the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z) because x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary (the point P is inside z, not on its boundary).

This example confirms that NTPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Similarly, if x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) valid.

Let me now confirm for all RCC-8 relations by thinking about the definition of each relation and whether it could hold between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z):

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, i.e., they share no points. This is not possible because x is part of y and y is part of z, so x is part of z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect, i.e., they touch but don't overlap. This is not possible because x is part of y and y is part of z, so x is part of z and they definitely overlap.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, i.e., they have some parts in common and some parts that are not in common. This is not possible because x is entirely contained in y and y is entirely contained in z, so x is entirely contained in z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible, as illustrated in our examples.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is also possible, as illustrated in our examples.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because x is part of y and y is part of z, so z cannot be part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal, i.e., they have the same boundaries. This is not possible because x is properly contained in y and y is properly contained in z, so x and z have different boundaries.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I am certain of this.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Since TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
Since TPP(y,z), we know that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

By transitivity, x must be a proper part of z. However, there are two possibilities regarding whether x touches z's boundary:

1. TPP(x,z): If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x will also touch z's boundary.

2. NTPP(x,z): If x only touches y's boundary at points that are in the interior of z (i.e., not at points where y touches z's boundary), then x will not touch z's boundary.

All other RCC-8 relations are impossible because x must be properly contained within z.
