PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z based on the given information:
- EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts)
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is properly inside z but touches z's boundary)

I'll use the composition table for RCC-8 relations to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

When we compose EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we need to consider all possible ways that regions x and z could be related given the constraints.

First, let me think about what these relations mean spatially:
- EC(x,y): x and y only share boundary points, no interior overlap
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Given these constraints:
1. Since y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)) and x touches y's boundary (from EC(x,y)), it's possible that x is disconnected from z (DC(x,z))
2. It's also possible that x touches z's boundary (EC(x,z))
3. x could partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))

Let me check if there are other possibilities:
- NTPP(x,z) is not possible because x touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, so x cannot be completely in the interior of z
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is inside x, which contradicts that y is inside z and x only touches y's boundary
- NTPPi(x,z) would also contradict our given relations for similar reasons
- EQ(x,z) is not possible because it would mean x and z are the same region, which contradicts the given relations

So from reasoning through the spatial configurations, the possible relations between x and z are:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(x,z)

But let me double-check this against the standard RCC-8 composition table.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of EC and TPP gives:
EC(x,y) âˆ˜ TPP(y,z) = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}

So my earlier reasoning missed one possibility: NTPP(x,z). Let me think about why this might be possible...

Actually, I need to reconsider. If y is a tangential proper part of z (touches z's boundary), and x is externally connected to y (touches y's boundary), there are scenarios where x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This would be NTPP(x,z).

So the correct answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.
TPP(y,z) means y is properly inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these constraints, let me analyze the possible configurations:

1. DC(x,z): x could be completely disconnected from z
2. EC(x,z): x could touch z at the boundary
3. PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (completely inside z without touching its boundary)

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible because they would contradict the given relationships.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
