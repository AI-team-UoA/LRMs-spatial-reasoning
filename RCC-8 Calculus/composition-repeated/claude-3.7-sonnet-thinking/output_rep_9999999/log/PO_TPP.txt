PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about what these relations mean spatially:

1. PO(x,y): x and y overlap partially. They share some interior points, but each also has some points that are not in the other.

2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that all of y is contained within z, and at least some part of y touches the boundary of z.

Now, given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x and y overlap (PO), and y is entirely contained within z (TPP), then x and z must have at least some shared points (the ones that x shares with y). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
   It's possible that x extends outside of z and only touches z at the boundary. This can happen if the part of x that overlaps with y is right at the boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is definitely possible. If x partially overlaps with y, and y is inside z, then x can partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This can happen if x is smaller than y or if x extends beyond y but still remains within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is entirely contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This can happen if x is deep inside y, and y is inside z but touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This doesn't seem possible. If y is a proper part of z (TPP), and x only partially overlaps with y (PO), then z cannot be a proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This also doesn't seem possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This doesn't seem possible. If y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y, then x and z cannot be equal.

So, based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

However, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure.

For EC(x,z):
Actually, I need to reconsider this. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points. If TPP(y,z), then all of y, including its interior, is contained within z. So, the interior points of y that are also in x must be interior points of z. This means that x and z share interior points, which contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z):
If x partially overlaps with y, and y is entirely contained within z, then x shares some interior points with z (those it shares with y). But does x have points outside of z? Since x has points outside of y (due to PO(x,y)), and y is inside z, it's possible for x to have points outside of z. So, PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For TPP(x,z):
For this to be true, x must be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary. Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's possible for x to be entirely within z (if the parts of x outside of y are still within z) and touch z's boundary (possibly at the same points where y touches z's boundary). So, TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For NTPP(x,z):
For this to be true, x must be entirely contained within z but not touch z's boundary. Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's possible for x to be entirely within z (if the parts of x outside of y are still within z) and not touch z's boundary (if x doesn't extend to the parts of y that touch z's boundary). So, NTPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):
These imply that z is a proper part of x, which doesn't align with the given constraints. If y is a proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x only partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), then z cannot be a proper part of x. So, these are not valid possibilities.

For EQ(x,z):
If y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y, then x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Actually, there's one more possibility I haven't fully considered: DC(x,z).

For DC(x,z):
If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points. If TPP(y,z), then all of y, including its interior, is contained within z. So, the interior points of y that are also in x must be interior points of z. This means that x and z share interior points, which contradicts the definition of DC. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me review my analysis to ensure I haven't overlooked anything:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because x and z must share some interior points (those that x shares with y).
2. EC(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as DC.
3. PO(x,z): Possible if x has parts outside of z.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely within z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z cannot be a proper part of x given the constraints.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because x and z cannot be equal given the constraints.

Actually, let me reconsider TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) one more time.

For TPPi(x,z):
This means that z is a tangential proper part of x. If y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), can z be a tangential proper part of x?

For this to happen, z would need to be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary. But if y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y, there would be parts of z (those parts of z outside of y) that wouldn't be guaranteed to be within x. So, TPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Using similar reasoning as above, this doesn't seem possible either.

But wait, I think I might have missed something. Let's approach this more carefully.

Let's denote the regions as sets:
- PO(x,y) means that x ∩ y ≠ ∅, x \ y ≠ ∅, and y \ x ≠ ∅.
- TPP(y,z) means that y ⊂ z (proper inclusion) and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's see what these imply for the relationship between x and z:

From PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.

From TPP(y,z), we know that y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Let's think about the possible regions for x:

1. Parts of x inside y: These parts are definitely inside z (since y is inside z).
2. Parts of x outside y: These parts could be inside or outside z.

Let's go through the RCC-8 relations one by one:

1. DC(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must be disconnected. But x shares points with y, and y is inside z, so x and z must share points. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must touch only at their boundaries. But x shares interior points with y, and y is inside z, so x and z must share interior points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must share some interior points, but neither can be fully contained in the other. We've already established that x and z share interior points (through y). For PO(x,z) to be true, x must also have points outside of z. This is possible if the parts of x outside of y extend beyond z.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be fully contained within z and touch z's boundary. This is possible if the parts of x outside of y remain within z and at least some part of x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be fully contained within z but not touch z's boundary. This is possible if the parts of x outside of y remain within z and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be fully contained within x and touch x's boundary. We know that y is inside z. If x only partially overlaps with y, there would be parts of z outside of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,z). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be fully contained within x but not touch x's boundary. Using similar reasoning as for TPPi, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must be the same region. If y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y, then x and z cannot be the same. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check this one more time:

1. If TPP(y,z) and PO(x,y), can DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) be true?
   No, because x shares interior points with y, and all of y is inside z, so x must share interior points with z.

2. If TPP(y,z) and PO(x,y), can PO(x,z) be true?
   Yes, if x has parts outside of z.

3. If TPP(y,z) and PO(x,y), can TPP(x,z) be true?
   Yes, if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

4. If TPP(y,z) and PO(x,y), can NTPP(x,z) be true?
   Yes, if x is entirely within z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

5. If TPP(y,z) and PO(x,y), can TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) be true?
   No, because if y is inside z and x only partially overlaps with y, z cannot be entirely within x.

6. If TPP(y,z) and PO(x,y), can EQ(x,z) be true?
   No, because if y is a proper part of z and x only partially overlaps with y, x and z cannot be the same.

Wait, let me reconsider DC(x,z).

If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can x and z be disconnected? From PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some points. From TPP(y,z), we know that all of y is inside z. Therefore, the points shared by x and y are also inside z, which means x and z share some points. Hence, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for EC(x,z), can x and z touch only at their boundaries? From PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some interior points. From TPP(y,z), we know that all of y's interior is inside z's interior. Therefore, the interior points shared by x and y are also inside z's interior, which means x and z share interior points. Hence, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me think carefully about TPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be fully contained within z and touch z's boundary. If PO(x,y), then x has parts outside of y. These parts of x could be outside of z, in which case x is not fully contained within z. But it's also possible that all parts of x, including those outside of y, are still within z, in which case x is fully contained within z. If at least some part of x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is true.

Is it guaranteed that x touches z's boundary? Not necessarily. If the parts of x outside of y don't touch z's boundary, then x wouldn't touch z's boundary. But if y touches z's boundary (which is guaranteed by TPP(y,z)) and the point of contact is also in x (which is possible with PO(x,y)), then x would touch z's boundary.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible, but not guaranteed.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x must be fully contained within z but not touch z's boundary. This is possible if all parts of x, including those outside of y, are within z but not touching z's boundary.

For PO(x,z), x and z must share some interior points (which is guaranteed) and neither can be fully contained in the other. For this to be true, x must have some parts outside of z. This is possible if the parts of x outside of y extend beyond z.

Alright, based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me consider once more a case involving EC. I was assuming that y is a spatial region with an interior. But if y is a simple line or curve with no interior, then the argument I made doesn't hold. In the RCC-8 calculus, are we assuming that all regions have interiors?

Upon further reflection, I think yes - in the RCC-8 calculus, all regions are assumed to be regular closed sets, which means they have interiors. So the argument I made still holds.

So, the final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Wait - let me think about this more clearly by constructing some examples.

For PO(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle that partially overlaps with y, another circle. And z is a larger circle that fully contains y but is not much larger. In this case, x will partially overlap with z, sharing some interior points but also having some parts outside of z.

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine y as a circle inside a larger circle z, touching z's boundary. Now, x is a circle that partially overlaps with y and is fully contained within z, also touching z's boundary (possibly at a different point than where y touches z). In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z):
Imagine y as a circle inside a larger circle z, touching z's boundary. Now, x is a small circle partially overlapping with y and fully contained within z, but not touching z's boundary. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me try to disprove one of the relations to ensure my answer is correct.

Can I disprove TPPi(x,z)? For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be fully contained within x and touch x's boundary. Since TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. If z is fully contained within x, then y must also be fully contained within x. But PO(x,y) means that y is not fully contained within x. Hence, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me recheck whether DC(x,z) is possible. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points. If TPP(y,z), then all of y, including its interior, is contained within z. So, the interior points shared by x and y must also be inside z. This means that x and z share interior points, which contradicts DC(x,z). Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, actually, I'm realizing there's an issue with my understanding. If x partially overlaps with y, it means there are parts of x outside of y. But this doesn't necessarily mean that those parts of x outside of y must be outside of z. They could be inside z, which would make x a proper part of z (either TPP or NTPP, depending on whether x touches z's boundary).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

This is consistent with my previous analysis, so I'm confident in this answer.

Let's confirm: The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I'll analyze the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is fully contained in z, we know:
- x and z must share some interior points (the parts x shares with y)
- Parts of x may extend outside of z

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as x and z share interior points (through y)
2. EC(x,z): Not possible, as x and z share interior points (through y)
3. PO(x,z): Possible if x extends outside z
4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible as z cannot be contained in x (y is contained in z but not in x)
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for same reason as TPPi
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible as x partially overlaps with y, while z fully contains y

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
