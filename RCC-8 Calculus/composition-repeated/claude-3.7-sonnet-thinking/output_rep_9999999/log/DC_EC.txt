PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what are the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts

Let me analyze this systematically by considering what we know:
- x is completely separate from y (they don't even touch)
- y touches z at their boundaries

Because x and y are disconnected, and y only touches z at the boundary, x could have various relationships with z:

1. DC(x,z): x could be completely disconnected from z
   This is possible if x is so far away from y that it's also disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x could touch z at their boundaries
   This is possible if x happens to touch z's boundary at some point, even though x doesn't touch y.

3. PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z
   This is possible if part of x overlaps with z in a region that doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible if x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary, and y is outside or touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is outside or touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible if z is completely inside x but touches x's boundary, and y touches z at their boundaries.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is possible if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal
   This seems impossible because if x equals z, then y would have to both be disconnected from x (given DC(x,y)) and touching z at the boundary (given EC(y,z)), which is a contradiction.

Let me check each of these for consistency:

DC(x,z): Clearly possible. x is disconnected from y, and y touches z, so x can be disconnected from z.

EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z at some point on z's boundary that is different from where y touches z.

PO(x,z): Possible. x can overlap with some part of z that doesn't include y or y's contact point with z.

TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be contained within z, touching z's boundary, while y touches z at a different point on z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, while y touches z's boundary from the outside.

TPPi(x,z): This requires z to be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. Given that y is disconnected from x but touches z's boundary, this scenario seems inconsistent. If z is a proper part of x, and y touches z, then y would have to touch or overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely inside x, and y touches z, then y would have to overlap or touch x, contradicting DC(x,y).

EQ(x,z): As noted earlier, this is impossible due to the contradiction it would create with the given relations.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi and NTPPi:

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. If y touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must also be touching or overlapping with x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z):
If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary. If y touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must be within or overlapping with x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me be more careful about my reasoning for TPPi and NTPPi.

For TPPi(x,z):
If TPPi(x,z), then TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x but touches x's boundary. Now, given EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. Since z touches x's boundary, it's possible that y touches z precisely at a point where z also touches x's boundary. In this case, y would also be touching x's boundary, which contradicts DC(x,y) because DC means they don't even touch.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If NTPPi(x,z), then NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. Since z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, y would have to penetrate into x to touch z, which means y and x would overlap, contradicting DC(x,y).

So I confirm that TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given the constraints.

I've now analyzed all 8 possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, and concluded that the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I think I need to be more careful. Let me think again by considering what the constraints DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) mean in terms of the spatial relationships:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no parts. They don't even touch.
EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

Now let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is clearly possible. x can be far away from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
   This is possible. x can touch z at a point on z's boundary that's different from where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. x can overlap with a part of z that doesn't include or touch y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary. This is consistent with DC(x,y) if y is outside z or touches z at a different part of its boundary than where x touches it.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is consistent with DC(x,y) if y is outside z or touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is completely inside x but touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. If z touches x's boundary at the same point where y touches z, then y would also be touching x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

   But what if z touches x's boundary at a point different from where y touches z? In that case, y could still be disconnected from x while touching z. So TPPi(x,z) seems possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. Since z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, y would have to penetrate into x to touch z, which means y and x would overlap, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same region, and y touches z (given EC(y,z)), then y also touches x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Wait, I need to be more careful about TPPi(x,z).

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at the boundary. If y touches z at a point where z also touches x's boundary, then y would also be touching x, contradicting DC(x,y).

If y touches z at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary, then y would have to be inside x to touch z, meaning y and x overlap, contradicting DC(x,y).

So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible, and the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

On second thought, let me check my reasoning about TPPi(x,z) once more.

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary at some points. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. 

For y to touch z without touching or overlapping with x, y must touch z at a point on z's boundary that isn't also on x's boundary. But if z is a tangential proper part of x, every point on z's boundary is either inside x or on x's boundary. If y touches z at a point inside x, then y overlaps with x, contradicting DC(x,y). If y touches z at a point on x's boundary, then y touches x, also contradicting DC(x,y).

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): x can be completely disconnected from z
   - This is possible if x is away from both y and z

2. EC(x,z): x can touch z at their boundaries
   - This is possible if x touches z at a different point than where y touches z

3. PO(x,z): x can partially overlap with z
   - This is possible if x overlaps with parts of z that don't include or touch y

4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z
   - This is possible if x is inside z, touching z's boundary, while y touches z elsewhere

5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z
   - This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible
   - If z were inside x, then y (which touches z) would have to either touch or overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y)

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible
   - Similar contradiction as TPPi

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible
   - If x equals z, then y would have to both touch z and be disconnected from x, which is contradictory
