PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z, given that TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x
- z is a proper part of y, and z touches the boundary of y

From these facts, we can conclude that z is a proper part of x (because proper part is a transitive relation: if z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, then z is a proper part of x).

Now, we need to determine whether z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x)). This depends on whether z touches the boundary of x.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

1. TPP(z,x) would be true if z touches the boundary of x.
2. NTPP(z,x) would be true if z does not touch the boundary of x.

Given that:
- z touches the boundary of y (from TPP(z,y))
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x))

Does this mean that z must touch the boundary of x? Not necessarily. 

Let me visualize this: If y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x at some point, and z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y at some point, then z could either:
- Touch the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, in which case z also touches the boundary of x, making TPP(z,x) true.
- Touch the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x, in which case z might not touch the boundary of x, making NTPP(z,x) true.

So, both TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are possible relationships between z and x, which translates to TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) respectively.

Actually, let me double-check this.

If TPPi(x,y), then x properly contains y and y touches the boundary of x. If TPPi(y,z), then y properly contains z and z touches the boundary of y.

From this, we know that x properly contains z (through transitivity). But does z touch the boundary of x?

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z touches the boundary of x, which makes TPP(z,x) true, or equivalently, TPPi(x,z) true.

2. If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x, which makes NTPP(z,x) true, or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z) true.

3. There might be another scenario where z touches the boundary of x at a point where y doesn't. But this is not possible because z is completely contained within y, so if z touches a point, that point must be part of y or on the boundary of y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Ah, wait a moment. I should reconsider this.

If TPPi(x,y), then TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
If TPPi(y,z), then TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

From these, we can derive that z is a proper part of x (through transitivity of the proper part relation). But whether z is a tangential proper part or a non-tangential proper part of x depends on whether z touches the boundary of x.

Now, given:
- z touches the boundary of y (from TPP(z,y))
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x))

Let's think about this geometrically. If z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, then z might touch the boundary of x if the point where z touches the boundary of y is the same as the point where y touches the boundary of x. But z might also be entirely inside x without touching its boundary, if the point where z touches the boundary of y is not the same as the point where y touches the boundary of x.

Okay, let me summarize:
- z is definitely a proper part of x.
- z might be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z)) if it touches the boundary of x.
- z might be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z)) if it doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me check if there could be any other possible relationships.

Given the eight RCC-8 relations:
1. DC (disconnected)
2. EC (externally connected)
3. PO (partially overlapping)
4. TPP (tangential proper part)
5. NTPP (non-tangential proper part)
6. TPPi (inverse of TPP)
7. NTPPi (inverse of NTPP)
8. EQ (equal)

And we know:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

From these, we can derive:
- z is a proper part of x (through transitivity).

Now, let's check each relation to see if it's possible between x and z:
1. DC(x,z): Not possible because z is a part of x, so they must share spatial parts.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible because z is a part of x, so they must share interior parts.
3. PO(x,z): Not possible because z is a proper part of x, not just a partial overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible because it would mean x is a proper part of z, which contradicts the fact that z is a proper part of x.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is a proper part of x, not equal to x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify my answer by checking the conditions again:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

From these, we know:
- y is properly contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y and touches the boundary of y.

This means z is properly contained in x (through transitivity). Now, does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x, which makes TPPi(x,z) true.

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x, which makes NTPPi(x,z) true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this once more. What about the case where y is properly contained in x but doesn't touch the boundary of x? That would make NTPP(y,x) or NTPPi(x,y) true, not TPPi(x,y). So, given that TPPi(x,y) is true, y must touch the boundary of x.

And what about the case where z doesn't touch the boundary of y? That would make NTPP(z,y) or NTPPi(y,z) true, not TPPi(y,z). So, given that TPPi(y,z) is true, z must touch the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- y is properly contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y and touches the boundary of y.

From these, z is properly contained in x. And z might or might not touch the boundary of x, depending on the specific geometrical arrangement. If z touches the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) is true. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) is true.

So, the answer remains the same: the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Ahh, wait, I think I've been thinking about this incorrectly.

Let me restart. 

TPPi(x,y) means that TPP(y,x) is true. TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

TPPi(y,z) means that TPP(z,y) is true. TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.

From these, we can derive:
- z is a proper part of x (through transitivity of the proper part relation).

Now, the question is: what relation in the RCC-8 calculus holds between x and z?

Since z is a proper part of x, the possible relations are TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x), which translate to TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) respectively.

The distinction between TPP and NTPP is whether the proper part touches the boundary of the whole. In this case, whether z touches the boundary of x.

Given that z touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of x, there are two possibilities:
1. z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, z touches the boundary of x, and TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z) is true.
2. z touches the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, z does not touch the boundary of x, and NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) is true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me actually check again if all the other RCC-8 relations can be ruled out:

1. DC (disconnected): This means x and z don't share any spatial parts. This is not possible because z is a proper part of x, which means they share spatial parts.
2. EC (externally connected): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Again, since z is a proper part of x, they share interior parts, so EC is not possible.
3. PO (partially overlapping): This means x and z share some spatial parts, but neither is a part of the other. Since z is a proper part of x, PO is not possible.
4. TPP (tangential proper part): This would mean x is a proper part of z, which contradicts z being a proper part of x. So, TPP is not possible.
5. NTPP (non-tangential proper part): Similarly, this would contradict z being a proper part of x, so NTPP is not possible.
6. TPPi (inverse of TPP): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which is possible if z touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi (inverse of NTPP): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is possible if z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ (equal): This would mean x and z are coincident, which contradicts z being a proper part of x. So, EQ is not possible.

Only TPPi and NTPPi remain as possible relations between x and z.

So, the final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I'll analyze what we know about the relationships:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
2. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

From these facts, I can determine:
- z is inside y (proper part)
- y is inside x (proper part)
- Therefore, z is inside x (proper part) by transitivity

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? There are two possibilities:
- If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary, making TPPi(x,z) true
- If z touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch x's boundary, then z doesn't touch x's boundary, making NTPPi(x,z) true

Both scenarios are geometrically possible, so both relationships could exist.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
