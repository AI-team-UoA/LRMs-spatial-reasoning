PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that:
1. EC(x,y) - x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
2. DC(y,z) - y and z are disconnected, meaning they don't share any points (neither boundary nor interior).

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. Given that DC(y,z), y and z are completely separate. 

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - This is possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is completely separate from y, then x and z could also be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z) - This is also possible. x could touch z at the boundary while still maintaining EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z) - This is possible. x could partially overlap with z, as long as the overlapping region doesn't include y (since DC(y,z)).

4. TPP(x,z) - This is possible. x could be a tangential proper part of z, as long as y remains outside of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This is possible. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, as long as y remains outside of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This is possible. z could be a tangential proper part of x, as long as z doesn't overlap with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This is possible. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, as long as z doesn't overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - This is not possible. If x and z were equal, and EC(x,y), then we would have EC(z,y), which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me double check my reasoning.

Let's go through each relation again:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. This is possible. x could be adjacent to y, and z could be disconnected from y, and x and z could also be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at the boundary. This is possible. x could touch y at one part of its boundary, and touch z at another part of its boundary, while y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x could overlap with z in a region that doesn't include y, while x still touches y at the boundary and z remains disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z, but touches z's boundary. This is possible as long as x doesn't bring y into contact with z (which would contradict DC(y,z)). Since EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then y could still be outside of z, maintaining DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems potentially problematic. If x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), then y would have to penetrate into z to touch x. This would contradict DC(y,z).

So, on second thought, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x, but touches x's boundary. This is possible as long as the part of x's boundary where z touches is different from the part where y touches (due to EC(x,y)). In this scenario, y and z remain disconnected, satisfying DC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible. z could be completely inside x, away from its boundary, while y touches x at the boundary, ensuring DC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal. As mentioned earlier, if x and z were equal, and EC(x,y), then we would have EC(z,y), which contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me correct my previous response. The possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually I'm still not being careful enough.

I need to be sure about NTPP(x,z). If NTPP(x,z), then x is contained within z without touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. So, y would be touching x's boundary from the outside of x. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y, which touches x's boundary, would also have to enter z to do so. But this would contradict DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's reexamine the others as well:

TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. This is possible if the part of x's boundary where y touches is the same as the part where x touches z's boundary. In this scenario, y and z could still be disconnected, satisfying DC(y,z).

Let me check once again: since x and y touch at x's boundary, and if x is contained within z touching z's boundary at the same place, it's possible y doesn't overlap with z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible as long as the overlap doesn't include y. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. y could touch x's boundary outside of the region where x and z overlap. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary. This is possible. x could touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part, ensuring DC(y,z).

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. x could be adjacent to y, and z could be disconnected from both x and y.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible as long as the part of x's boundary where z touches is different from the part where y touches (due to EC(x,y)). In this scenario, y and z remain disconnected, satisfying DC(y,z).

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z could be completely inside x, away from its boundary, while y touches x at the boundary, ensuring DC(y,z).

Let me visualize these to be more confident:

DC(x,z): x and y touch at boundaries, z is disconnected from both.

OK, except for NTPP(x,z) and EQ(x,z), all other relations between x and z are possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Actually, let me re-check NTPP(x,z) once more, because I'm not certain about my reasoning.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary.

Let me think step by step: 
1. x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
2. y touches x's boundary.
3. For DC(y,z) to be true, y and z should not share any points.

Given that y touches x's boundary and x is inside z, it seems like y would have to penetrate z to touch x. This would contradict DC(y,z).

Let me try to visualize this:
      /----------\
     /            \
    /    /----\    \

                 \
                  \
                   y

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. For this to be consistent with DC(y,z), y should touch x's boundary without entering z.

But if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, any point that touches x's boundary must be inside z. This means y would have to be inside z to touch x's boundary. But this contradicts DC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Actually, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) as well.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary.

For this to be consistent with DC(y,z), y should touch x's boundary at a point where x also touches z's boundary. But if y touches x at this point, and x touches z at the same point, then y might also be touching z. But DC(y,z) means y and z don't share any points.

Let me look more carefully. Imagine x as a small circle inside a larger circle z, with x touching the boundary of z at a single point. Now, y is another circle outside of z that touches x at the exact point where x touches z. In this scenario, y would also be touching z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is also not possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me recheck my reasoning for TPP(x,z) by visualizing:

In 2D, if a region x is a tangential proper part of region z, then x is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Let's say x touches z's boundary at point p. If y also touches x at point p (which is allowed by EC(x,y)), then y would also be touching z at point p. But DC(y,z) means y and z don't share any points, so this is a contradiction.

But what if y touches x at a different point q, where x doesn't touch z's boundary? In this case, q would be inside z (since x is inside z except at point p). For y to touch x at point q, y would need to penetrate into z, which would mean y and z share some points. But this contradicts DC(y,z).

So, regardless of where y touches x, if TPP(x,z), there's a contradiction with DC(y,z).

Actually, no, that's not quite right. Let me be more careful.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
DC(y,z): y and z don't share any points.

The scenario to consider is: If y touches x at a point where x also touches z's boundary, would y also be touching z?

Actually, I think I was being too rigid in my visualization. In continuous space, the boundaries of x, y, and z can be shaped in various ways.

If x touches z's boundary at point p, and y touches x's boundary at a different point q, then y doesn't have to enter z to touch x. Instead, y could be positioned so that it touches x from the outside of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

But wait, let me check again with a more specific visualization:

If x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x is inside z except for a point (or a line or a region) on its boundary that also lies on z's boundary. Let's call this shared boundary point (or line or region) p.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Let's consider the different possibilities:

1. If y touches x at point p (or any part of p), then y would also be touching z's boundary. This would contradict DC(y,z).

2. If y touches x at a different point q on x's boundary, then q is inside z (since x is inside z except at p). For y to touch x at q, y would need to penetrate into z, which would mean y and z share some points. But this contradicts DC(y,z).

So, it seems like TPP(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Actually, no. I'm being too strict in my reasoning again. Let's be more clear.

In TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This doesn't mean x is "almost" completely inside z; it just means x touches z's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. The constraint is that y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)).

If x touches z's boundary at a specific region or point, and y touches x's boundary at a different region or point, then y doesn't necessarily have to enter z to touch x. It's possible for y to be positioned in such a way that it touches x from the outside of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible, but we need to be careful about where y touches x to ensure DC(y,z).

Actually, I think I've been making a conceptual error. In the RCC-8 calculus, when we say a region is "inside" another region, we mean it's a proper part of that region. When we say a region "touches" another region, we mean they share boundary points but no interior points.

Given this understanding, let's revisit TPP(x,z):

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is a proper part of z (i.e., every point of x is also a point of z) and x shares some boundary points with z.
EC(x,y): x and y share some boundary points but no interior points.
DC(y,z): y and z don't share any points.

Given TPP(x,z), x is entirely contained within z, and some part of x's boundary is also part of z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y shares some boundary points with x. The question is: can y share boundary points with x without sharing any points with z?

If y shares a boundary point with x, and that point is also a boundary point of z (due to TPP(x,z)), then y would also share a boundary point with z. This would contradict DC(y,z).

But TPP(x,z) doesn't imply that all of x's boundary is also z's boundary. Only some part of x's boundary is also part of z's boundary. So, if y touches x at a part of x's boundary that isn't also z's boundary, y doesn't have to touch z.

But then, if x is a proper part of z, and a point p is on x's boundary, then p is either also on z's boundary or in z's interior. If p is in z's interior, and y touches x at p, then y would have to penetrate into z, which would contradict DC(y,z).

So, for TPP(x,z) to be possible, y must touch x at a point on x's boundary that's also on z's boundary, but in a way that y doesn't touch z. This seems impossible.

Let me try once more with a concrete example: 

Imagine x as a small circle, z as a larger circle, and x is tangent to z from the inside. Let's say x touches z at point p. Now, y could be a circle outside of z that's tangent to x at a different point q. In this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of z, x and y are externally connected, and y and z are disconnected.

Wait, that doesn't work. If x is tangent to z from the inside, and y is tangent to x from the outside, then y would have to intersect with z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

I think the issue here is that TPP(x,z) and EC(x,y) together imply that y and z must share at least one point, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me re-verify the remaining:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. x could be adjacent to y, and z could be disconnected from both x and y.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary. This is possible. x could touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part, ensuring DC(y,z).

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This seems problematic. If x and z overlap, then there are points in the interior of x that are also in the interior of z. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. For DC(y,z) to be true, y must not touch z at all. But if y touches x's boundary, and some of x's interior is also z's interior, can we guarantee that y doesn't intersect with z?

Actually, I think PO(x,z) is possible. Just because x and z partially overlap doesn't mean y has to intersect with z. y touches x's boundary at some point, and as long as that point isn't in the overlapping region of x and z, y doesn't have to touch z. The overlapping region of x and z are the points that are in both x and z, and y can avoid this region.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible as long as the part of x's boundary where z touches is different from the part where y touches (due to EC(x,y)). In this scenario, y and z remain disconnected, satisfying DC(y,z).

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z could be completely inside x, away from its boundary, while y touches x at the boundary, ensuring DC(y,z).

OK, so TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible. But DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

Let me recheck TPP(x,z) to make sure I'm reasoning correctly:

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected.
DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained within z, and x touches z's boundary at some point p. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary at some point. 

If y touches x at a point that's not p, then that point is in the interior of z (since x is entirely contained within z except at p). For y to touch x at this point, y would have to penetrate into z, which would contradict DC(y,z).

If y touches x at point p, then y would also be touching z at p (since p is on z's boundary), which would contradict DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Actually, I need to be more careful about RCC-8's exact definition. Let me go over the definitions again:

EC(x,y): x and y share some boundary points but no interior points.
TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z (every point of x is a point of z) and x shares some boundary points with z.
DC(y,z): y and z don't share any points.

If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained within z, but x touches z's boundary at some points. These points are on both x's boundary and z's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. If y touches x at a point where x also touches z's boundary, then y would also be touching z's boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z).

If y touches x at a point where x doesn't touch z's boundary, then that point is in the interior of z (since x is entirely contained within z except at the points where x touches z's boundary). For y to touch x at this point, y would have to penetrate into z, which would contradict DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

In fact, I think I was being too abstract in my earlier reasoning. Let's consider it purely in terms of points:

Let's say we have a point p that's on x's boundary. Given TPP(x,z), if p is also on z's boundary, then if y touches x at p, y would also be touching z at p, which would contradict DC(y,z).

If p is not on z's boundary, then p is in the interior of z. If y touches x at p, then y would also be penetrating into z, which would contradict DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Since x doesn't touch z's boundary, any point on x's boundary is in the interior of z. For y to touch x's boundary, y would have to penetrate into z, which would contradict DC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

After careful reconsideration, I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, actually let me be even more careful, especially about PO(x,z), since I was uncertain about it.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means there are points that are in both x and z, but there are also points in x that are not in z, and points in z that are not in x.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. For DC(y,z) to be true, y must not touch z at all.

When x and z partially overlap, the boundary of x can be divided into two parts: one that's inside z and one that's outside z. If y touches x's boundary at a point that's inside z, then y would also be penetrating into z, which would contradict DC(y,z). So, y must touch x's boundary at a point that's outside z.

Is this possible? Yes, since PO(x,z) means there are parts of x that are not in z. y can touch x's boundary at a point in one of these parts.

So, PO(x,z) is possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's double check the rest:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. x could be adjacent to y, and z could be disconnected from both x and y.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary. This is possible. x could touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part, ensuring DC(y,z).

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x, but z touches x's boundary at some points. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. As long as y touches x's boundary at points where z doesn't touch x's boundary, y and z can remain disconnected.

This is possible, so TPPi(x,z) is possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Since z doesn't touch x's boundary, y and z can remain disconnected.

This is possible, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

After careful reconsideration, I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me recheck PO(x,z) one more time:

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means there are points that are in both x and z, but there are also points in x that are not in z, and points in z that are not in x.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. For DC(y,z) to be true, y must not touch z at all.

When x and z partially overlap, the boundary of x can be divided into three parts: one that's inside z, one that's outside z, and one that coincides with z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary at a point that's inside z, then y would also be penetrating into z, which would contradict DC(y,z). If y touches x's boundary at a point that coincides with z's boundary, then y would also be touching z's boundary, which would contradict DC(y,z). So, y must touch x's boundary at a point that's outside z.

Is this possible? Yes, since PO(x,z) means there are parts of x that are not in z. y can touch x's boundary at a point in one of these parts.

So, PO(x,z) is possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

OK, so the possible relations are:

1. DC(x,z) - This is possible. x can be adjacent to y, and z can be disconnected from both x and y.
2. EC(x,z) - This is possible. x can touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part, ensuring DC(y,z).
3. PO(x,z) - This is possible. x can partially overlap with z, and y can touch x's boundary at a point that's outside z, ensuring DC(y,z).
4. TPPi(x,z) - This is possible. z can be tangentially part of x, and y can touch x's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary, ensuring DC(y,z).
5. NTPPi(x,z) - This is possible. z can be a non-tangential part of x, and y can touch x's boundary, ensuring DC(y,z).

Let me double-check if there are any other relations I should consider:

6. TPP(x,z) - This is not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then any point on x's boundary is either on z's boundary or inside z. If y touches x's boundary at a point that's on z's boundary, y would also be touching z's boundary, which would contradict DC(y,z). If y touches x's boundary at a point that's inside z, y would be penetrating into z, which would contradict DC(y,z).

7. NTPP(x,z) - This is not possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then any point on x's boundary is inside z. If y touches x's boundary, y would be penetrating into z, which would contradict DC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - This is not possible. If x and z are equal, and EC(x,y), then EC(z,y), which contradicts DC(y,z).

After comprehensive review, I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just check that I'm not missing EQ(x,z):

If EQ(x,z) - then x and z are identical. Given EC(x,y), x and y share boundary points. If x and z are identical, then z and y also share boundary points, which would be EC(z,y). But we're given DC(y,z), which contradicts EC(z,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

To summarize, the relationships that are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to find all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me analyze each potential relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at the boundary while both x and z remain completely disconnected from each other.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part, with y and z remaining disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z while touching y at a portion of its boundary that's outside z, ensuring y and z remain disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then any point on x's boundary is either on z's boundary or inside z. If y touches x's boundary (required by EC(x,y)), it would either touch z's boundary or penetrate into z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would have to penetrate into z to touch x's boundary, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be tangentially contained within x, with y touching x at a different part of its boundary, keeping y and z disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, while y touches x at its boundary, ensuring y and z remain disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are identical, then EC(x,y) would imply EC(z,y), contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
