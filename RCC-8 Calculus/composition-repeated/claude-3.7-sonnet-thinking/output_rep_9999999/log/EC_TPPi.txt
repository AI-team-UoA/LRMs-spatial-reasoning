PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason carefully about this problem. We have the following:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think about what these conditions tell us about the relative positions of x, y, and z.

From EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at a boundary, but they don't overlap in any interior part.

From TPPi(y,z), which is TPP(z,y), we know that z is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary.

So z is inside y, and x is outside y but touching y's boundary. 

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since z touches y's boundary and x also touches y's boundary, one possibility is that x and z touch at the boundary. In this case, we would have EC(x,z).

Another possibility is that x and z are completely disjoint and don't touch. This would happen if x and z touch y's boundary at different places. In this case, we would have DC(x,z).

Let's also check if there could be any other possible relationships:

1. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since x is outside y and z is inside y, x and z cannot overlap, so PO(x,z) is not possible.

2. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since x is outside y and z is inside y, x cannot be inside z, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But since x is outside y and z is inside y, x cannot be inside z, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since z is inside y and x is outside y, z cannot be inside x, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But since z is inside y and x is outside y, z cannot be inside x, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since x is outside y and z is inside y, they cannot be the same, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect (touch at a boundary).

Let's double-check my reasoning.

From EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. From TPPi(y,z), or TPP(z,y), z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary. 

So x touches y's boundary from the outside, and z touches y's boundary from the inside.

Depending on whether x and z touch the same part of y's boundary, they could either be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC).

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, wait a minute. Let me rethink this. The condition TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y.

Actually, let me be even more precise. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is entirely contained within z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Given that EC(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. So x touches y, and y is within z, touching the boundary of z.

Now, what could be the relationship between x and z?

Since y is entirely within z, and x touches y, x must also touch z or possibly overlap with z.

Let's see:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since x touches y and y is within z (touching z's boundary), x must also touch or overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary. Given that x touches y, and y is entirely within z (touching z's boundary), x could touch z at the same point where y touches z. So EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. Given that x touches y, and y is entirely within z, x could overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that x touches y, and y is entirely within z, x could be entirely within z as well, touching z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would happen if x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary. But since x touches y, and y touches z's boundary, x would also touch z's boundary or be outside z. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since y is entirely within z, and x touches y, z cannot be entirely within x. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. As with TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since y is a proper part of z, and x touches y, x and z cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. I'm not completely sure about this, since the description says that TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), which would mean that TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). Let me try to clarify this.

According to the description:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary. This means y contains z, and z touches the boundary of y.

I think that's the same as what I had above. So, indeed, z is a tangential proper part of y.

Given that x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since x touches y's boundary from the outside, and z touches y's boundary from the inside, x and z might touch at the common boundary point, or they might touch different parts of y's boundary.

If they touch at the same point of y's boundary, then they are externally connected, giving us EC(x,z).

If they touch different parts of y's boundary, then they are disconnected, giving us DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let me check my reasoning once more. TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is inside y, touching y's boundary. On the other hand, EC(x,y) means x is outside y, touching y's boundary. So, x is outside y, and z is inside y, both touching y's boundary. The possible relationships are:

1. DC(x,z): This happens if x and z touch different parts of y's boundary, so they don't connect.
2. EC(x,z): This happens if x and z touch the same part of y's boundary, so they externally connect.

Since TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, and this is a problem.

Actually, let me be super clear. We have:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.

So TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So the condition "TPPi(y,z)" means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

With this clarification, let's reconsider the problem.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now, we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since z is a proper part of y, z is completely contained within y. And since x is externally connected to y, x touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, z touches y's boundary. So, x and z might touch at the common boundary point of y, or they might not.

If they touch at the common boundary point of y, then they are externally connected, giving us EC(x,z).

If they don't touch at the common boundary point of y, then they are disconnected, giving us DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I am making a mistake in my understanding. TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), meaning it's TPP(z,y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y. So my understanding that z is a tangential proper part of y is correct.

Actually, from the problem statement I have:
"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

So TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. This matches my understanding.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

To determine the relationship between x and z, let's visualize:
- y contains z, and z touches y's boundary.
- x is outside y but touches y's boundary.

The possible relationships are:
1. DC(x,z): This happens if x and z touch different parts of y's boundary, so they don't connect.
2. EC(x,z): This happens if x and z touch the same part of y's boundary, so they externally connect.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me make absolutely sure my understanding of the problem is correct.

From the problem statement:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. So, x is outside y but touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since x touches y's boundary from the outside and z touches y's boundary from the inside, they might touch at the same point or at different points.

If they touch at the same point, they are externally connected, giving us EC(x,z).
If they touch at different points, they are disconnected, giving us DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

But wait... let me think more. Actually, we have:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

Actually I think I've been going back and forth between different interpretations of TPPi. Let me re-read the problem statement:

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

Given this, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So here's the situation:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. So, x is outside y but touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

If x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since x touches y's boundary from the outside and z touches y's boundary from the inside, they can either touch at the same part of y's boundary or at different parts.

If they touch at the same part of y's boundary, they are externally connected, giving us EC(x,z).
If they touch at different parts of y's boundary, they are disconnected, giving us DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let me do a final check. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y externally connect. This means x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): According to the problem, TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y). So, z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, there are two possibilities:
1. x and z touch at the same point on y's boundary, giving us EC(x,z).
2. x and z touch different parts of y's boundary, giving us DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, here's one more check to clarify the relationship between y and z.

According to the problem statement:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Alright, now I'm really sure. Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me try yet another interpretation in which TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So this would mean y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. So, x is outside y but touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, y is inside z, x is outside y, and x touches y's boundary. What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary from the outside, x must touch z's boundary or possibly be inside z (if z extends beyond y in the direction of x).

Let's explore the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then they don't touch. But since x touches y, and y touches z's boundary, x must at least touch z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z externally connect, then x touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. Given that x touches y, and y touches z's boundary, it's possible that x also touches z's boundary but doesn't go inside z. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then they share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. Given that x touches y but doesn't overlap with y, and y is inside z, it's possible that x overlaps with z but not with y. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, it's possible that x is also inside z and touches z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y, and y touches z's boundary, if x is inside z, it would touch z's boundary at the same point where y touches it. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. But since y is inside z, and x touches y but doesn't overlap with y, z cannot be completely contained within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. As with TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. But since y is inside z, and x touches y but doesn't overlap with y, x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

So, if TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(x,z).

But I've been told that TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. With this interpretation, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I'm going to go with this interpretation (the one from the problem statement), and thus the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, I think my confusion stems from the wording. Let me read the problem statement again.

"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary."
"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y, or in other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. So, x is outside y but touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me read the problem statement one more time, and let's get 100% clear on what TPPi means:

"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

So TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). We have:
- TPP(z,y) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Wait wait wait. There's a more fundamental issue that I'm mixing up, which is what the "i" in TPPi means. The "i" stands for "inverse".

From the problem statement:
"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary."
"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

So, if TPP(x,y) means x is part of y, then TPPi(x,y) means y is part of x. It's the inverse of the relation.

Given this, let's reinterpret:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, z is inside y and touches y's boundary, while x is outside y and touches y's boundary. They can either touch at the same point on y's boundary, giving us EC(x,z), or they can touch different points, giving us DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Here's the final reasoning:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

To determine the relationship between x and z, we visualize:
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- x is outside y but touches y's boundary.

Since x touches y's boundary from the outside and z touches y's boundary from the inside, they can either touch at the same point on y's boundary or at different points:
- If they touch at the same point, they are externally connected, giving us EC(x,z).
- If they touch at different points, they are disconnected, giving us DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let me see if I can derive any more possible relationships though, just to be thorough.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then they don't touch. This is possible if x and z touch different parts of y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z externally connect, then they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible if x and z touch the same point on y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then they share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. But since x is outside y and z is inside y, they can't overlap, so PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. But since x is outside y and z is inside y, x can't be inside z, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. As with TPP(x,z), this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. But since z is inside y and x is outside y, z can't be inside x, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. As with TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. But since z is inside y and x is outside y, they can't be the same region, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z). There are no other relationships that I can derive here.

So, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

To summarize once more:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

From these conditions, x is outside y and touches y's boundary, while z is inside y and touches y's boundary. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): If x and z touch different parts of y's boundary, they are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): If x and z touch the same point on y's boundary, they are externally connected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

So to conclude, the possible relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z) (disconnected)
- EC(x,z) (externally connected)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to reason about the spatial arrangements that can satisfy both given conditions.

From the information provided:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

Given these conditions:
- x is outside of y, touching y's boundary
- z is inside y, also touching y's boundary

When we consider the possible relationships between x and z, there are two possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z touch different parts of y's boundary, they will be disconnected from each other
2. EC(x,z): If x and z touch the same point on y's boundary, they will be externally connected

No other RCC-8 relation is possible between x and z in this scenario, as x must be outside y while z must be inside y.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
