PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what the possible relationships are between x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's start by understanding what these given relations mean:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is a part of y and touches y's boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, which means they share no spatial parts.

Now, I need to determine which of the RCC-8 relations could possibly hold between x and z. The RCC-8 relations are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (they touch at a boundary).
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

Given that TPP(x,y), x is completely contained within y, touching y's boundary. And given that DC(y,z), y and z are completely disconnected.

Let's analyze each potential relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Since x is entirely within y, and y is disconnected from z, it follows that x must also be disconnected from z. This is a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, they must touch at a boundary. Since x is entirely within y, the only way x could touch z is if x touches y's boundary at exactly the point where y might touch z. But since y and z are disconnected (DC), y and z don't touch at all. So, x cannot touch z either. This is not a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they must share a spatial part. But since x is entirely within y, and y is disconnected from z, x cannot share any part with z. This is not a valid possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary. But since x is entirely within y, and y is disconnected from z, x cannot be contained within z. This is not a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary. But since x is entirely within y, and y is disconnected from z, x cannot be contained within z. This is not a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary. But since z is disconnected from y, and x is entirely within y, z cannot be contained within x. This is not a valid possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary. But since z is disconnected from y, and x is entirely within y, z cannot be contained within x. This is not a valid possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they must be the same region. But since x is entirely within y, and y is disconnected from z, x and z cannot be the same region. This is not a valid possibility.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means that x and z are disconnected.

Actually, let me double-check this. I'm assuming that the spatial part is a two-dimensional region, and TPP(x,y) means that the region x is entirely within the region y, with its boundary touching the boundary of y.

If y and z are disconnected, then they don't share any spatial parts and don't touch at a boundary. Given that x is entirely within y, and y doesn't share any part with z, it's clear that x cannot share any part with z either. Furthermore, since y doesn't touch z at a boundary, and x is inside y touching y's boundary, x cannot touch z at a boundary either. Thus, x and z must be disconnected.

The answer is: DC(x,z).

Hmm, let me think through this again to be sure. Let's be even more careful.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is entirely within y, and x's boundary touches y's boundary at at least one point.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. This means they don't share any interior points and their boundaries don't touch.

Now, since x is entirely contained within y, and y is disconnected from z, it follows that x is disconnected from z as well. The boundary of x might touch the boundary of y, but since the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of z, the boundary of x can't touch the boundary of z either.

So, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, actually, let's be even more cautious and consider the case where x touches the boundary of y. In the RCC-8 calculus, the boundary of a region is not itself a region, so "touching the boundary" doesn't mean they share parts, but rather that the closure of one region intersects the closure of the other.

So, when we say TPP(x,y), it means that x is contained within y, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y at some point. And when we say DC(y,z), it means that y and z don't share any parts, including their boundaries.

Given this, if x touches the boundary of y at some point p, and y doesn't touch z at any point, then x definitely doesn't touch z at the point p. In fact, since x is entirely within y, and y is disconnected from z, x is also disconnected from z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, no, I should be more precise and rigorous. Let's be even more careful.

In the RCC-8 calculus, regions are regular closed sets. 

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, which means the closures of y and z are disjoint.

Now, let's check each of the RCC-8 relations to see if they can hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): 
   For DC(x,z) to hold, the closures of x and z must be disjoint.
   Since TPP(x,y), the closure of x is a subset of the closure of y. 
   Since DC(y,z), the closures of y and z are disjoint.
   Therefore, the closures of x and z are also disjoint.
   So, DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z): 
   For EC(x,z) to hold, the interiors of x and z must be disjoint, but their boundaries must touch.
   Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y.
   Since DC(y,z), the closures of y and z are disjoint, meaning their boundaries don't touch.
   Since the boundary of x touches the boundary of y, but the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of z, the boundary of x can't touch the boundary of z.
   Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z):
   For PO(x,z) to hold, the interiors of x and z must overlap, but neither is a subset of the other.
   Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y.
   Since DC(y,z), the interiors of y and z are disjoint.
   Therefore, the interiors of x and z are also disjoint, so they can't overlap.
   Thus, PO(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

4. TPP(x,z):
   For TPP(x,z) to hold, the interior of x must be a subset of the interior of z, and the boundary of x must touch the boundary of z.
   Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y.
   Since DC(y,z), the interiors of y and z are disjoint.
   Therefore, the interior of x is disjoint from the interior of z, so x's interior can't be a subset of z's interior.
   Thus, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   For NTPP(x,z) to hold, the interior of x must be a subset of the interior of z, and the boundary of x must not touch the boundary of z.
   As established earlier, the interior of x is disjoint from the interior of z.
   Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   For TPPi(x,z) to hold, the interior of z must be a subset of the interior of x, and the boundary of z must touch the boundary of x.
   Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y.
   Since DC(y,z), the interiors of y and z are disjoint.
   This implies that the interiors of x and z are also disjoint, so the interior of z can't be a subset of the interior of x.
   Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, the interior of z must be a subset of the interior of x, and the boundary of z must not touch the boundary of x.
   As established earlier, the interiors of x and z are disjoint.
   Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

8. EQ(x,z):
   For EQ(x,z) to hold, the interiors of x and z must be equal, and their boundaries must also be equal.
   Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y.
   Since DC(y,z), the interiors of y and z are disjoint.
   Therefore, the interiors of x and z are also disjoint, so they can't be equal.
   Thus, EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hold on, I need to be careful here. Let's define the RCC-8 relations more explicitly:

1. DC(x,y): The regions x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): The regions x and y are externally connected.
3. PO(x,y): The regions x and y partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,y): The region x is a tangential proper part of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): The region x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): The region y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): The region y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): The regions x and y are equal.

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), let's consider each of the possible relations between x and z:

For DC(x,z) to hold, x and z should be disconnected. Since x is entirely within y (as given by TPP(x,y)), and y is disconnected from z (as given by DC(y,z)), it follows that x is also disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z should be externally connected, meaning their boundaries touch but their interiors don't intersect. Since y is disconnected from z, and x is entirely within y, the boundary of x cannot touch the boundary of z. So, EC(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z should partially overlap, meaning they share some interior points but neither is contained in the other. Since y is disconnected from z, and x is entirely within y, x and z cannot share any interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x should be a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely within z and their boundaries touch. Since x is entirely within y and y is disconnected from z, x cannot be within z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x should be a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely within z and their boundaries don't touch. As established, x cannot be within z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z should be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely within x and their boundaries touch. Since x is entirely within y and y is disconnected from z, z cannot be within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z should be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely within x and their boundaries don't touch. As established, z cannot be within x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z should be equal, meaning they occupy the same space. Since x is entirely within y and y is disconnected from z, x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more precise. I'll use the standard definitions of the RCC-8 relations in terms of point set topology, which define the relations using the concepts of interior, closure, and boundary.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): The interior of x is a subset of the interior of y, the interiors of x and y are not equal, and the boundaries of x and y intersect.
- DC(y,z): The closures of y and z are disjoint, meaning there are no points in common between the closures of y and z.

For DC(x,z) to hold, the closures of x and z should be disjoint. Since TPP(x,y), the closure of x is a subset of the closure of y. Since DC(y,z), the closures of y and z are disjoint. It follows that the closures of x and z are also disjoint. So, DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For EC(x,z) to hold, the closures of x and z should intersect, but their interiors should be disjoint. Since the closure of x is a subset of the closure of y, and the closures of y and z are disjoint, the closures of x and z are also disjoint. Thus, EC(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For PO(x,z) to hold, the interiors of x and z should intersect, but neither interior should be a subset of the other. Since the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y, and the interiors of y and z are disjoint, the interiors of x and z are also disjoint. Thus, PO(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, the interior of x should be a subset of the interior of z, the interiors of x and z should not be equal, and the boundaries of x and z should intersect. Since the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y, and the interiors of y and z are disjoint, the interior of x is disjoint from the interior of z. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, the interior of x should be a subset of the interior of z, and the closures of x and z should not be equal, and the boundary of x should not intersect the boundary of z. As established, the interior of x is disjoint from the interior of z. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, the interior of z should be a subset of the interior of x, the interiors of x and z should not be equal, and the boundaries of x and z should intersect. Since the interiors of x and z are disjoint, the interior of z is not a subset of the interior of x. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, the interior of z should be a subset of the interior of x, the closures of x and z should not be equal, and the boundary of z should not intersect the boundary of x. As established, the interiors of x and z are disjoint. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, the interiors of x and z should be equal, and the boundaries of x and z should also be equal. Since the interiors of x and z are disjoint, they cannot be equal. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Oh wait, I've been overthinking this. Let's go back to the RCC-8 calculus and its composition table. The composition of TPP and DC should give the possible relations between x and z.

In the RCC-8 composition table, the result of composing TPP and DC is DC. This means that if TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), then the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

To verify this, consider the fact that TPP(x,y) means x is entirely within y, touching y's boundary. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts. Since x is entirely within y, and y shares no parts with z, it follows that x also shares no parts with z. Thus, x and z are disconnected, which is the relation DC(x,z).

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, I need to be fully certain. Let's just double-check using the mathematical definition of RCC-8 based on point set topology. The standard definition using point set topology defines the RCC-8 relations as follows:

1. DC(x,y): The regions x and y are disconnected if their closures are disjoint, i.e., C(x) ∩ C(y) = ∅, where C(x) is the closure of x.
2. EC(x,y): The regions x and y are externally connected if their closures intersect but their interiors are disjoint, i.e., C(x) ∩ C(y) ≠ ∅ and I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅, where I(x) is the interior of x.
3. PO(x,y): The regions x and y partially overlap if their interiors intersect, but neither is a subset of the other, i.e., I(x) ∩ I(y) ≠ ∅, I(x) ⊈ I(y), and I(y) ⊈ I(x).
4. TPP(x,y): The region x is a tangential proper part of y if the interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and the closure of x intersects the boundary of y, i.e., I(x) ⊂ I(y) and C(x) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅, where B(y) is the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): The region x is a non-tangential proper part of y if the closure of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, i.e., C(x) ⊂ I(y).
6. TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP, i.e., TPP(y,x).
7. NTPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of NTPP, i.e., NTPP(y,x).
8. EQ(x,y): The regions x and y are equal if their interiors and boundaries are equal, i.e., I(x) = I(y) and B(x) = B(y).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): I(x) ⊂ I(y) and C(x) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅
- DC(y,z): C(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅

Now, let's check what relation holds between x and z:

For DC(x,z), we need to check if C(x) ∩ C(z) = ∅.
From TPP(x,y), we know that C(x) ⊂ C(y).
From DC(y,z), we know that C(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅.

Given that C(x) ⊂ C(y) and C(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅, it follows that C(x) ∩ C(z) = ∅. Therefore, DC(x,z) holds.

This confirms that the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

So, the answer is that if TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), then the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, hold on. I've been assuming the composition table. Let me see if there are any other possible relations I'm missing.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): I(x) ⊂ I(y) and C(x) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅
- DC(y,z): C(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅

I need to check each of the RCC-8 relations to see if they can hold between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): The regions x and z are disconnected if C(x) ∩ C(z) = ∅.
   From TPP(x,y), we know that C(x) ⊂ C(y).
   From DC(y,z), we know that C(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅.
   It follows that C(x) ∩ C(z) = ∅.
   Therefore, DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z): The regions x and z are externally connected if C(x) ∩ C(z) ≠ ∅ and I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅.
   From TPP(x,y), we know that C(x) ⊂ C(y).
   From DC(y,z), we know that C(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅.
   It follows that C(x) ∩ C(z) = ∅.
   Since the first condition of EC(x,z) is not met, EC(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z): The regions x and z partially overlap if I(x) ∩ I(z) ≠ ∅, I(x) ⊈ I(z), and I(z) ⊈ I(x).
   From TPP(x,y), we know that I(x) ⊂ I(y).
   From DC(y,z), we know that I(y) ∩ I(z) = ∅.
   It follows that I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅.
   Since the first condition of PO(x,z) is not met, PO(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): The region x is a tangential proper part of z if I(x) ⊂ I(z) and C(x) ∩ B(z) ≠ ∅.
   From TPP(x,y), we know that I(x) ⊂ I(y).
   From DC(y,z), we know that I(y) ∩ I(z) = ∅.
   It follows that I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅, which means I(x) ⊈ I(z).
   Since the first condition of TPP(x,z) is not met, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): The region x is a non-tangential proper part of z if C(x) ⊂ I(z).
   From TPP(x,y), we know that C(x) ⊂ C(y).
   From DC(y,z), we know that C(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅.
   It follows that C(x) ∩ C(z) = ∅, which means C(x) ⊈ I(z).
   Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): The region z is a tangential proper part of x if I(z) ⊂ I(x) and C(z) ∩ B(x) ≠ ∅.
   From TPP(x,y), we know that I(x) ⊂ I(y).
   From DC(y,z), we know that I(y) ∩ I(z) = ∅.
   It follows that I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅, which means I(z) ⊈ I(x).
   Since the first condition of TPPi(x,z) is not met, TPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): The region z is a non-tangential proper part of x if C(z) ⊂ I(x).
   From TPP(x,y), we know that I(x) ⊂ I(y).
   From DC(y,z), we know that C(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅.
   It follows that I(y) ∩ C(z) = ∅, which means I(x) ∩ C(z) = ∅. This implies C(z) ⊈ I(x).
   Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): The regions x and z are equal if I(x) = I(z) and B(x) = B(z).
   From TPP(x,y), we know that I(x) ⊂ I(y) and I(x) ≠ I(y).
   From DC(y,z), we know that I(y) ∩ I(z) = ∅.
   It follows that I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅, which means I(x) ≠ I(z).
   Since the first condition of EQ(x,z) is not met, EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z). And this confirms what I said earlier, and matches the entry in the composition table.

So, the answer is that if TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), then the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

I feel like I'm overthinking this, so let me see if I can provide a simpler argument.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

The question is: What is the relation between x and z?

TPP(x,y) means x is fully contained within y, with x's boundary touching y's boundary. DC(y,z) means y and z are completely disjoint, they don't touch and they don't overlap. 

Given these conditions, and since x is fully contained within y, it's clear that x must also be completely disjoint from z. That is, x and z don't touch and they don't overlap. This corresponds to the relation DC(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I think this is the right approach: I'm using the RCC-8 composition table.

Suppose we know two facts:
- TPP(x,y)
- DC(y,z)

The RCC-8 composition table tells us what relations are possible between x and z based on these known facts. The entry in the table for the composition of TPP and DC is just DC. This means that if TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), then the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let's verify this using the definitions of RCC-8 relations:

- TPP(x,y) means x is entirely within y, with x's boundary touching y's boundary.
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, i.e., they don't share any spatial parts and they don't touch.

Given that x is entirely within y, and y is disconnected from z, it follows that x is also disconnected from z. So, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

I'm confident that the correct answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, hold on, let me consider whether there can be other possible relations. I should be systematic and check each one, rather than just relying on my intuition or the composition table.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is properly inside y, with the boundary of x touching the boundary of y at least at one point.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, which means they have no spatial parts in common and don't touch.

Let's check each of the RCC-8 relations to see if they can hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible: since x is entirely within y, and y is disconnected from z, it follows that x is also disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, which means they touch at a boundary but don't overlap. For this to be possible, there would need to be a point on the boundary of x that's also on the boundary of z. Since TPP(x,y), the boundary of x can only touch the boundary of y. Since DC(y,z), the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, the boundary of x can't touch the boundary of z. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, which means they share some but not all parts. For this to be possible, there would need to be a point in the interior of x that's also in the interior of z. Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is entirely within the interior of y. Since DC(y,z), the interior of y doesn't overlap with the interior of z. So, the interior of x can't overlap with the interior of z. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is properly inside z, with the boundary of x touching the boundary of z. For this to be possible, the interior of x would need to be entirely within the interior of z, and the boundary of x would need to touch the boundary of z. Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is entirely within the interior of y. Since DC(y,z), the interior of y doesn't overlap with the interior of z. So, the interior of x can't be within the interior of z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is properly inside z, without the boundary of x touching the boundary of z. As established earlier, the interior of x can't be within the interior of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is properly inside x, with the boundary of z touching the boundary of x. For this to be possible, the interior of z would need to be entirely within the interior of x, and the boundary of z would need to touch the boundary of x. Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is entirely within the interior of y. Since DC(y,z), the interior of y doesn't overlap with the interior of z. So, the interior of z can't be within the interior of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is properly inside x, without the boundary of z touching the boundary of x. As established earlier, the interior of z can't be within the interior of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal, which means they have the same interior and boundary. For this to be possible, the interior of x would need to be the same as the interior of z, and the boundary of x would need to be the same as the boundary of z. Since TPP(x,y), the interior of x is entirely within the interior of y. Since DC(y,z), the interior of y doesn't overlap with the interior of z. So, the interior of x can't be the same as the interior of z. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z). This confirms the result from the RCC-8 composition table.

So, if TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), then the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step using the RCC-8 spatial relations.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no spatial parts)

I need to determine what relationship(s) can hold between x and z.

Since TPP(x,y), the region x is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary at some point(s). Since DC(y,z), regions y and z are completely disconnected - they don't overlap and don't even touch at a boundary point.

Let's check if any of the eight RCC-8 relations could possibly hold between x and z:

- DC(x,z): Since x is completely contained within y, and y is disconnected from z, it follows that x must also be disconnected from z.
- EC(x,z): Not possible because x cannot touch z's boundary when y and z are disconnected.
- PO(x,z): Not possible because x and z cannot share any parts when y and z are disconnected.
- TPP(x,z): Not possible because x cannot be contained in z when x is contained in y and y is disconnected from z.
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z cannot be contained in x when z is disconnected from y.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because x and z cannot be equal when x is contained in y and y is disconnected from z.
