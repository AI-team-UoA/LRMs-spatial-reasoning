PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully think through this problem by analyzing what the given relations tell us and then considering all possible configurations.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z, meaning y and z share some common part, but neither is contained in the other.

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with the given constraints:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   Can x be completely disconnected from z? 
   We know x is inside y, and y partially overlaps with z.
   If the overlap between y and z doesn't include any part of x, then x and z could be disconnected.
   So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   Can x touch the boundary of z without sharing interior?
   Since x is NTPP to y, x doesn't touch y's boundary.
   If z touches x at exactly the points where x is close to (but not touching) y's boundary, this might be possible.
   But actually, since x is NTPP to y, there's a "buffer zone" between x and the boundary of y.
   If z shares parts with y but only touches x, that would mean z penetrates through this buffer zone just enough to touch x but not contain any part of it, which seems geometrically impossible.
   So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider this more carefully. If z penetrates y and touches x exactly at x's boundary without sharing any interior with x, then EC(x,z) would be satisfied. So EC(x,z) might be possible after all.

But I need to be careful here. Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y with some distance from y's boundary. For z to touch x without overlapping, z would need to reach inside y exactly to touch x's boundary and no further. This seems geometrically possible, so EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   Can x and z share some common part, but neither is contained in the other?
   Since x is inside y, and z overlaps with y, it's possible that z overlaps with the region where x is.
   So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   Can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   Since x is NTPP to y, x doesn't touch y's boundary.
   If z extends beyond y in some regions, and x touches z's boundary inside y, this is possible.
   So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
   If z contains all of x and extends beyond x in all directions, this is possible.
   So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse:
   Can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   Since y partially overlaps z, z is not completely inside y.
   But x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)).
   So z cannot be completely inside x, making TPPi(x,z) impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse:
   Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   By the same reasoning as for TPPi, this is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   Can x and z be equal?
   If x and z are equal, then z is completely inside y (since x is).
   But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that neither y nor z is contained in the other.
   So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Hmm, but wait. Let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi and NTPPi:

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. If z were completely inside x, then z would also be completely inside y. But PO(y,z) says that z partially overlaps y, meaning z is neither completely inside y nor completely outside y. Therefore, z cannot be completely inside x, so TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. By the same reasoning, this is impossible given the constraints.

Let me reason about this differently. We know:
- NTPP(x,y): x is fully inside y with a "buffer" from y's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other

The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): If the overlapping region between y and z doesn't include any part of x, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): If z reaches inside y just enough to touch x's boundary but not overlap with x's interior, then x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): If z overlaps with part of x but not all of it, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): If z contains all of x and x touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): If z contains all of x and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would require z to be part of x or equal to x, which contradicts PO(y,z) given that NTPP(x,y).

Actually, I'm not completely confident about TPP(x,z). Let me think more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary. If z extends beyond y's boundary in some regions, it's still possible for x to touch z's boundary from inside. 

Actually, let me revisit TPP(x,z) again. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But we know from NTPP(x,y) that x is completely inside y with some distance from y's boundary. For x to touch z's boundary, z's boundary must penetrate into y and reach x. This is geometrically possible, so TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

Now, let me double-check EC(x,z) once more. For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must share a boundary point without sharing any interior points. Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y with some distance from y's boundary. For z to touch x without overlapping, z would need to penetrate into y just enough to touch x's boundary but not go further. This is geometrically possible, so EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait. I think I need to revisit my reasoning about EC(x,z).

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must share a boundary point without sharing any interior points. Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y with some distance from y's boundary. 

If we have NTPP(x,y), it means there's a "buffer zone" between x and y's boundary. 

Now, for PO(y,z), there are parts of z that are outside y, parts of y that are outside z, and a non-empty intersection between y and z.

For z to externally connect with x (EC(x,z)), z must penetrate y enough to touch x's boundary but not go further into x. This is geometrically possible.

So, EC(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

Let me double-check my reasoning for all the other relations again:

1. DC(x,z): If the overlapping region between y and z doesn't include any part of x, then x and z are disconnected. Possible.

2. EC(x,z): If z reaches inside y just enough to touch x's boundary but not overlap with x's interior, then x and z are externally connected. Possible.

3. PO(x,z): If z overlaps with part of x but not all of it, then x and z partially overlap. Possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If z contains all of x and x touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z. Possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If z contains all of x and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. If z were completely inside x, then z would also be completely inside y. But PO(y,z) says that z partially overlaps y, meaning z is neither completely inside y nor completely outside y. Therefore, z cannot be completely inside x, so TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar reasoning as for TPPi(x,z). Impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must be the same region. Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. If z were equal to x, then z would also be completely inside y. But PO(y,z) says that z partially overlaps y, meaning z is neither completely inside y nor completely outside y. Therefore, z cannot be equal to x, so EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I keep going back and forth on EC(x,z). Let me clarify my reasoning once more.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some common part, but neither is contained in the other.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must share a boundary point without sharing any interior points.

Given NTPP(x,y), there's a "buffer zone" between x and y's boundary. For z to externally connect with x, z would need to penetrate this buffer zone just enough to touch x's boundary but not go further. 

This seems geometrically possible. For instance, imagine y as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z as a shape that partially overlaps with y and extends just enough to touch x's boundary without overlapping with x's interior.

So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

With this clarified, the possible relationships between x and z remain:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I believe this is the correct list of possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, my confusion about EC(x,z) probably stemmed from thinking about the two-dimensional case, where it's indeed possible for z to penetrate y just enough to touch x's boundary without overlapping with x's interior. In higher dimensions, this remains possible.

So, to summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I believe this is the correct and complete list.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to consider what relationships are possible between x and z given that NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these relations tell us:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other

Now I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   If the overlap between y and z doesn't include any part of x, then x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   If z penetrates into y just enough to touch x's boundary without overlapping x's interior, this is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   If z overlaps with part of x but not all of it, this relation is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   If z contains all of x and x touches z's boundary, this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   If z completely contains x with some buffer between x and z's boundary, this is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z):
   These are impossible because they would require z to be contained in or equal to x. Since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)) but z is not completely inside y (PO(y,z)), z cannot be contained in or equal to x.
