PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step.

We're given that:
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y), meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z. To do this, I need to think about the spatial relationships between these objects.

From NTPP(x,y), I know that x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary).
From TPPi(y,z), or equivalently TPP(z,y), I know that z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's consider all possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not overlapping with each other. Given that both x and z are within y (with z touching y's boundary), they could be separate.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x touches z's boundary, but they don't share interior points. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary but z does, they could touch each other at z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, if x touches z's boundary, it must be a part of z that doesn't touch y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if z completely contains x and x is still not touching y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But this contradicts what we know about z touching y's boundary, since x doesn't touch y's boundary. So this relation is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But this contradicts what we know about z touching y's boundary, since x doesn't touch y's boundary. So this relation is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z are the same region. But this contradicts the facts that x doesn't touch y's boundary while z does touch y's boundary. So this relation is not possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let me revisit the definitions and think about the constraints more precisely.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y that does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which is the same as TPP(z,y). So z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary.

Let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Since both x and z are parts of y, and both must have some interior points within y, it's possible that they are separate and don't touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Wait, I made an error in my earlier reasoning. I misinterpreted TPPi(y,z). 

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (not the other way around as I incorrectly stated), which is the same as TPP(z,y). So z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary.

Let me redo the analysis:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y that does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary.

So both x and z are proper parts of y. x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z does touch y's boundary.

Given these constraints, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not overlapping with each other.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, z cannot be entirely inside x. So this relation is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, z cannot be entirely inside x. So this relation is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z are the same region. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary and z does, they cannot be the same region. So this relation is not possible.

Actually, let's pause and reread the definitions for RCC-8 more carefully. 

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (the same region).

OK, so I had the correct understanding. Let me carefully revisit the problem.

NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z): same as TPP(z,y), so z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So both x and z are parts of y, with x not touching y's boundary and z touching y's boundary.

Now, let's systematically evaluate all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not overlapping with each other.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x and z partially overlap within y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, z cannot be entirely inside x. So this relation is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, z cannot be entirely inside x. So this relation is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (the same region). This would mean x and z are the same region. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary and z does, they cannot be the same region. So this relation is not possible.

Hmm, I think I need to be even more careful with my reasoning. Let me draw this out more explicitly.

NTPP(x,y): x is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, touching z's boundary. So z is a larger region that contains y, and y touches z's boundary.

Now, if x is inside y, and y is inside z, then x is definitely inside z. But I need to determine whether x touches z's boundary or not.

Given that x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, x would not touch z's boundary either. So x is properly inside z without touching z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, wait a second. I think I've been consistently misinterpreting TPPi(y,z). Let me be very clear about this.

TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So the correct interpretation is:

NTPP(x,y): x is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z): z is properly inside y, touching y's boundary.

Given this, both x and z are inside y. x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z does touch y's boundary.

Now, let's systematically evaluate all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not overlapping with each other.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x and z partially overlap within y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary. For this to be true, z must be completely inside x (which means z doesn't touch y's boundary, contradicting TPPi(y,z)), or z could be inside x in such a way that z touches both x's boundary and y's boundary. The latter scenario is possible.

Ugh, no. Let me think more carefully.

TPPi(y,z) means "y is a tangential proper part of z" which is the inverse of "z is a tangential proper part of y". So TPPi(y,z) means that y is properly inside z and touches z's boundary. That was the correct understanding earlier.

Let me redraw this to be crystal clear:

NTPP(x,y): x is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, touching z's boundary. So z is a larger region that contains y, and y touches z's boundary.

With this understanding, x is inside y, and y is inside z. So x is definitely inside z. The question is: does x touch z's boundary?

Given that x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, x would not touch z's boundary either. So x is properly inside z without touching z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think again. We have:

NTPP(x,y): x is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, touching z's boundary.

It's possible that x, while not touching y's boundary, could potentially touch z's boundary if z's boundary "dips into" y in such a way that it gets close to x. So the relation between x and z could be TPP(x,z) in some scenarios.

But upon further reflection, I think it's also possible that x doesn't touch z's boundary at all, in which case the relation would be NTPP(x,z).

So both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible.

Wait, I need to think more carefully:

1. NTPP(x,y): x is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, touching z's boundary.

Given these, we know x is inside y, and y is inside z. So x is definitely inside z.

The question is whether x touches z's boundary. Let's consider the constraints:
- x doesn't touch y's boundary.
- y touches z's boundary.

If y touches z's boundary, and x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), can x touch z's boundary?

For x to touch z's boundary, z's boundary would have to pass through y (since x is strictly inside y). But if z's boundary passed through y, then y would not be a proper part of z (because proper part means y is fully contained within z). This contradicts TPPi(y,z). So x cannot touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) the only possible relation.

Actually, no, I think I was wrong again. I need to be more precise.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. The boundary of z doesn't necessarily "cut through" y; y could just touch z's boundary from the inside.

Given that y touches z's boundary and x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), it seems like x would generally not touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

However, I think I was too quick to rule out TPP(x,z). Let's consider a specific example to check:

Imagine z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at one point, and x is a small circle inside y that doesn't touch y's boundary. In this case, x is indeed strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

But what if x is shaped in such a way that it extends towards the point where y touches z? It's possible for x to not touch y's boundary but still touch z's boundary if y and z have a common tangent at the point where they touch. So TPP(x,z) is also a possibility.

In fact, I need to reconsider all possible RCC-8 relations given the constraints:

1. NTPP(x,y): x is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, touching z's boundary.

Let's systematically evaluate all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This would mean x and z have no common points. But since x is inside y and y is inside z, x must be inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Similarly, since x is inside y and y is inside z, x must share interior points with z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is entirely inside z. So x is a proper part of z, and PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This might be possible if x, while not touching y's boundary, somehow touches z's boundary. This could happen if y touches z's boundary in a region where x gets very close to y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This is the most general case. If x is inside y and y is inside z, and x doesn't extend to touch z's boundary, then x is properly inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, z must be larger than x, so x cannot contain z. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. For the same reason as above, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (the same region). Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x must be smaller than z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, from this analysis, the possible relations between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But let me think again about TPP(x,z). I want to carefully check if there's really a scenario where x can touch z's boundary without touching y's boundary.

If TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary at some point or points.

Hmm, I think TPP(x,z) might not be possible after all. For x to touch z's boundary, x would have to extend to the point where y touches z. But if x extends to that point, it would also touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y).

But wait, it depends on the exact geometry. What if the region where y touches z is a flat segment, and x touches z within that segment without touching the rest of y's boundary? I'm not sure if this is geometrically possible in a way that satisfies all the constraints. I think I need to be more careful.

Actually, I think my earlier intuition might be correct. TPP(x,z) might not be possible given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's reason more precisely:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is fully contained within the interior of y.
- TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to touch z's boundary. But since x is fully contained within the interior of y, it would not reach z's boundary, which is outside the interior of y.

So, if x is fully contained within the interior of y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x must be fully contained within the interior of z as well. This means that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

I think that's the correct conclusion: given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me think one more time to be absolutely sure:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is fully contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary (which would be required for TPP(x,z)), x would need to extend to at least one point on z's boundary. But y only touches z's boundary tangentially, and since x is fully contained within the interior of y, x cannot reach those tangential points without touching y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, x must be fully contained within the interior of z, making NTPP(x,z) the only possible relation.

So, the answer to the question "If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is:

NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me think one more time about the possibility of TPP(x,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is fully contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to touch z's boundary while still being a proper part of z. Given that x is fully contained within the interior of y, and y touches z's boundary, I'm trying to envision a scenario where x could touch z's boundary without touching y's boundary.

Actually, let's think about it differently. Consider the following:
- The boundary of z may not be a simple curve; it can have dents or protrusions.
- If z's boundary protrudes into y in a way that it reaches x, then x could potentially touch z's boundary without touching y's boundary.

However, for this to happen, z's boundary would have to "cut into" y, which would make y not a proper part of z (since y would not be fully contained within z). This contradicts TPPi(y,z).

So, upon further reflection, I confirm that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, wait, let me think about this much more carefully. I think I've been assuming too much about the constraints imposed by the RCC-8 relations.

Let's review the definitions again:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y that does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's think step by step. Given that x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, it follows that x is a proper part of z. The question then becomes: does x touch z's boundary?

x does not touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)). And y touches z's boundary (from TPPi(y,z)).

For x to touch z's boundary, z's boundary would have to:
1. Either extend inside y to touch x, which would make y not a proper part of z (contradicting TPPi(y,z)).
2. Or x would have to extend to touch y's boundary at the very point where y touches z's boundary, which would contradict NTPP(x,y).

So, it seems like x cannot touch z's boundary given the constraints. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only valid relation.

Actually, in the RCC-8 calculus, regions are topologically regular closed sets. They have an interior and a boundary. A proper part means one region is fully contained within another.

Let's be very precise:
1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, and the closure of x does not intersect with the boundary of y.
2. TPPi(y,z) means y is a proper part of z, and the closure of y intersects with the boundary of z.

Given these, x is a proper part of z. The question is: does the closure of x intersect with the boundary of z?

From NTPP(x,y), the closure of x does not intersect with the boundary of y. From TPPi(y,z), the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z. Given these constraints, it doesn't seem possible for the closure of x to intersect with the boundary of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is the correct relation.

I think I've been overthinking this. Let's go with the conclusion that given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm concerned that there is something about the geometric constraints of these relations that I'm not properly understanding, I'm going to think about a concrete geometric example to verify.

Let's consider a scenario with circles, since it's easier to visualize:

1. z is a large circle.
2. y is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a single point.
3. x is an even smaller circle entirely within y, not touching y's boundary.

In this scenario:
- NTPP(x,y) holds because x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) holds because y is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

Now, for x and z:
- x is entirely within z (because it's within y, which is within z).
- x doesn't touch z's boundary (because it doesn't touch y's boundary, and the only part of y that touches z's boundary is on y's boundary).

So, NTPP(x,z) holds in this example.

I can also try to think of a different example, to see if there's a scenario where TPP(x,z) could hold:

1. z is a square.
2. y is a circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a single point.
3. x is a smaller region inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Could x touch z's boundary without touching y's boundary? If x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't touch z's boundary because the only part of y that touches z's boundary is on y's boundary.

I think I'm confident in my conclusion: given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, is there a problem with my mental model? Let me reconsider.

The RCC-8 relations are defined for regions in a topological space. Regions are considered to be non-empty regular closed sets. The relations are based on the intersection patterns between the interiors and boundaries of these regions.

Given this, let's reconsider the problem:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, and the closure of x does not intersect with the boundary of y.
TPPi(y,z) means y is a proper part of z, and the closure of y intersects with the boundary of z.

From NTPP(x,y), we know that x is fully contained within the interior of y. From TPPi(y,z), we know that y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary.

If x is fully contained within the interior of y, and y touches z's boundary, can x touch z's boundary? 

Think of it this way: the only part of y that can touch z's boundary is the boundary of y. Since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)), x can't reach the part of y that touches z's boundary. So, x can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is fully contained within the interior of z, making NTPP(x,z) the only possible relation.

I'm confident in my answer. Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, maybe I'm being too confident. Let's try to generate a counterexample:

Imagine:
1. z is a donut-shaped region.
2. y is a smaller region inside z, which touches the outer boundary of z.
3. x is a region inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Now, if z's hole is inside y (so y is not simply connected), and x surrounds this hole, could x touch z's boundary (the boundary of the hole) without touching y's boundary?

I think this might be a valid scenario where x touches z's boundary without touching y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) might be possible after all. Wait, actually I think that wouldn't work, since by definition if z has a hole, then that's actually in z's exterior, not a part of z itself.

Let me try once more to create a valid scenario where TPP(x,z) is possible:

RCC-8 is defined for regions in a topological space. These regions are considered to be non-empty regular closed sets. Given this, let's see if we can create a scenario where TPP(x,z) is valid:

1. Let z be a square.
2. Let y be a circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a single point.
3. Let x be a dumbbell-shaped region inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Hmm, but still, if x doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't touch z's boundary. Because y only touches z's boundary at y's boundary, and x doesn't touch y's boundary.

I am going to think it through one more time, more carefully:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is entirely contained within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Given these:
- x is entirely contained within the interior of y.
- y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary (which would be necessary for TPP(x,z)), it would need to reach a point on z's boundary. But the only part of y that touches z's boundary is on y's boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), it can't reach the part of y that touches z's boundary. Therefore, x can't touch z's boundary.

So, x is entirely contained within the interior of z, making NTPP(x,z) the only possible relation.

I've thought through this carefully and from different angles, and I'm confident that given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Given these relations:
1. x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
2. y is completely inside z (touching z's boundary)

Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, it follows that x must be inside z (a proper part of z).

The only question is whether x touches z's boundary or not. For x to touch z's boundary, it would need to reach to where y touches z's boundary. However, since x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), and the only places where y touches z's boundary are on y's boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
