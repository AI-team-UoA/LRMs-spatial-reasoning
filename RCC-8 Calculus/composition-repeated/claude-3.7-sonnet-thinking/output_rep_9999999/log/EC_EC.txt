PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work out systematically which relations are possible between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let's recall the eight relations in RCC-8:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x).
7. NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

We know that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). So x touches y at a boundary, and y touches z at a boundary.

Now let's go through each possible relation for x and z and check whether it's possible:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? Yes, if x and z are on opposite sides of y, they could be completely separated and share no points.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z touch at a boundary? Yes, if x and z both touch y, they could also touch each other at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap? Yes, x and z could both touch y at a boundary, but also overlap with each other.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z? This one is trickier. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But x also touches y's boundary. So z would have to extend beyond y. I think this is possible, but let me think more...

   Actually, I think this is not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z. But if x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of y, then z must also overlap with y, which contradicts the fact that EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

   Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me reconsider. If x is a tangential proper part of z, x touches the boundary of z. But x also touches the boundary of y (because EC(x,y)). So x is at the boundary of both y and z. Now, since EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary. So it's possible that x is exactly at the point where y and z touch. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

   Actually, let me think through this one more time. If TPP(x,z), then x is entirely contained in z, and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. But if x is entirely in z, and y doesn't overlap with z (because EC(y,z)), then y and x shouldn't be able to touch. So TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

   I've been going back and forth, but let me try to visualize this more carefully. If TPP(x,z), then x is entirely contained in z. But x also touches y's boundary. Since y and z only touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), the only way for x to touch y's boundary is if x touches z's boundary exactly at the point where z touches y. That is possible. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as another circle that touches z at a single point, and x as a small circle inside z that also touches the boundary of z at exactly the same point where z touches y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z? If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then it can't touch y's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (i.e., TPP(z,x)): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x? Using a similar reasoning as for TPP(x,z), z would have to be entirely inside x, and touch x's boundary. z also touches y's boundary. But if z is entirely inside x, and y doesn't overlap with x, then y and z shouldn't be able to touch. So TPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

   Actually, let me reconsider this too. If TPPi(x,z), then z is entirely contained in x, and touches x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. But if z is entirely in x, and y doesn't overlap with x (because EC(x,y)), then y and z shouldn't be able to touch. So TPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

   Wait, I'm making the same mistake again. Let me try to visualize it more carefully. If TPPi(x,z), then z is entirely contained in x. But z also touches y's boundary. Since x and y only touch at their boundaries (EC(x,y)), the only way for z to touch y's boundary is if z touches x's boundary exactly at the point where x touches y. That is possible. For example, imagine x as a large circle, y as another circle that touches x at a single point, and z as a small circle inside x that also touches the boundary of x at exactly the same point where x touches y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x? If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then it can't touch y's boundary, which contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are coincident? If x and z are the same, and EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). That doesn't seem impossible, but it would mean that x and y touch at a boundary, and y and x touch at a boundary, which is just the same relation described twice. So I think EQ(x,z) is possible.

   Actually, let me check this more carefully. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same. Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), we have EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). But the EC relation is symmetric, so EC(y,x) is the same as EC(x,y). So there's no contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me double-check EQ(x,z) one more time. If x and z are the same, then the statements "EC(x,y)" and "EC(y,z)" would be saying exactly the same thing, which is fine. So EQ(x,z) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

But I was going back and forth on some of these, so let me review the list one more time:

- DC(x,z): Yes, if x and z are on opposite sides of y, they could be completely separated.
- EC(x,z): Yes, if x and z both touch y, they could also touch each other at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): Yes, x and z could both touch y at a boundary, but also overlap with each other.
- TPP(x,z): Hmm, I was uncertain about this. Let me see...

   If TPP(x,z), then x is entirely contained in z, and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. But if x is entirely in z, and y doesn't overlap with z (because EC(y,z)), then y and x shouldn't be able to touch. So TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

   Wait, I think I've been making an error. If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, which means that x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. But if x is entirely in z, and y doesn't overlap with z (because EC(y,z)), then y and x shouldn't be able to touch unless x touches the boundary of z exactly where z touches y. That seems like a degenerate case, but it's still a possibility.

   So let's draw this out. We have EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). Imagine z as a circle, and y as another circle that touches z at a point. Now, if TPP(x,z), then x is a smaller circle entirely within z that touches z's boundary. For x to also satisfy EC(x,y), it would need to touch y's boundary, which means it would have to touch z's boundary exactly at the point where z touches y. That's a very specific configuration, but it is possible.

- TPPi(x,z): Similarly, if TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. Using the same reasoning, z would have to touch the boundary of x exactly at the point where x touches y, which is possible.

- NTPP(x,z): If NTPP(x,z), then x is entirely contained in z and does not touch z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. But if x is entirely in z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then x can't reach y's boundary (since y and z only touch at a boundary), which is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if NTPPi(x,z), then z is entirely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. But if z is entirely in x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z can't reach y's boundary (since y and x only touch at a boundary), which is a contradiction. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) would be the same statement, which is fine. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me re-examine the TPP and TPPi cases, because I'm not 100% confident in my analysis.

For TPP(x,z), if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. But if x is entirely in z, and y doesn't overlap with z (because EC(y,z)), then y and x shouldn't be able to touch unless x touches the boundary of z exactly where z touches y. That seems like a very specific configuration, but it is possible.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), if z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. But if z is entirely in x, and y doesn't overlap with x (because EC(x,y)), then y and z shouldn't be able to touch unless z touches the boundary of x exactly where x touches y. That's also a very specific configuration, but it is possible.

Actually, let me rethink TPP(x,z) one more time. If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, which means that x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. But if x is entirely in z, and y doesn't overlap with z (because EC(y,z)), then y and x shouldn't be able to touch unless x touches the boundary of z exactly where z touches y. That's a very specific configuration.

Let's visualize this: z is a circle, y is another circle that touches z at a point. Now, if TPP(x,z), then x is a smaller circle entirely within z that touches z's boundary. For x to also satisfy EC(x,y), it would need to touch y's boundary, which means it would have to touch z's boundary exactly at the point where z touches y.

Actually, I think there's an issue here. If x and y touch (EC(x,y)), and y and z touch (EC(y,z)), and x is entirely within z (TPP(x,z)), then x can only touch y if it touches z at the same point where z touches y. But that means x, y, and z all touch at a single point. Is that allowed in RCC-8?

Let me think about this more. In RCC-8, regions are supposed to be regular closed sets, so single points are not very well defined. But I think the intuition is that if regions touch, they share a boundary point but no interior points. So if x, y, and z all touch at a single point, that's still consistent with the EC relation.

So, I still think TPP(x,z) is possible, and similarly TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me also quickly check if there are any other cases I might have missed:

- DC(x,z): Definitely possible. x and z could be on opposite sides of y.
- EC(x,z): Definitely possible. x and z could both touch y, and also touch each other.
- PO(x,z): Definitely possible. x and z could both touch y, and also overlap with each other.
- TPP(x,z): Possibly, if x touches the boundary of z exactly where z touches y.
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible, as I explained earlier.
- TPPi(x,z): Possibly, if z touches the boundary of x exactly where x touches y.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, as I explained earlier.
- EQ(x,z): Definitely possible. If x and z are the same, EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) would be the same statement.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me double-check once more for each of these.

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. Since EC(y,z), y touches z's boundary. So for x to touch y's boundary, x must touch z's boundary exactly where z touches y. This is geometrically possible, so TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. So for z to touch y's boundary, z must touch x's boundary exactly where x touches y. This is geometrically possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Actually, let me do a final check for these two difficult cases:

For TPP(x,z): If x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary, and if y and z only touch at a boundary point, then for x to touch y's boundary, x would have to touch z's boundary exactly at the point where z touches y. This seems like a degenerate case, but it is geometrically possible.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary, and if y and x only touch at a boundary point, then for z to touch y's boundary, z would have to touch x's boundary exactly at the point where x touches y. This also seems like a degenerate case, but it is geometrically possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually I'm going to go through them all one more time to be really sure:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. Imagine y as a region, and x and z as regions on opposite sides of y, both touching y's boundary but not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z): This is definitely possible. Imagine x, y, and z as three regions that all touch each other at a common boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): This is definitely possible. Imagine y as a region, and x and z as regions that both overlap with y and with each other, but in such a way that x and y only touch at a boundary, and y and z only touch at a boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): As I've discussed, this is possible but requires a specific configuration. Imagine z as a large circle, y as another circle that touches z at a single point, and x as a small circle inside z that touches z's boundary exactly at the point where z touches y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then it can't touch y's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible but requires a specific configuration. Imagine x as a large circle, y as another circle that touches x at a single point, and z as a small circle inside x that touches x's boundary exactly at the point where x touches y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is not possible. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then it can't touch y's boundary, which contradicts EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): This is definitely possible. If x and z are the same, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) would be the same statement, which is fine.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Hmm wait, I need to actually check in more detail, because I think I might be incorrect about TPP and TPPi due to how the regions touch. Let me examine EC(x,y) more carefully.

In RCC-8, the EC relation is defined as:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

So, x and y share a boundary point (or a boundary region), but no interior points. Similarly, y and z share a boundary point (or a boundary region), but no interior points.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. Since EC(y,z), y touches z's boundary. If x is entirely in z, the only way x can touch y's boundary is if x touches z's boundary at the exact point (or region) where z touches y. That's a very specific configuration, but it's geometrically possible, so TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. If z is entirely in x, the only way z can touch y's boundary is if z touches x's boundary at the exact point (or region) where x touches y. That's also a specific configuration, but it's geometrically possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

OK, so I'm quite confident now that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me double-check once more, focusing on the degenerate cases TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z):

For TPP(x,z), if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, and if y and z only touch at a boundary, then for x to touch y, x would have to touch z's boundary exactly where z touches y. This is geometrically possible.

For TPPi(x,z), if z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and if y and x only touch at a boundary, then for z to touch y, z would have to touch x's boundary exactly where x touches y. This is also geometrically possible.

However, I want to be super sure that these configurations are allowed in RCC-8, given that they involve three regions touching at a single point or along a boundary segment. Let me think...

In RCC-8, if EC(a,b), then a and b share a boundary point or a boundary segment, but no interior points. There's nothing in the definition that restricts how many regions can touch at the same boundary point or segment. So, it's perfectly fine for x, y, and z to all touch at a common boundary point or segment.

Therefore, I am confident that the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z):

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z can be completely disconnected, on opposite sides of y.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z can touch at their boundaries, such as when all three regions meet at a common point.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap while both externally connected to y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary at exactly the point where z touches y.

5. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary at exactly the point where x touches y.

6. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be identical regions, both externally connected to y.

7. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x cannot touch y's boundary (which is required by EC(x,y)).

8. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, z cannot touch y's boundary (which is required by EC(y,z)).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
