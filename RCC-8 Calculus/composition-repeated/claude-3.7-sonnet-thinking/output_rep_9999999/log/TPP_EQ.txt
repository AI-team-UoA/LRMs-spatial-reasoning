PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given conditions and determine the relationship between x and z.

We are given:
1. TPP(x,y): This means x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. EQ(y,z): This means y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the same spatial region.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are the same region. So any relationship that x has with y, x will also have with z.

Since TPP(x,y), x is a tangential proper part of y. Since y and z are the same (EQ(y,z)), x is also a tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Let me double-check by considering the definitions:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident.

If y and z are coincident, then their boundaries are the same. If x touches y's boundary, it must also touch z's boundary. If x is part of y, it is also part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think more carefully. We know that TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z). Let's consider what EQ(y,z) means.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident. They have the same interior and the same boundary. So, if x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x is also a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

Let's verify once more:
- TPP(x,y): x is properly part of y (i.e., x is part of y but y is not part of x) and x touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region.

Given these, x is properly part of z and x touches z's boundary. So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, I should more carefully break this down with the properties of the RCC-8 relations.

TPP(x,y) implies:
1. x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is contained in y and x ≠ y).
2. x touches the boundary of y.

EQ(y,z) implies:
1. y and z have the same interior.
2. y and z have the same boundary.

Given these properties:
1. Since x is a proper part of y and y and z have the same interior, x is also a proper part of z.
2. Since x touches the boundary of y and y and z have the same boundary, x also touches the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more careful in my reasoning. I'll break down the RCC-8 relations more precisely.

In RCC-8, the eight basic relations are:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points).
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some interior points but neither is contained in the other).
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary).
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is properly contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (the inverse of TPP).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (the inverse of NTPP).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (they occupy the same space).

Now, given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), I want to determine the relationship between x and z.

TPP(x,y) means:
1. x is properly contained in y.
2. x touches y's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means:
1. y and z occupy the same space.
2. They have the same interior and boundary.

Since y and z are equal, any relationship that x has with y, x will also have with z. Since x is a tangential proper part of y, x is also a tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

In summary, given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, I should be more formal in my reasoning. Let's use the composition table for RCC-8 relations. The composition of two RCC-8 relations R1(x,y) and R2(y,z) gives the possible relations between x and z.

In this case, we want the composition of TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

From the composition table for RCC-8 relations, the composition of TPP and EQ is:

TPP ◦ EQ = TPP

This means that if TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check this with the definition of composition in relation algebra.

For relations R1 and R2, the composition R1 ◦ R2 is defined as:
(R1 ◦ R2)(x,z) if and only if there exists y such that R1(x,y) and R2(y,z).

In our case:
1. R1 is TPP.
2. R2 is EQ.
3. We know TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Now, let's reason about what TPP(x,z) means:
1. x is properly contained in z.
2. x touches z's boundary.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z have the same interior and boundary. Since TPP(x,y), x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary. Thus, x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Therefore, TPP(x,z) holds.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Just double checking, the composition of the RCC-8 relations TPP and EQ seems to be only TPP, which means if we have TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then we get TPP(x,z).

So the final answer is:
If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of the composition table. For the composition of TPP and EQ in RCC-8, we are asking: If x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is equal to z, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since y and z are equal (occupying the same space), any relationship that x has with y, x will also have with z. Since x is a tangential proper part of y (properly contained in y and touching y's boundary), x is also a tangential proper part of z (properly contained in z and touching z's boundary).

So, the composition of TPP and EQ should be:

TPP ◦ EQ = TPP

Which means if TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z).

The relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

OK, let me give the final answer:

If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the given relations combine to establish the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Analysis:
Since EQ(y,z), y and z have identical spatial properties - they have the same interior and the same boundary. 

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then:
- x is properly contained within y
- x touches y's boundary

Since z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), the same relationship must hold between x and z:
- x is properly contained within z
- x touches z's boundary

This precisely satisfies the definition of TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
