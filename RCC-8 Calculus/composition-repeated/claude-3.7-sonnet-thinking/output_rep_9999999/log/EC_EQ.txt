PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 spatial relationships between x and z given that EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they are essentially the same region from a spatial perspective. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that EC(x,y), and y and z are the same region, we can conclude that:
EC(x,z) must hold.

This is because:
- If x touches y at a boundary without sharing interior parts (EC(x,y))
- And z is exactly the same region as y (EQ(y,z))
- Then x must also touch z at a boundary without sharing interior parts (EC(x,z))

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC.

To double-check this reasoning:
EC(x,y) means x and y touch only at their boundaries.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.
Therefore, x and z must also touch only at their boundaries, which is EC(x,z).

The answer is EC(x,z).

Wait, let me think a bit more carefully. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy the same spatial region and have the same boundaries. Given that EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts, and given that z has the same boundary as y (because EQ(y,z)), it follows that x must also touch z at the boundary in the same way it touches y. Therefore, EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

So, the answer is: EC(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this from a formal composition perspective. In RCC-8, the composition of EC and EQ is computed as follows:

EC(x,y) âˆ˜ EQ(y,z) = EC(x,z)

This is because EQ is the identity relation in the composition table, meaning that if y and z are coincident, then the relationship between x and z must be the same as the relationship between x and y.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship(s) must hold between x and z given the two stated conditions.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they are exactly the same region)

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent and boundaries, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if x touches y at the boundary (EC), and z is exactly the same region as y, then x must also touch z at the boundary in the exact same way.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
