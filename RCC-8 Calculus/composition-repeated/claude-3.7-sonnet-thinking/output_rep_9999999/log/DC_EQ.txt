PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this systematically:

We're given that:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, which means they are exactly the same spatial region

Now I need to determine the possible relationship(s) between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same spatial region, any relationship that x has with y must also hold for x and z. In other words, the relationship between x and z must be the same as the relationship between x and y.

Given that DC(x,y), and y and z are the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x and z must also be disconnected.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- If x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and y is exactly the same as z (EQ(y,z)), then x must be disconnected from z as well.
- None of the other RCC-8 relations (EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) could hold between x and z because they all imply some form of connection or overlap, which contradicts the fact that x is disconnected from y, and y is the same as z.

So the answer is: DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z based on the given information.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (exactly the same spatial region)

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z occupy precisely the same space, any spatial relationship that x has with y must also hold between x and z. 

Because x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
