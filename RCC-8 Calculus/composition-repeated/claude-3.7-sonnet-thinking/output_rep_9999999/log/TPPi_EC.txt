PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about what the given relations tell us:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary.

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap in their interiors.

Now I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let's visualize this: 
- x is a region that contains y
- y touches the boundary of x
- y touches z at their boundaries
- y and z don't overlap in their interiors

So what are the possibilities for the relation between x and z?

Let's analyze each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This seems possible if z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, but z itself doesn't touch x.
   Wait, this doesn't make sense geometrically. If y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, then there must be a common point where all three regions meet. So x and z must at least touch.
   Actually, I need to be more careful. It's possible that y touches x's boundary at one location and touches z's boundary at a completely different location. In that case, x and z could be disconnected.
   So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This seems possible if z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, and z also touches x at that point.
   So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This seems possible if z overlaps with x, but neither is contained in the other. Given that y is inside x and touches z, z could partially extend inside x and partially outside.
   So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This would mean x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches z's boundary, and y also touches x's boundary, it seems geometrically possible for x to be tangentially contained in z.
   So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This would mean x is properly contained in z without touching z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible given the constraints. If y is inside x and touches z's boundary, and y also touches x's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary.
   So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x, touches x's boundary, and is externally connected to z, it seems possible for z to be tangentially contained in x.
   So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary. Given that y touches z and y touches x's boundary, if z were completely inside x without touching its boundary, then y would need to both touch x's boundary and reach into the interior to touch z. This seems contradictory to the statement that y is a tangential proper part of x.
   Let me reconsider. If z is completely inside x, and y touches both z and x's boundary, then y would need to extend from x's boundary to z. But this is exactly what we're given: y is a tangential proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.
   Actually, I'm getting confused here. Let me reason more carefully. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z, then y must extend from z to somewhere else inside x. But we're told that y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches x's boundary. This means that y extends from z to x's boundary. But if z is externally connected to y, then z and y only touch at their boundaries. This means that z can't be completely inside x without touching its boundary, because y would need to overlap with z, not just touch it.
   So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is externally connected to z, then y would have to be both inside and externally connected to the same region, which is contradictory.
   So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me verify these answers by thinking about concrete examples:

For DC(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle that touches x's boundary from the inside, and z as another circle that touches y's boundary from the outside without touching x. In this case, x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle that touches x's boundary from the inside, and z as another circle that touches both y's boundary and x's boundary at the same point. In this case, x and z are externally connected.

For PO(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle that touches x's boundary from the inside, and z as another circle that partially overlaps with x and touches y's boundary. In this case, x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle that touches x's boundary from the inside, and z as a larger circle that contains both x and y, with x touching z's boundary. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z.

For TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle that touches x's boundary from the inside, and z as an even smaller circle that is contained within x and touches both y's boundary and x's boundary. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x.

For NTPP(x,z):
I don't think this is possible, because if y touches x's boundary and y touches z's boundary, and y is contained in x, then z must also touch x's boundary if x is contained in z.

For NTPPi(x,z):
I don't think this is possible, because if y touches x's boundary and y touches z's boundary, and y is contained in x, then z must also touch x's boundary if z is contained in x.

For EQ(x,z):
This doesn't seem possible, because y can't be both inside x and externally connected to x at the same time.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider NTPPi(x,z) once more. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z, then y must extend from z to somewhere else inside x. But we're told that y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches x's boundary. This means that y extends from z to x's boundary. But if z is externally connected to y, then z and y only touch at their boundaries. This means that z can't be completely inside x without touching its boundary, because y would need to overlap with z, not just touch it.

Let me provide a more concrete example. Imagine:
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point
- z is a tiny circle that touches y's boundary at some point

If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (i.e., NTPPi(x,z)), then z touches y's boundary. But if z is externally connected to y, then z can't be inside y. So z must be outside y but still inside x. And if z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then it's possible for z to not touch x's boundary. This means NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me double-check this with a specific scenario:
- x is a large circle centered at the origin with radius 10
- y is a smaller circle centered at (5, 0) with radius 5, so it touches x's boundary at (10, 0)
- z is a tiny circle centered at (2, 0) with radius 1, so it touches y's boundary at (0, 0)

In this case, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But I made a mistake in my reasoning. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is inside x and touches x's boundary. But I initially said TPPi(x,y), which means x is a tangential proper part of y, which is the opposite of what I just described.

Let me revisit the original problem:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap in their interiors.

So:
- x is a region that contains y
- y touches the boundary of x
- y touches z at their boundaries
- y and z don't overlap in their interiors

Now, let's reanalyze NTPPi(x,z):
If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z, then y must extend from z to somewhere else inside x. But we're told that y is inside x and touches x's boundary. So y extends from z to x's boundary. If z is externally connected to y, then z and y only touch at their boundaries.

Let me provide a concrete example again:
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point
- z is a tiny circle that touches y's boundary at some point away from where y touches x's boundary

In this case, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check each of these with a concrete example:

For DC(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at one point
- z is another circle outside x, touching y's boundary at a point far from where y touches x's boundary

This doesn't work. If y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, and y is inside x, then z must also touch or overlap with x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me re-evaluate:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means x contains y, and y touches the boundary of x.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

For DC(x,z):
If x and z are disconnected, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z must at least touch x's boundary. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z):
If x and z are externally connected, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can touch x's boundary at the same point where y touches it. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
If x and z partially overlap, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can overlap with x and y can touch z at a point inside x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y would be inside z and touch z's boundary. This seems possible. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, then y would be inside z but not touching z's boundary. But we're told that y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can be inside x touching x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can be inside x without touching x's boundary, and y can touch both z's boundary and x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are equal, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y would be inside z touching z's boundary. But we're also told that y and z are externally connected, which means y can't be inside z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me revisit TPP(x,z) and make sure it's possible:

If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y would touch both x's boundary and z's boundary. If x touches z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y might or might not touch z's boundary, depending on where exactly y touches x's boundary.

Let me try a specific example:
- z is a large circle
- x is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point P
- y is an even smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at point P

In this case, y would also touch z's boundary at point P. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me revisit each one again with a clearer understanding:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

For DC(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z must at least touch x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can touch x's boundary without overlapping with x. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can overlap with x and y can touch z at a point inside x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x is a tangential proper part of z, then x touches z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary at a point where x touches z's boundary, then y also touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x doesn't touch z's boundary. But if y touches x's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y touches z's boundary and also touches x's boundary, and z touches x's boundary, then all three can touch at the same point. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If y touches z's boundary and also touches x's boundary, but z doesn't touch x's boundary, then y must extend from z to x's boundary. This is geometrically possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x and z are equal, then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. But we're also told that y and z are externally connected, which means y is outside z and touches z's boundary. These are contradictory. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I've now reconsidered all possibilities, and the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, something's still not right about my reasoning for TPP(x,z).

If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y is externally connected to z, then y would touch both x's boundary and z's boundary. If x touches z's boundary at point P, and y touches x's boundary at point Q, and if P and Q are different points, then y would not touch z's boundary. But if P and Q are the same point, then y would touch z's boundary.

Let me try a specific example:
- z is a large circle
- x is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point P
- y is an even smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at point P

In this case, y would also touch z's boundary at point P.

But what if:
- z is a large circle
- x is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point P
- y is an even smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a point Q different from P

In this case, y would not touch z's boundary, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So TPP(x,z) is only possible if y touches x's boundary at the same point where x touches z's boundary.

Let's revisit all possibilities one more time:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

For DC(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z must at least touch x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can touch x's boundary without overlapping with x. This is geometrically possible if y touches x's boundary at the same point where z touches x's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can overlap with x and y can touch z at a point inside x. This is geometrically possible. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x is a tangential proper part of z, then x touches z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary at a point where x touches z's boundary, then y also touches z's boundary. This is geometrically possible. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x doesn't touch z's boundary. But if y touches x's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary (because the point where y touches x's boundary would also be a point where x touches z's boundary). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y touches z's boundary and also touches x's boundary, and z touches x's boundary, then all three can touch at the same point. This is geometrically possible. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If y touches z's boundary and also touches x's boundary, but z doesn't touch x's boundary, then y must extend from z to x's boundary. This doesn't seem geometrically possible if y is only externally connected to z (touching at their boundaries). If y and z only touch at their boundaries, and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would have to reach from z to x's boundary, which means y would overlap with the space between z and x's boundary, not just touch z at the boundary.

Let me think again about NTPPi(x,z):
If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is externally connected to z, then y must touch z at a point and extend to x's boundary. This seems geometrically possible. y can touch z at one point and also touch x's boundary at another point, without overlapping with z. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x and z are equal, then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. But we're also told that y and z are externally connected, which means y is outside z and touches z's boundary. These are contradictory. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

The possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm not sure that's right. Let me revisit the meaning of the relations more carefully:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(y,x). This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

Let me check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then there must be a point where y, x, and z all meet. So x and z can't be disconnected. DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x and z can touch at the same point where y touches both of them. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can partially overlap with x, and y can touch z at a point inside x. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x is inside z touching z's boundary, then y touches x's boundary at a point where x touches z's boundary. In this case, y would also touch z's boundary. TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would touch x's boundary at a point that's inside z but not on z's boundary. In this case, y would not touch z's boundary, which contradicts EC(y,z). NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is inside x touching x's boundary, then y and z can both touch x's boundary at the same point. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y can touch z's boundary at one point and touch x's boundary at another point. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x and z are the same region, then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. But EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, which contradicts y being inside z. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I'm pretty satisfied with this set of possible relations, but let me do one last check:

For EC(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary, and z as another circle outside x that touches x's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary. In this case, y touches z's boundary at the same point. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary, and z as another circle that partially overlaps with x. If y touches x's boundary at a point where x and z overlap, and y also touches z's boundary, then PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at the same point where x touches z's boundary. In this case, y also touches z's boundary at the same point. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary, and y as another circle inside x that touches both x's boundary and z's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y as a kind of "bridge" that touches both z's boundary and x's boundary without overlapping with z. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For completeness, let me verify that the other relations are indeed impossible:

For DC(x,z):
If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary, then x and z must at least touch. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, then y is also completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But this contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are the same region, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, then y is inside z touching z's boundary. But this contradicts EC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

The final set of possible relations between x and z is: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to double-check myself on TPP(x,z) to make sure I'm not making an error.

Let's say TPP(x,z) holds, meaning x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

We're also given that TPPi(x,y) holds, meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Finally, we're given that EC(y,z) holds, meaning y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

If y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y is inside z. But if y is inside z, then y and z cannot be externally connected. This is a contradiction.

So TPP(x,z) is actually not possible.

Let me review all possibilities one more time:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then there must be a point where y, x, and z all meet. So x and z can't be disconnected. DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x and z can touch at the same point where y touches both of them. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can partially overlap with x, and y can touch z at a point inside x. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: If y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y is inside z. But if y is inside z, then y and z cannot be externally connected. This is a contradiction. TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: If y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y is inside z. But if y is inside z, then y and z cannot be externally connected. This is a contradiction. NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is inside x touching x's boundary, then y and z can both touch x's boundary at the same point. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y can touch z's boundary at one point and touch x's boundary at another point. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x and z are the same region, then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. But EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, which contradicts y being inside z. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I'm quite confident in this answer. Let's make one last visual check:

For EC(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point P
- z is another circle outside x that touches x's boundary at point P

In this case, y and z both touch x's boundary at point P, so y and z touch at point P as well. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point P
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with x, with the overlap including point P

In this case, y touches x's boundary at point P, which is also part of z, so y and z touch at point P. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point P
- z is an even smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point P

In this case, y and z both touch x's boundary at point P, so y and z touch at point P as well. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point P
- z is an even smaller circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- y touches z's boundary at a point Q

In this case, y touches x's boundary at point P and touches z's boundary at point Q. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, actually let me revisit PO(x,z). In my example for PO(x,z), I had:

- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point P
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with x, with the overlap including point P

But this doesn't make sense, because if y touches x's boundary at point P, and point P is inside z, then y and z would overlap, not just touch at their boundaries. But EC(y,z) means y and z only touch at their boundaries. So my example doesn't work.

Let me reconsider PO(x,z). If x and z partially overlap, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, and y is externally connected to z, then y must touch x's boundary at a point where x and z meet. In other words, y touches x's boundary at a point that's also on z's boundary.

Let me try a different example:
- x is a large circle
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with x
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at a point where x and z meet

In this case, y touches x's boundary at a point that's also on z's boundary, so y and z touch at that point without overlapping. So PO(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, one more issue with TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then z and y can both touch x's boundary, but at different points. In that case, z and y would not touch, contradicting EC(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z) to be possible, z and y must touch x's boundary at the same point. Let me verify this is geometrically possible:

- x is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point P
- y is another circle inside x that also touches x's boundary at point P

In this case, y and z both touch x's boundary at point P, so y and z touch at point P as well. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I've gone around in circles a bit, but I'm pretty confident in this final set of relations.

Actually, let me reconsider TPP(x,z). I previously concluded that if y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y is inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). But I was too strict in my interpretation. If y touches x's boundary, and x touches z's boundary, and they all touch at the same point, then y is inside x, x is inside z, and y touches z's boundary at a single point. This allows for both TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) to be true.

Let me verify with a concrete example:
- z is a large circle
- x is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at point P
- y is an even smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point P

In this case, y touches x's boundary at point P, which is also where x touches z's boundary, so y and z touch at point P as well. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

One thing I've been forgetting is that RCC-8 relations are binary, so the fact that y is inside x and touches x's boundary is not directly expressible by TPPi(x,y). Rather, TPPi(x,y) means that x is inside y and touches y's boundary, which is the opposite of what I've been thinking.

Let me clarify:
- TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

So:
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary
- y and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping

Now, let's reanalyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x could be disconnected from z if x touches y's boundary at a point far from where y touches z's boundary. DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x can touch z's boundary without overlapping if x touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x and z might partially overlap if x touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary, and x extends beyond that point into z. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary if x touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary, and x is contained within z. TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary if x touches y's boundary at a point far from where y touches z's boundary, and x is contained within z. NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z could be inside x and touch x's boundary if z is inside y and touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary, and z is contained within x. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary if z is inside y and touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary, and z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x and z could be equal if they both touch y's boundary at the same point, and they are the same region. EQ(x,z) is possible.

Wait, but I feel like my interpretation doesn't make sense. If x is inside y, how can z be inside x? Let me reconsider.

The problem says TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z). 

TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

Wait, no, that's not right. TPPi(x,y) means that TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Let me restart with the correct interpretation:

- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

So:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping

Now, let's reanalyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x and z can't be completely disconnected because there must be a point where y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary. DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x and z can touch at the same point where y touches both of them. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then z can partially overlap with x, and y can touch z at a point inside x. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: If y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y is inside z. But if y is inside z, then y and z cannot be externally connected. This is a contradiction. TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: If y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y is inside z. But if y is inside z, then y and z cannot be externally connected. This is a contradiction. NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is inside x touching x's boundary, then y and z can both touch x's boundary at the same point. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y can touch z's boundary at one point and touch x's boundary at another point. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and x and z are the same region, then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. But EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, which contradicts y being inside z. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm forgetting that if y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then for z to be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)), z and y would have to touch at a point where z touches x's boundary. This is geometrically possible if y touches x's boundary at the same point where z touches x's boundary.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

One final check: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, and we want to know what relations are possible between x and z, then the possibilities are:

1. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: This is possible if y touches x's boundary at a point where x and z touch.

2. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: This is possible if y touches x's boundary at a point inside the overlap of x and z.

3. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary at the same point.

4. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is possible if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary at one point and touches x's boundary at another point.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I believe these are the only four possibilities.

Actually, I'm thinking too hard. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is externally connected to z, then the possible relations between x and z are those that are geometrically consistent with these constraints.

For EC(x,z), we can have y touch x's boundary at a point where x and z touch.

For PO(x,z), we can have y touch x's boundary at a point inside the overlap of x and z, or at a point where x and z meet.

For TPP(x,z), we would have x inside z and touching z's boundary. But then y would be inside z (since y is inside x and x is inside z), which contradicts EC(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z), we would have x inside z and not touching z's boundary. But then y would be inside z (since y is inside x and x is inside z), which contradicts EC(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z), we can have z inside x and touching x's boundary, with y touching both x's boundary and z's boundary at the same point.

For NTPPi(x,z), we can have z inside x and not touching x's boundary, with y touching z's boundary at one point and touching x's boundary at another point.

For EQ(x,z), we would have x and z being the same region. But then y would be inside z (since y is inside x and x = z), which contradicts EC(y,z).

For DC(x,z), we would have x and z being completely disconnected. But if y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary, then x and z must meet at some point (where y touches both).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

This is my final answer, and I'm confident in it.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which spatial relations between x and z are consistent with the given information: TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these given relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap)

Now I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   Not possible. If y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, then x and z must at least touch at some point.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries at the same point where y touches x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   Possible. x and z can overlap, with y touching z's boundary at a point where x and z meet.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   Not possible. If x were inside z, then y would also be inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   Not possible. For the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   Possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while y touches both z's boundary and x's boundary at different points.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
