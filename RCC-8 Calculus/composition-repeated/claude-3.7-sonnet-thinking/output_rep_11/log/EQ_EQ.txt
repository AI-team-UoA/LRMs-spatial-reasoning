PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem systematically.

Given:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident

Question: What are the possible relationships between x and z?

First, let's recall what EQ(x,y) means formally. It means that x and y occupy exactly the same spatial region - they have identical boundaries and interiors.

Now, if:
- x and y occupy exactly the same region (EQ(x,y))
- y and z occupy exactly the same region (EQ(y,z))

Then logically, x and z must also occupy exactly the same region. This is essentially a transitive property of equality.

So the relationship between x and z must be:
EQ(x,z)

This follows from the transitive property of the equality relation. If x equals y and y equals z, then x must equal z.

Let's double-check this by thinking about the alternatives:

Could x and z be DC (disconnected)? No, because both are equal to y, so they must overlap completely.
Could x and z be EC (externally connected)? No, same reason.
Could x and z be PO (partially overlapping)? No, they must overlap completely.
Could x and z be TPP (tangential proper part)? No, because neither can be a proper part of the other if they're both equal to y.
Could x and z be NTPP (non-tangential proper part)? No, same reason as TPP.
Could x and z be TPPi (inverse tangential proper part)? No, same reason.
Could x and z be NTPPi (inverse non-tangential proper part)? No, same reason.

The only possible relation is EQ(x,z).

So my answer is: EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship must hold between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region with identical boundaries and interiors.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident in the same way.

By the transitive property of equality:
- If x equals y (they occupy the same region)
- And y equals z (they occupy the same region)
- Then x must equal z (they must occupy the same region)

No other RCC-8 relation is possible between x and z given these constraints.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
