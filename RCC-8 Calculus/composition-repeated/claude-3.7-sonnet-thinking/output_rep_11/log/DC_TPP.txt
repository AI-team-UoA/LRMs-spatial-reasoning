PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step. We have:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now we need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let's think about each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - If x is disconnected from y, and y is part of z, then x could be disconnected from z as well. This is possible if x is entirely outside of z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
   - If x is disconnected from y, and y is part of z, then x could touch the boundary of z. This is possible if x touches z at a point where y is not present.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - If x is disconnected from y, and y is part of z, then x could partially overlap with z. This happens if x overlaps with parts of z that don't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - If x is disconnected from y, and y is part of z, can x be a tangential proper part of z? If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, it would be a TPP of z. But we know x is disconnected from y, which is already part of z. So it seems like this is possible as long as x and y don't overlap or touch.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - Similarly, if x is disconnected from y and y is part of z, x could be contained entirely within z without touching its boundary. This is possible as long as x and y don't overlap or touch.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - If z is part of x, then y is also part of x (since y is part of z). But we know x and y are disconnected, which means they don't share any parts. So this relation is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - Similarly, this would imply y is part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). Not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   - If x and z are the same, then y would be part of x. But we know x and y are disconnected, so this is not possible.

Wait, I need to reconsider points 4 and 5. If x is a TPP or NTPP of z, then x is part of z. If y is also part of z, does that mean x and y must share some parts or be connected? Not necessarily. They can be separate parts of z.

For instance, imagine z as a big circle, and y as a small circle inside z, touching z's boundary. Now, x could be another small circle inside z, completely separate from y. In this case, x and y are disconnected (DC), and both are parts of z, with x being either TPP or NTPP depending on whether it touches z's boundary.

So, to summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is completely outside of z.
- EC(x,z): x touches the boundary of z.
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me double-check these:

For DC(x,z):
If x is disconnected from y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's possible for x to be completely outside of z. This is consistent.

For EC(x,z):
If x is disconnected from y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's possible for x to touch the boundary of z without overlapping with y. This is consistent.

For PO(x,z):
If x is disconnected from y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's possible for x to partially overlap with z. This is consistent.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is disconnected from y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z as well, as long as x and y don't overlap. This is consistent.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is disconnected from y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, as long as x and y don't overlap. This is consistent.

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, then y, being a part of z, would also be a part of x. But we know x and y are disconnected, so this is inconsistent.

For NTPPi(x,z):
Similarly, if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y would be a part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). This is inconsistent.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are the same, then y, being a part of z, would also be a part of x. But we know x and y are disconnected, so this is inconsistent.

Actually, I realize I might be making a mistake in my reasoning about TPP and NTPP. Let me reconsider:

If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
If DC(x,y), then x and y are disconnected. This means they don't share any parts and they don't touch.

Now, can x be a TPP or NTPP of z while being disconnected from y?

If x is a TPP or NTPP of z, then x is inside z. If y is also inside z, can x and y be disconnected? Yes, they can, as long as they don't overlap or touch. They can be separate regions within z.

For instance, imagine z as a big square, y as a small square in the top-right corner of z, touching z's boundary. Now, x could be another small square in the bottom-left corner of z, not touching or overlapping with y. In this case, DC(x,y) and both could be TPP of z.

Similarly, x could be a small square entirely within z, not touching z's boundary (making it NTPP of z), and still be disconnected from y.

So, my previous conclusion was correct: the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually I should draw this out. Let me use O to represent a region and [] to represent a boundary.

For DC(x,z):
z: [      y      ]
x: O   (outside of z)

For EC(x,z):
z: [      y      ]
   |
x: O (touching z's boundary)

For PO(x,z):
z: [      y      ]
   |
x: [O] (partially inside, partially outside of z)

For TPP(x,z):
z: [      y      x      ]
              (x touches z's boundary)

For NTPP(x,z):
z: [      y       [x]      ]
              (x doesn't touch z's boundary)

So my reasoning was correct.

However, let's be even more careful. I'll think about the constraints and what they mean more directly.

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected. They share no parts and they don't touch.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let me go through each RCC-8 relation and check if it's consistent with these constraints:

1. DC(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from z, then it's entirely outside of z. If y is inside z, then x would also be disconnected from y. This is consistent with the given constraints.

2. EC(x,z):
   If x touches the boundary of z but doesn't overlap with it, can x be disconnected from y? y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x touches a different part of z's boundary than y does, then x and y can be disconnected. This is consistent.

3. PO(x,z):
   If x partially overlaps with z, then part of x is inside z and part is outside. The part of x that's inside z can be disconnected from y, as long as they don't overlap or touch. This is consistent.

4. TPP(x,z):
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. x can be disconnected from y as long as they don't overlap or touch within z. This is consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, x can be disconnected from y as long as they don't overlap or touch within z. This is consistent.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This means y, being part of z, is also inside x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected. This is inconsistent.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This means y, being part of z, is also inside x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected. This is inconsistent.

8. EQ(x,z):
   If x and z are coincident, then they are the same region. This means y, being part of z, is also part of x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected. This is inconsistent.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me visualize each of these situations to be extra sure:

DC(x,z):
```
     z
    /|
   / |
  /  |
 /   |
/____| y
 
x o
```
In this picture, z is a rectangle containing y, and x is outside z. Clearly x and y are disconnected, so this is consistent.

EC(x,z):
```
     z
    /|
   / |
  /  |
 /   |
/____| y
 |
 | x
 o
```
Here, x touches the boundary of z but doesn't overlap with it. x and y are still disconnected, so this is consistent.

PO(x,z):
```
     z
    /|
   / |
  /  |
 /   |
/____| y
 |
 | x
 o____
|     |
|_____|
```
Here, x partially overlaps with z. The part of x that's inside z doesn't overlap with y, so x and y are disconnected. This is consistent.

TPP(x,z):
```
     z
    /|_______
   / |       |
  /  |       |
 /   |      x|
/____| y     |
          |__|
```
Here, x is inside z and touches z's boundary. x and y are disconnected, so this is consistent.

NTPP(x,z):
```
     z
    /|_________
   / |         |
  /  |     x   |
 /   |    ___  |
/____| y  |___|  |
              |
              |
```
Here, x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. x and y are disconnected, so this is consistent.

So, my conclusion remains: the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, now that I'm thinking about it more, I realize that there's something I missed in my reasoning. Let's be more rigorous:

1. DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected. They share no common points.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper subset of z, and y shares at least one point with the boundary of z.

Now, let's think about the constraints these place on the relation between x and z:

If x and y are disconnected, and y is a tangential proper part of z, what does this tell us about x and z?

Let's go through each RCC-8 relation and check if it's consistent with these constraints:

1. DC(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from z, then x and z share no common points. Since y is a subset of z, this means x and y also share no common points, which is consistent with DC(x,y). So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z):
   If x and z are externally connected, then x and z share at least one boundary point but no interior points. Since y is a subset of z, if y and x share a point, it would be a point of z. But we know that x and y are disconnected, so they can't share any points. For EC(x,z) to be consistent with DC(x,y), the points where x and z are connected must not be part of y. This is possible, so EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z):
   If x and z partially overlap, then x and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), the region where x and z overlap must not include any part of y. This is possible, so PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z):
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is a proper subset of z and shares at least one point with the boundary of z. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), x and y must not share any points, which means they must be disjoint subsets of z. This is possible, so TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is a proper subset of z and shares no points with the boundary of z. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), x and y must not share any points, which means they must be disjoint subsets of z. This is possible, so NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is a proper subset of x and shares at least one point with the boundary of x. Since y is a subset of z, this means y is also a subset of x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected, because subsets share points. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is a proper subset of x and shares no points with the boundary of x. Since y is a subset of z, this means y is also a subset of x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected, because subsets share points. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z):
   If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. Since y is a subset of z, this means y is also a subset of x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected, because subsets share points. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

This is consistent with my previous conclusion.

Let me just double-check and think about a few examples for each case.

DC(x,z): 
Imagine z as a circle, y as a small circle inside z touching its boundary, and x as a point outside z. Clearly, x and y are disconnected, and y is a tangential proper part of z. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

EC(x,z): 
Imagine z as a circle, y as a small circle inside z touching its boundary at point A, and x as a point outside z but touching z's boundary at point B, where B is not A. Then, x and y are disconnected, y is a tangential proper part of z, and x and z are externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

PO(x,z): 
Imagine z as a circle, y as a small circle inside z touching its boundary, and x as a circle that overlaps with z but not with y. Then, x and y are disconnected, y is a tangential proper part of z, and x and z partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

TPP(x,z): 
Imagine z as a large square, y as a small square in the top-right corner of z, touching z's boundary, and x as a small square in the bottom-left corner of z, also touching z's boundary. Then, x and y are disconnected, y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is also a tangential proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): 
Imagine z as a large square, y as a small square in the top-right corner of z, touching z's boundary, and x as a small square in the middle of z, not touching z's boundary. Then, x and y are disconnected, y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, my conclusion remains: the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I noticed there was an error in a couple of my previous checks. Let me reconsider the TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ relations:

TPPi(x,z): 
If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is a proper subset of x and shares at least one point with the boundary of x. This means that z is contained within x. Since y is a tangential proper part of z, y is contained within z. Therefore, y is contained within x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected, because if y is contained within x, they share points. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z): 
If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is a proper subset of x and shares no points with the boundary of x. This means that z is contained within the interior of x. Since y is a tangential proper part of z, y is contained within z. Therefore, y is contained within the interior of x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected, because if y is contained within x, they share points. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

EQ(x,z): 
If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. Since y is a tangential proper part of z, y is a tangential proper part of x. But this contradicts the constraint that x and y are disconnected, because if y is a part of x, they share points. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP. I got this correct in my earlier reasoning.

To validate these, let me see if I can think of a contradiction for any of them.

For DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z), I've already shown that they're consistent with the constraints DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z), I've shown that they're inconsistent with the constraints DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

So, I believe my answer is correct: the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me provide a table to summarize:

| Relation | Possible? | Reason |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| DC(x,z)  | Yes       | If x is disconnected from z, and y is part of z, then x is disconnected from y. |
| EC(x,z)  | Yes       | If x touches z at a point where y isn't, then x and y are disconnected. |
| PO(x,z)  | Yes       | If x overlaps with parts of z that don't include y, then x and y are disconnected. |
| TPP(x,z) | Yes       | If x is a tangential proper part of z but doesn't overlap with y, then x and y are disconnected. |
| NTPP(x,z)| Yes       | If x is a non-tangential proper part of z but doesn't overlap with y, then x and y are disconnected. |
| TPPi(x,z)| No        | If z is a tangential proper part of x, then y, being part of z, is part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). |
| NTPPi(x,z)| No       | If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y, being part of z, is part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). |
| EQ(x,z)  | No        | If x and z are the same, then y, being part of z, is part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). |

So, my answer is: the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just make sure that I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's a more systematic way to approach this. 

We know:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They share no points.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper subset of z, and y shares at least one point with the boundary of z.

From these, we can infer constraints on the relation between x and z. 

Let's denote by Int(r) the interior of region r, and by Bd(r) the boundary of region r.

TPP(y,z) means:
- Int(y) ⊆ Int(z) (the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z)
- Bd(y) ∩ Bd(z) ≠ ∅ (the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z)
- y ⊂ z (y is a proper subset of z)

DC(x,y) means:
- x ∩ y = ∅ (x and y are disjoint)

Now, for each RCC-8 relation, let's see if it's consistent with these constraints:

1. DC(x,z):
   DC(x,z) means x ∩ z = ∅. Since y ⊂ z, this implies x ∩ y = ∅, which is consistent with DC(x,y). So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z):
   EC(x,z) means Int(x) ∩ Int(z) = ∅ and x ∩ z ≠ ∅. Since Int(y) ⊆ Int(z), this implies Int(x) ∩ Int(y) = ∅. For EC(x,z) to be consistent with DC(x,y), we need x ∩ y = ∅. This means the intersection of x and z must be entirely on the boundary of z, and that intersection can't include any part of y. This is possible, so EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z):
   PO(x,z) means Int(x) ∩ Int(z) ≠ ∅, x ⊄ z, and z ⊄ x. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), the overlap between x and z must not include any part of y. This is possible, so PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z):
   TPP(x,z) means Int(x) ⊆ Int(z), Bd(x) ∩ Bd(z) ≠ ∅, and x ⊂ z. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), x and y must be disjoint subsets of z. This is possible, so TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   NTPP(x,z) means Int(x) ⊂ Int(z) and Bd(x) ∩ Bd(z) = ∅. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), x and y must be disjoint subsets of Int(z). This is possible, so NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   TPPi(x,z) means Int(z) ⊆ Int(x), Bd(x) ∩ Bd(z) ≠ ∅, and z ⊂ x. Since y ⊂ z, this implies y ⊂ x. But this contradicts DC(x,y), which requires x ∩ y = ∅. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   NTPPi(x,z) means Int(z) ⊂ Int(x) and Bd(x) ∩ Bd(z) = ∅. Since y ⊂ z, this implies y ⊂ x. But this contradicts DC(x,y), which requires x ∩ y = ∅. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z):
   EQ(x,z) means x = z. Since y ⊂ z, this implies y ⊂ x. But this contradicts DC(x,y), which requires x ∩ y = ∅. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

I'm satisfied that this analysis is correct and thorough.

So, the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations can hold between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no shared points)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x is completely outside z, then x would also be disconnected from y (which is inside z).

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x touches z's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch it, then x and y remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x partially overlaps with z in an area that doesn't include y, then x and y remain disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. If x is inside z touching z's boundary, but in a separate area from y, then x and y remain disconnected.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. If x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, and doesn't overlap with y, then x and y remain disconnected.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a part of x, then y (being part of z) would also be part of x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is completely inside x, then y would also be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be part of x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
