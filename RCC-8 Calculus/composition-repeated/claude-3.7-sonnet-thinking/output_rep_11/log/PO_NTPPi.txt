PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'll work this through step by step.

We're told:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - This means NTPP(z,y), so z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let's think about what PO(x,y) means: x and y share some region, but x extends beyond y in some parts, and y extends beyond x in other parts.

Let's think about what NTPPi(y,z) means: z is completely contained within y, not touching y's boundary. In other words, z is a proper subset of y with some buffer space between z's boundary and y's boundary.

Given these constraints, what could be the relationship between x and z?

Case 1: x and z might not overlap at all. This could happen if z is in a portion of y that doesn't overlap with x. In this case, we would have DC(x,z).

Case 2: x and z might touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points. This could happen if z extends all the way to the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y. In this case, we would have EC(x,z).

Case 3: x and z might partially overlap. This would happen if z intersects with the region where x and y overlap. In this case, we would have PO(x,z).

Case 4: z might be a tangential proper part of x. This could happen if z is completely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, and z touches the boundary of this overlapping region at points where it also coincides with the boundary of x. In this case, we would have TPP(z,x), or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

Case 5: z might be a non-tangential proper part of x. This could happen if z is completely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of this overlapping region at any point that coincides with the boundary of x. In this case, we would have NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

I'm not sure if x could be a proper part of z, either tangential or non-tangential. Let's check:

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary. But since z is completely contained within y (due to NTPP(z,y)), and x extends beyond y in some regions (due to PO(x,y)), it's not possible for x to be completely contained within z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely contained within z and not touch z's boundary. But again, since z is completely contained within y, and x extends beyond y in some regions, it's not possible for x to be completely contained within z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Finally, for EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to be coincident. But since z is completely contained within y, and x extends beyond y in some regions, it's not possible for x and z to be coincident. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to be a bit more careful here, because I'm not accounting for the "non-tangential" aspect of NTPPi(y,z) correctly.

Let me reconsider the constraints:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Hmm, actually, I think my analysis above is wrong because I was thinking about TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) but then incorrectly writing them as TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me redo the analysis.

Given:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - z contains y as a non-tangential proper part.

Actually, wait, I think I misunderstood NTPPi(y,z). It should mean that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. Let me start over.

Given:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) - This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y). That is, z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If z is contained entirely within a part of y that doesn't overlap with x, then x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): If z extends to the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y, and this boundary includes parts of x's boundary, then x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): If z overlaps with the region where x and y overlap, but z also has parts that are in y but not in x, and vice versa, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(z,x): If z is completely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, and z touches the boundary of x at some point, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

5. NTPP(z,x): If z is completely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x at any point, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

For the remaining relations:

6. TPP(x,z): For this to hold, x would need to be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary. But since z is completely contained within y (due to NTPP(z,y)), and x extends beyond y in some regions (due to PO(x,y)), it's not possible for x to be completely contained within z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): For this to hold, x would need to be completely contained within z and not touch z's boundary. But again, since z is completely contained within y, and x extends beyond y in some regions, it's not possible for x to be completely contained within z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For this to hold, x and z would need to be coincident. But since z is completely contained within y, and x extends beyond y in some regions, it's not possible for x and z to be coincident. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,x))
- NTPPi(x,z) (which is the same as NTPP(z,x))

Actually, let me double-check this. I know that TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x) which means that z is a tangential proper part of x. Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x) which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

OK so we have five possible relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x). Or equivalently: DC, EC, PO, TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z). Let me double-check this answer.

Given:
1. PO(x,y): x and y share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z): z is fully contained within y, away from y's boundary.

We want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

I know that PO(x,y) means x and y overlap, but neither is a subset of the other. So x extends beyond y in some places, y extends beyond x in others, and they share a common region.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is fully contained within y, and z doesn't touch y's boundary. So z is surrounded by y on all sides.

Now, let's consider all eight possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
This is possible if z is entirely contained in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior.
This is possible if z extends to the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y, and this boundary includes parts where x and y meet.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
This is possible if z extends into the region where x and y overlap, but z also has parts in y that are not in x, and x has parts that are not in z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
For this to happen, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But since z is completely inside y, and x extends beyond y in some places (from PO(x,y)), x cannot be completely inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
For similar reasons to TPP(x,z), this is not possible because x cannot be completely inside z when x extends beyond y in some places.

6. TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)): z is a tangential proper part of x.
This is possible if z is entirely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, and z touches the boundary of this region at points where it also coincides with the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
This is possible if z is entirely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of this region at any point that coincides with the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
This is not possible because z is completely inside y, and x extends beyond y in some places (from PO(x,y)), so x and z cannot be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me verify this once more.

Hmm, I realized there's a technical issue with my reasoning for EC(x,z). If z is strictly inside y (which NTPP(z,y) implies), then z cannot touch the boundary of y. If z can't touch the boundary of y, and x and y only meet at their boundaries, then z can't touch x. So EC(x,z) may not be possible.

But actually, this isn't right either. PO(x,y) means x and y share some interior points. So it's still possible for z to be within y, not touching y's boundary, and still touch the boundary of x inside the region where x and y overlap.

Hmm, let's think about this more carefully.

Ah, I see the issue. I need to be more precise about the boundary and interior of regions.

Let's revisit:
1. PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z): z is fully contained within y, away from y's boundary. This means that z's boundary is completely surrounded by y's interior.

Now, let's reconsider EC(x,z):
For EC(x,z) to be possible, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. If z is entirely within the interior of y, and x and y share some interior points, then it's possible for x and z to share a boundary point without sharing any interior points. This can happen if z's boundary touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y at a point that also happens to be on the boundary of x.

Actually, I think there might be a cleaner way to approach this. Let's use the composition table for RCC-8 relations. The composition of PO and NTPPi gives the set of possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me instead use some intuition from set theory and region connection calculus.

We know that y proper-contains z (that's what NTPPi(y,z) means). And we know that x partially overlaps with y (that's what PO(x,y) means).

Now, where can z be in relation to x?

1. z could be entirely outside the region where x and y overlap. In this case, z would be disconnected from x, so DC(x,z).

2. z could intersect with the boundary of the region where x and y overlap, but not share any interior points with x. In this case, z would be externally connected to x, so EC(x,z).

3. z could partially overlap with the region where x and y overlap, meaning z and x share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. In this case, PO(x,z).

4. z could be entirely within the region where x and y overlap, and touch the boundary of this region at points where it coincides with the boundary of x. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

5. z could be entirely within the region where x and y overlap, and not touch the boundary of this region at any point that coincides with the boundary of x. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I need to be more careful about the boundaries. If z doesn't touch y's boundary (as NTPPi(y,z) implies), and x and y only share a boundary, then z and x can't touch. But PO(x,y) means x and y share interior points, so there's still the possibility for z to touch the boundary of x within the region where x and y overlap.

I need to be more precise. Let's use the definitions more carefully.

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y share some interior points.
- There are points in x that are not in y.
- There are points in y that are not in x.

NTPPi(y,z) means:
- y is completely contained within the interior of z.
- None of y touches the boundary of z.

With these definitions, let's reconsider:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
This is possible if y (which contains x partially) and z (which contains y completely) are arranged such that the part of y that overlaps with x doesn't overlap with z.

Hmm, wait. NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely contained within z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary. 

But this contradicts what I wrote earlier where I interpreted NTPPi(y,z) as "z is fully contained within y, away from y's boundary." Let me clarify this.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(z,y). 
NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.
So, NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me redo my analysis with this correct interpretation.

Given:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
2. NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

This means:
- x and y share some region, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- y is completely contained within z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This would mean x and z don't share any points. But since y is completely contained within z, and x and y share some points, x and z must share some points. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But since y (which overlaps with x) is completely contained within the interior of z, and not touching z's boundary, x and z must share some interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This would mean x and z share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other. Since y is completely inside z, and x and y share some points, x and z share some interior points. Also, since y is not fully contained in x (from PO(x,y)), and y is completely contained in z, z is not fully contained in x. For x to not be fully contained in z, there must be parts of x that extend beyond y and do not overlap with z.
Let's check if this is possible... If y is a proper part of z, then z could extend beyond y in areas where x does not. Thus, it's possible for x to have parts outside of z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. If y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, can x be completely inside z but touch z's boundary?

If x is also partially outside y, then x could touch z's boundary (assuming z and y share a boundary where x crosses). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Oh wait, I made an error. If y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y doesn't touch z's boundary. So if x partially overlaps with y and extends beyond y, it's possible for x to be completely contained within z, and for the part of x that extends beyond y to touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, can x be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary?

Yes, if the part of x that extends beyond y still remains within the interior of z, then x can be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. But since y is completely contained within z, and x and y only partially overlap, there must be parts of z (specifically, the parts that contain portions of y that don't overlap with x) that are not contained within x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For the same reason as above, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. Since y is a proper part of z, and x and y only partially overlap, x and z can't be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, from the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

OK, from first principles, let's review this carefully.

If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior, but neither is contained in the other.
If NTPPi(y,z), then y is completely contained within the interior of z, and no part of y touches the boundary of z.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, I'll consider each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z share no points. But since y is completely contained within z, and x shares points with y (from PO(x,y)), x must share points with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since y is completely within the interior of z, and x shares interior points with y, x must share interior points with z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other. 

Let's check if this is possible:
- x and z share interior points (because x shares interior points with y, and y is contained within the interior of z).
- z is not completely contained in x (because y is contained within z, and y is not completely contained in x from PO(x,y)).
- Is it possible for x to not be completely contained in z? Yes, if the part of x that's outside y is also outside z. This can happen because NTPPi(y,z) doesn't specify how far z extends beyond y.

So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This means x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Let's check if this is possible:
- Can x be completely contained within z? Yes, if the part of x that's outside y is still within z.
- Can x touch z's boundary? Yes, if the part of x that's outside y extends to z's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This means x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's check if this is possible:
- Can x be completely contained within z? Yes, as mentioned above.
- Can x not touch z's boundary? Yes, if the part of x that's outside y doesn't extend to z's boundary.

So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. 

Let's check if this is possible:
- Can z be completely contained within x? For this to be true, y would also have to be completely contained within x (since y is contained within z). But from PO(x,y), we know y is not completely contained within x. So z cannot be completely contained within x.

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. Since y is a proper part of z, and x and y only partially overlap, x and z can't be the same.

So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me think about this even more carefully. 

We're given:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
2. NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y share some interior points.
- Some points in x are not in y.
- Some points in y are not in x.

NTPPi(y,z) means:
- y is completely contained within the interior of z.
- No part of y touches the boundary of z.

Now, to determine if TPP(x,z) is possible, I need to check if x can be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary.

Let's break it down:
- Can x be completely contained within z? Since y is contained within z, the part of x that overlaps with y is also within z. For the part of x that's outside y, it's not immediately clear if it's within z or not. It's possible for it to be within z, and it's also possible for it to be outside z.
- Can x touch z's boundary? If the part of x that's outside y extends to z's boundary, then x can touch z's boundary.

So, it seems TPP(x,z) is possible if the entire region of x is contained within z, and the part of x that's outside y touches z's boundary.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x needs to be completely within z and not touch z's boundary. This is also possible if the entire region of x is contained within z, and the part of x that's outside y doesn't extend to z's boundary.

For PO(x,z), x and z need to share some interior points (which they do because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z), and neither can be completely contained in the other. We've already established that z is not contained in x. For x to not be completely contained in z, the part of x that's outside y must also extend outside of z.

So, it seems the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - if the part of x that's outside y also extends outside of z.
- TPP(x,z) - if the entire region of x is contained within z, and the part of x that's outside y touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z) - if the entire region of x is contained within z, and the part of x that's outside y doesn't touch z's boundary.

OK, I'm satisfied with this answer.

OK, actually, let's simplify this once more for clarity. If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then what is the relation between x and z?

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is fully contained within the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z.

For PO(x,z), x and z share interior points and neither is a subset of the other. Since y is a subset of z, and x shares interior points with y, x and z share interior points. For z to not be a subset of x, there must be points of z not in x. Since y is not a subset of x (from PO(x,y)), and y is a subset of z, there are points of z not in x. For x to not be a subset of z, there must be points of x not in z. This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y extends outside of z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z), x must be fully contained in z and touch z's boundary. Since the part of x that overlaps with y is already inside z, the only question is about the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. If this entire part is also inside z, and some of it touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds. This is a possible scenario. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x must be fully contained in z and not touch z's boundary. The reasoning is similar to TPP(x,z), but here, the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is also a possible scenario. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For the other RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z) is not possible because x shares interior points with y, which is inside z.
- EC(x,z) is not possible because y (which shares interior points with x) is inside the interior of z, so x and z must share interior points.
- TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because they require z to be contained within x, which contradicts the fact that y (which is inside z) is not completely inside x.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I am confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z, given the constraints PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me analyze what these relations tell us:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z; y is completely contained within the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's systematically check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible: Since y is inside z, and x shares interior points with y, x must share points with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible: Since y is in the interior of z, and x overlaps with y, x must share interior points with z (not just boundary points).

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: x and z share interior points (via y). z is not contained in x (since y isn't fully in x). And x might not be contained in z if parts of x outside y also extend beyond z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible: If all of x is contained in z, and the portion of x outside y touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible: If all of x is contained in z, and no part of x touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible: This would require z to be contained in x, but since y is contained in z and y is not fully contained in x, z cannot be contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible: For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible: Since y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y, x and z cannot be identical.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
