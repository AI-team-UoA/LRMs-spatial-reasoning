PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me break down what we know:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy the exact same spatial region.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Given that x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since x and y are coincident, they share the same spatial properties. If y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. 

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:

If EQ(x,y), then x and y are exactly the same spatial region.
If NTPP(y,z), then y is completely contained within z without touching its boundary.
Since x is exactly the same as y, x must also be completely contained within z without touching its boundary.
Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

So my answer is: NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given the stated conditions.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same region. Whatever spatial relation y has with other regions, x will have the same relation.

Since y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x is coincident with y, then x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
