PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, x is contained entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is contained entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

So we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, since x is contained entirely within y, and y is contained entirely within z, it follows that x is contained entirely within z. This means that x is a proper part of z, either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Let's determine which one it is. For TPP(x,z), x would need to touch z's boundary. For NTPP(x,z), x would not touch z's boundary.

We know that x does not touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)). 

If x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x could either touch z's boundary or not, depending on exactly how y is situated within z.

If y touches z's boundary at a point or region where x is not present (which is possible since x doesn't touch y's boundary), then x would not touch z's boundary, giving us NTPP(x,z).

On the other hand, if y touches z's boundary and x happens to be in that region where y and z touch (which seems impossible given NTPP(x,y), because x doesn't touch y's boundary), then x would also touch z's boundary, giving us TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me rethink this. If NTPP(x,y), then x doesn't touch y's boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y touches z's boundary. So x is inside y, which touches z's boundary at some point. Can x touch z's boundary?

For x to touch z's boundary, it would need to extend to the boundary of y at a point where y touches z's boundary. But since NTPP(x,y), x does not touch y's boundary anywhere. So x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z). We can definitively say that x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Wait, let me double-check this.

NTPP(x,y) means x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

If x is strictly inside y, and y touches the boundary of z, then x must be strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Actually, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider.

NTPP(x,y) means x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

So x is strictly inside y, and y is inside z, touching z's boundary. The question is whether x can touch z's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary, x would need to touch y at a point where y touches z's boundary. But since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary at all. Thus, x cannot touch z's boundary.

Since x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, we have NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think my reasoning has gone in circles. Let me approach this differently.

We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

From these, we know:
1. x is inside y.
2. y is inside z.
3. Therefore, x is inside z.
4. y touches z's boundary.
5. x doesn't touch y's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary, x would need to touch y at a point where y touches z's boundary. But from NTPP(x,y), we know that x doesn't touch y's boundary at all. So x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But wait, I'm not being careful enough. Let me make sure I understand TPP and NTPP correctly.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x does not touch the boundary of y.
TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.

So, let's reassess:
- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

From these, we know:
1. x is inside y (and hence inside z).
2. x doesn't touch y's boundary.
3. y touches z's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary, it would need to reach z's boundary. But x is contained entirely within y, and only some parts of y touch z's boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't reach those parts of y that touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x doesn't touch z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).

But just to be super-clear, let me check if there's any counterexample. Could there be a configuration where x touches z's boundary despite being NTPP to y and y being TPP to z?

No, that's not possible. If x is NTPP to y, it doesn't touch y's boundary. If y is TPP to z, y touches z's boundary. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't touch those parts of y that touch z's boundary, so x can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I want to re-check if this is correct by considering a simple example.

Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary, and x as an even smaller circle inside y but not touching y's boundary. In this scenario, x is NTPP to y, and y is TPP to z. And indeed, x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, making x NTPP to z.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me just double-check the reasoning one more time.

If NTPP(x,y), then x is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary.
If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary, x would have to touch y at the points where y touches z. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary at all (NTPP(x,y)), this is impossible.

Actually, I'm confused. I should take a step back and make sure I have a correct understanding of the relations:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but have no shared interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical.

With this in mind:

If NTPP(x,y), then x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's determine the possible relationship(s) between x and z:

Given that x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, it follows that x is a proper part of z. This narrows down the possible relationships to TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), x would need to touch z's boundary. For NTPP(x,z), x would not touch z's boundary.

Since y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), and x is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), can x touch z's boundary?

For x to touch z's boundary, x would need to reach z's boundary through y. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't reach the parts of y that touch z's boundary. Hence, x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to take a different approach. Let's imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, and x as an even smaller circle inside y.

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

There's clearly only one possible relationship between x and z here, and that's NTPP(x,z). Since x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside z, x must be inside z. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, x must not touch z's boundary.

But there's something important I need to clarify. The question asks for all possible relationships. It's not asking for the one relationship that always holds, but all relationships that could possibly hold.

I believe NTPP(x,z) is the only relationship that could hold, but let me double-check.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

Let's go through all RCC-8 relations and check if they're possible:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x is inside z.
2. EC(x,z): This would mean x touches z's boundary but has no interior overlap. Since x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, x can't touch z's boundary. So this is impossible.
3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z have a partial overlap, but neither is a proper part of the other. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is a proper part of z. So this is impossible.
4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. As I argued earlier, x can't touch z's boundary because x doesn't touch y's boundary. So this is impossible.
5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is inside z. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, x doesn't touch z's boundary. So this is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, z can't be a proper part of x. So this is impossible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, z can't be a proper part of x. So this is impossible.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x can't be identical to z. So this is impossible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually wait, maybe I can be more precise in my checking. 

If NTPP(x,y), then x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's check if TPP(x,z) is possible:
For TPP(x,z), x would need to be inside z and touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside z, x is inside z. But can x touch z's boundary?

For x to touch z's boundary, it would need to reach z through y's boundary. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't reach z's boundary through y. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Let's check if NTPP(x,z) is possible:
For NTPP(x,z), x would need to be inside z and not touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is inside z. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't touch z's boundary through y. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, but actually, let me double-check TPP(x,z) again.

For TPP(x,z), x would need to be inside z and touch z's boundary. 

Let's imagine a scenario:
z is a big circle.
y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at point P.
x is a small circle inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Can x touch z's boundary?

For x to touch z's boundary, it would need to reach z's boundary. But x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. The only way for x to touch z's boundary would be if y were to "stretch" or "extend" in such a way that part of y touches z's boundary and x touches that part of y. But if that were the case, x would be touching y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Let's double-check all RCC-8 relations again:

1. DC(x,z): Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is inside z. So x and z share interior points, making DC(x,z) impossible.
2. EC(x,z): For x to touch z's boundary, it would need to touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So EC(x,z) is impossible.
3. PO(x,z): Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is a proper part of z. So PO(x,z) is impossible.
4. TPP(x,z): As I argued, x can't touch z's boundary because x doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.
5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which is the case. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x, which is impossible since x is inside y, and y is inside z.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x, which is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical, which is impossible since x is inside y, and y is inside z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me be even more precise. Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y.
- x does not touch y's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z.
- y touches z's boundary.

Considering the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is inside z. So DC(x,z) is impossible.
2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but have no shared interior. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x and z share interior points. So EC(x,z) is impossible.
3. PO(x,z): This means x and z have a partial overlap, but neither is a proper part of the other. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is a proper part of z. So PO(x,z) is impossible.
4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, x can't touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.
5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside z, x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, z can't be a proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, z can't be a proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.
8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x can't be identical to z. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, wait, let me just make sure that I'm interpreting NTPP(x,y) correctly. We have:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That means x is a proper part of y, and x doesn't touch the boundary of y.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. That means x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.

So, in the context of RCC-8, NTPP means a region is a proper part of another region and does not touch the boundary.

Based on this, if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Is there any scenario where this doesn't hold? Let's think...

Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary, and x as an even smaller circle inside y but not touching y's boundary. In this scenario, x is NTPP to y, and y is TPP to z. And indeed, x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, making x NTPP to z.

Actually, there's one more thing to check. Is it possible for y to "wrap around" x in such a way that, even though x doesn't touch y's boundary, x somehow touches z's boundary?

For this to happen, y would need to have a "hole" or be a non-convex shape. But if y has a hole, then the boundary of that hole is part of y's boundary. If x were to touch z's boundary through this hole, it would be touching y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, the relationship between x and z is still NTPP(x,z).

Let me try to be as precise as possible and consider all the possible configurations.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Given these relationships, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, it's straightforward that x is a proper part of z. This narrows down the possibilities to TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), x would need to touch z's boundary. For x to touch z's boundary, there would need to be a point p such that p is a point of x and p is on the boundary of z.

Since x is a proper part of y, any point of x is also a point of y. So, if p is a point of x and p is on the boundary of z, then p is a point of y and p is on the boundary of z. This means y touches z's boundary at point p.

Now, if y touches z's boundary at point p, and x also touches z's boundary at point p, then x touches y at point p. But since p is on the boundary of z, and y touches z's boundary at p, then p is on the boundary of y. So, x touches the boundary of y at point p.

But this contradicts NTPP(x,y), which stipulates that x does not touch y's boundary. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Since x is a proper part of z and TPP(x,z) is impossible, the only remaining possibility is NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

OK, so to be clear, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y
- x does not touch y's boundary

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z
- y touches z's boundary

From these facts:
1. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x must be inside z (a proper part of z)
2. For x to touch z's boundary, it would need to touch y at points where y touches z's boundary
3. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary at all (by definition of NTPP), it cannot touch z's boundary

Let me check all possible relations:
- DC(x,z): Impossible (x is inside z)
- EC(x,z): Impossible (x cannot touch z's boundary)
- PO(x,z): Impossible (x is a proper part of z)
- TPP(x,z): Impossible (x cannot touch z's boundary)
- NTPP(x,z): Possible (x is inside z and doesn't touch its boundary)
- TPPi(x,z): Impossible (z cannot be inside x)
- NTPPi(x,z): Impossible (z cannot be inside x)
- EQ(x,z): Impossible (x and z cannot be identical)

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
