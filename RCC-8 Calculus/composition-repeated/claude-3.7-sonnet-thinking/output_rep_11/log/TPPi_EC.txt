PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

2. EC(y,z) means that y touches z at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.

Now, I need to figure out the possible relations between x and z.

Let's consider what TPPi(x,y) tells us about the spatial relationship between x and y:
- y is inside x (a proper part)
- y touches the boundary of x

And EC(y,z) tells us:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share interior points

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, z could have different spatial relationships with x:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since y is part of x and z touches y, z must at least touch x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. If z touches y exactly at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then z could just touch the boundary of x as well.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. If z partially overlaps with x, while still touching y at the boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This doesn't seem consistent with our constraints because y is inside x, and y touches z at the boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is even less consistent than TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is adjacent to y but still entirely contained within x except where it touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This isn't possible because z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x, so z can't be fully internal to x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. This isn't consistent with our constraints because y is a proper part of x and y externally connects with z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check these results with a more careful analysis:

For TPPi(x,y):
- y is a proper part of x
- y touches the boundary of x

For EC(y,z):
- y touches z at their boundaries
- y and z don't share interior points

1. EC(x,z): If z touches y at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then z would also touch x's boundary, making EC(x,z) possible.

2. PO(x,z): If z overlaps with x but neither is contained in the other, while z still touches y at the boundary, this is possible.

3. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that z touches y and y touches the boundary of x, z could be fully inside x except where it touches the boundary, making TPPi(x,z) possible.

4. DC(x,z): Since z touches y, and y is inside x, z must at least touch x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

5. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x and y touches z at the boundary, x can't be fully inside z (because y would then have to be inside z too, contradicting EC(y,z)). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. NTPP(x,z): For similar reasons as TPP, this is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since z touches y and y touches the boundary of x, z must also at least touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z were identical, then y would be a proper part of z, contradicting EC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Hm, I'm not entirely confident in this analysis. Let's be more careful.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is completely contained in x)
- y touches the boundary of x at some point

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share interior points

So, y is inside x, touching x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary. Let's consider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If y is inside x and z touches y, then z must at least touch x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is definitely possible if z touches y exactly at the point where y touches the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x, while still touching y at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, all of x (including y) would have to be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For similar reasons as TPP, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and also touches y at their boundaries.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that z touches y and y touches the boundary of x, it's possible for z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary only if z touches y at a point that's not on the boundary of x. But since y touches the boundary of x and z touches y at the boundary, z must at least touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. If this were true, then y would be a proper part of z, contradicting EC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful with NTPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. But if z touches y at y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, would z necessarily touch x's boundary?

Not necessarily. If we're talking about 2D space, for example, y could be a shape that touches the boundary of x at one point, and z could touch y at a different point on y's boundary. In this case, z would be inside x (because it touches y, which is inside x) but might not touch the boundary of x.

However, there's another constraint: y and z touch at their boundaries. This means there's at least one point that belongs to both the boundary of y and the boundary of z. Let's call this point p. If p is also on the boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x at p, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible. If p is not on the boundary of x, then z could be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

But wait, y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)). If p is not on the boundary of x, then p is inside x. But if p is on the boundary of y, then it can't be inside y (because boundaries don't count as interiors). So, if p is on the boundary of y and not on the boundary of x, then p is inside x but on the boundary of y.

Hmm, actually, I need to be very careful here about the definitions. In RCC-8, the relations are defined in terms of the topological concepts of connection and parthood, not in terms of interiors and boundaries. 

Let's use the formal definitions:

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y is connected to the complement of x.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are connected but don't share a part.

So, TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x but touches the "outside" of x. EC(y,z) means y and z touch but don't overlap.

If y is inside x and touches the outside of x, and z touches y but doesn't overlap with it, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Given that y touches the outside of x and z touches y, it's possible for z to be completely outside of x, just touching x at the boundary. This would make EC(x,z) possible.

It's also possible for z to partially overlap with x, making PO(x,z) possible.

Additionally, z could be completely inside x and touch the boundary of x, making TPPi(x,z) possible.

Could z be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x? If y touches the outside of x and z touches y, then z must at least touch the point where y touches the outside of x, which is on the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I need to be even more careful here. In RCC-8, regions are defined to be non-empty regular closed sets, which means they include their boundaries. The relation C(x,y) (x is connected to y) means that the closures of x and y share at least one point. Two regions overlap if they share a common part.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- P(y,x): y is a part of x, meaning every point in y is also in x.
- ¬P(x,y): x is not a part of y, meaning there's at least one point in x that's not in y.
- C(y, complement of x): y is connected to the complement of x, meaning y and the complement of x share at least one point.

EC(y,z) means:
- C(y,z): y is connected to z, meaning y and z share at least one point.
- ¬O(y,z): y does not overlap with z, meaning y and z don't share a common part.

Now, if y is a part of x, and y touches the complement of x, and y touches z but doesn't overlap with it, then what's the relationship between x and z?

Since y touches z and y is a part of x, it's possible for z to either touch x or overlap with x.

If z just touches x at the point where y touches the complement of x, then EC(x,z) is possible.

If z extends inside x (beyond just touching), then it partially overlaps with x, making PO(x,z) possible.

If z is entirely inside x except for touching the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) would be possible. But if y touches the complement of x and z touches y, then z must at least touch the boundary of x, ruling out NTPPi(x,z).

If z extends outside of x entirely, then DC(x,z) would be possible. But if y is a part of x and y touches z, then z must at least touch x, ruling out DC(x,z).

If x is a part of z, then TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would be possible. But if y is a part of x and y touches the complement of x, and y touches z but doesn't overlap with it, then x can't be entirely contained in z, ruling out TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

If x and z are identical, then EQ(x,z) would be possible. But if y is a proper part of x and y touches z but doesn't overlap with it, then x and z can't be identical, ruling out EQ(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

But let's look at TPPi(x,z) a bit more carefully. This would mean z is a proper part of x and z touches the complement of x. Given that y touches the complement of x and z touches y, it's plausible for z to be entirely inside x except for touching the boundary of x, making TPPi(x,z) possible.

Actually, I'm not sure about TPPi(x,z) and I think I need to use a more systematic analysis.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x
- y touches the boundary of x

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share interior points

Now, let's think about the constraints on the relationship between x and z:

1. Since y is inside x and z touches y, z must at least touch x. This rules out DC(x,z).

2. If z just touches the boundary of x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x, then EC(x,z) is possible.

3. If z extends both inside and outside of x, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. If z is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) would be possible. But since y touches the boundary of x and z touches y, z must at least touch the boundary of x or extend outside of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. If x is entirely inside z, then TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would be possible. But since y is inside x and y touches the boundary of z, x can't be entirely inside z without touching the boundary of z. This rules out NTPP(x,z). And if x is inside z and touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) would be possible. But since y is inside x and y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of z, x can't be entirely inside z. This rules out TPP(x,z).

7. If x and z are identical, then EQ(x,z) would be possible. But since y is a proper part of x and y touches z without overlapping, x and z can't be identical. This rules out EQ(x,z).

OK let's think even more carefully about this. 

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x
- y touches the boundary of x

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't overlap

So, y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. Also, y touches z without overlapping.

Regions that are "proper parts" can't share points with the exterior, only with the boundary. So y is entirely contained within x, including its boundary, and some part of the boundary of y touches the boundary of x.

Since y touches z without overlapping, they share at least one boundary point but no interior points.

Now, what does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): If y is inside x and y touches z, then z and x must at least touch. So DC(x,z) is ruled out.

2. EC(x,z): If z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z could just touch the boundary of x without overlapping with it. This makes EC(x,z) possible.

3. PO(x,z): If z extends both inside and outside of x, while still touching y at the boundary, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. But since y is inside x and y touches z without overlapping, x can't be entirely inside z. So TPP(x,z) is ruled out.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. For similar reasons as TPP, this is ruled out.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. Given that z touches y and y touches the boundary of x, it's possible for z to be entirely inside x and to touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. But given that y touches the boundary of x and z touches y, z must either touch the boundary of x or extend outside of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is ruled out.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. But since y is a proper part of x and y touches z without overlapping, x and z can't be identical. So EQ(x,z) is ruled out.

Wait, let's be even more careful in our reasoning. The key to this problem is understanding the constraints introduced by both TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. y is completely contained within x (all points of y are also points of x).
2. y is not equal to x (there's at least one point in x that's not in y).
3. y touches the boundary of x (there's at least one point that's on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x).

EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. This means:
1. y and z touch (they share at least one point).
2. y and z don't overlap (they don't share any interior points).

Now, given these constraints, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected; they don't share any points. Since y is part of x and y touches z, x and z must share at least one point. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, causing z to also touch the boundary of x without overlapping with it.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap; they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x, while still touching y at the boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This would require x to be completely contained within z and to touch the boundary of z. But since y is inside x and y touches z without overlapping, x can't be entirely inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would require x to be completely contained within z and not to touch the boundary of z. For similar reasons as TPP, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained within x and touches the boundary of x. Given that z touches y and y touches the boundary of x, z could touch the boundary of x, making TPPi(x,z) possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would require z to be completely contained within x and not to touch the boundary of x. Since z touches y and y touches the boundary of x, z might touch the boundary of x (if z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x) or might not (if z touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal; they occupy the same space. If this were true, then y would be a proper part of z. But since y touches z without overlapping, y can't be a part of z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I made a mistake. Let's re-analyze point 7:

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would require z to be completely contained within x and not to touch the boundary of x.

Given that z touches y (from EC(y,z)) and y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), is it possible for z to be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x?

If z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z would also touch the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) not possible.

But if z touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z could be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

Wait, I think I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let's use the constraint that in EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. So if y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)) and z touches the boundary of y (from EC(y,z)), then the points where y and z touch are on the boundary of y.

If a point is on the boundary of y and also on the boundary of x, then z touching y at that point would also mean z touches the boundary of x.

But what if y touches the boundary of x at one point, and z touches y at a different point on y's boundary? In this case, z could be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's be systematic:

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x
- y touches the boundary of x

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch
- y and z don't overlap

I'm trying to determine if NTPPi(x,z) is possible. This would mean:
- z is a proper part of x
- z doesn't touch the boundary of x

Let's think about a concrete example. Let x be a filled circle, and let y be a smaller filled circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at one point. Now, let z be another filled circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary but doesn't touch the boundary of x. In this case, NTPPi(x,z) would hold.

But actually, this scenario isn't consistent with EC(y,z). If y and z are both filled circles, and they touch, then they can't be externally connected; they would partially overlap. For y and z to be externally connected, they'd have to touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

So, let's rethink. If y is a filled circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at one point, and z is another filled circle that touches y only at a point on y's boundary (not at the point where y touches the boundary of x), then z could be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

Actually, I'm still not sure I have convinced myself of the correct set of relations here. Let me try to use a concrete example to think through this more clearly:

1. TPPi(x,y): Let x be a filled circle, and let y be a smaller filled circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at one point. So, y is a tangential proper part of x.

2. EC(y,z): Let z be a filled circle that touches the boundary of y but doesn't overlap with y. For this to be true, z and y touch at exactly one point on their boundaries.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

- If z touches y at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then z would also touch the boundary of x, making EC(x,z) or PO(x,z) possible.
- If z touches y at a different point on y's boundary and extends outside of x, then PO(x,z) would hold.
- If z touches y at a different point on y's boundary and is completely inside x, touching the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) would hold.
- If z touches y at a different point on y's boundary and is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) would hold.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check if EC(x,z) is possible. For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would have to touch at their boundaries without overlapping. If z touches y at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then z would also touch the boundary of x. But if z extends outside of x, then it's not EC(x,z) but PO(x,z). And if z is completely inside x, then it's not EC(x,z) but TPPi(x,z). So, for EC(x,z) to hold, z would have to touch the boundary of x without extending inside or outside of x, which seems impossible given that z touches y and y is inside x. But actually, if z touches y only at the point where y touches the boundary of x, and z is otherwise completely outside of x, then EC(x,z) would hold. So EC(x,z) is possible.

OK, I realize I have been going back and forth. Let me try to be methodical. I will first consider cases where y touches the boundary of x at one point. Call this point p_1. Then I will consider where z touches y at a point. Call this point p_2. Then based on the relationship between p_1 and p_2, and considering the shapes of y and z, I'll determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Case 1: p_1 = p_2
In this case, z touches y at the same point where y touches the boundary of x. So, z touches the boundary of x at point p_1. If z is otherwise completely outside of x, then EC(x,z) holds. If z extends both inside and outside of x, then PO(x,z) holds. If z is otherwise completely inside x, then TPPi(x,z) holds.

Case 2: p_1 != p_2
In this case, z touches y at a point that's different from where y touches the boundary of x. So, z doesn't necessarily touch the boundary of x at any point. If z extends outside of x, then PO(x,z) holds. If z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x at another point, then TPPi(x,z) holds. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x at any point, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, considering both cases, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me think about whether NTPPi(x,z) is possible again. For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z would have to be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. Given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), is this possible?

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, so y touches the boundary of x at least at one point.
EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, so they touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

If y touches the boundary of x at a point p_1, and z touches y at a different point p_2 on y's boundary, then it's possible for z to be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. But is this actually consistent with the constraints?

If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is completely inside x, touching the boundary of x at some points. If z touches y without overlapping, then z is not inside y. But z could still be inside x, touching y at a point on y's boundary that's not on the boundary of x.

So, it seems NTPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, after all this back and forth, the answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let's verify this answer by running through a couple of concrete examples. Suppose x is a disk, y is a smaller disk tangent to the boundary of x. 

Case 1: EC(x,z).
z is a disk that is outside of x, but touches the boundary of x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, z also touches y, but doesn't overlap with it, satisfying EC(y,z). And z touches x but doesn't overlap with it, satisfying EC(x,z).

Case 2: PO(x,z).
z is a disk that partially overlaps with x, and touches y at a point on y's boundary (either where y touches the boundary of x or at a different point). In this case, z touches y but doesn't overlap with it (satisfying EC(y,z)), and z partially overlaps with x (satisfying PO(x,z)).

Case 3: TPPi(x,z).
z is a disk that's completely inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point, and also touching y at a point on y's boundary (either where y touches the boundary of x or at a different point). In this case, z touches y but doesn't overlap with it (satisfying EC(y,z)), and z is a tangential proper part of x (satisfying TPPi(x,z)).

Case 4: NTPPi(x,z).
z is a disk that's completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x, and touching y at a point on y's boundary that's not where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, z touches y but doesn't overlap with it (satisfying EC(y,z)), and z is a non-tangential proper part of x (satisfying NTPPi(x,z)).

Hmm, but actually let me carefully verify the last case. If z is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x, and z touches y at a point on y's boundary, is this consistent with EC(y,z) and TPPi(x,y)?

TPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p_1.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

If z touches y at a point p_2 on y's boundary, and p_2 is not the same as p_1, then p_2 is inside x (since all of y is inside x). If p_2 is inside x and on the boundary of y, then z, which touches y at p_2, could also be completely inside x. And if z doesn't extend to the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) would hold.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

I've convinced myself that the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x (completely contained within x)
- y touches the boundary of x (tangential)

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share interior points (no overlap)

Let me analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible: Since y is part of x and y touches z, z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible: If z touches y exactly at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then z can touch x's boundary without overlapping x.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: z can partially overlap with x while still externally connecting with y.

4. TPP(x,z) - Not possible: If x were a proper part of z, then y (which is part of x) would also be part of z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible: For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible: z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary while externally connecting with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible: z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while touching y at a point of y's boundary that isn't where y touches x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible: If x equals z, then y would be part of z, contradicting EC(y,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
