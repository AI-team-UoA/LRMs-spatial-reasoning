PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given that TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's break this down:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, and touches x's boundary.

2. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z, and does not touch z's boundary.

Given these two relations, I need to determine what RCC-8 relation(s) can hold between x and z.

Let's think about this step-by-step:

- We know that y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- We also know that y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

This suggests that z must overlap with x to some extent, since they both contain y. However, the exact relationship between x and z is not immediately clear.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because both x and z contain y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is also not possible because both x and z contain y.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given our constraints, this is possible. Part of x (including y) can be inside z, while another part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Given our constraints, this is possible. x (which contains y) could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x (including y) is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given our constraints, this is not possible. Since y is inside z and y touches x's boundary, z must extend to x's boundary (and possibly beyond). So z cannot be completely inside x while also touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for similar reasons as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is not possible because y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Actually, let me reconsider 6 and 7. I think I got confused in my reasoning.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. But we know that y is inside z and y already touches x's boundary. So z must extend at least to x's boundary. But for z to be a proper part of x, z must be strictly contained within x, which seems to create a contradiction. So I think TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary. But again, y is inside z and y touches x's boundary. So z must extend at least to x's boundary, which contradicts the requirement for NTPPi. So NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Actually, I'm not sure if my reasoning above is correct. Let me try a different approach. Let's visualize the constraints and see what relations are possible.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

This means that z must extend beyond y in all directions by at least a small amount, because y doesn't touch z's boundary. And x must contain y, with y touching x's boundary.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. PO(x,z): This seems possible. x and z could partially overlap, with some parts of x outside z and some parts of z outside x. The overlap must include y.

2. TPP(x,z): This also seems possible. x could be completely inside z, touching z's boundary. Since y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, x's boundary must touch z's boundary at some point(s) that are not touched by y.

3. NTPP(x,z): This also seems possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This would require that the boundary of x (which is touched by y) is strictly inside z.

Let me reconsider the other relations:

4. DC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y.

5. EC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y, so they must share interior points.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? If y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then z must extend beyond y to x's boundary. But for z to be a proper part of x, z must be strictly contained within x. These two requirements seem contradictory. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Similar to the above, z must extend beyond y to ensure that y doesn't touch z's boundary. But if y touches x's boundary, then z might extend to or beyond x's boundary, which would contradict z being a proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? If y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, and x and z are the same, then we have a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think there's an issue with my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me revisit these.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z needs to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside z and y touches x's boundary, z must extend at least to the point where y touches x's boundary. But this doesn't necessarily mean z extends beyond x's boundary. It's possible that z is still completely inside x, touching x's boundary at the same point(s) where y touches it. So TPPi(x,z) could be possible.

Actually, I'm not sure about that. If y touches x's boundary and y is inside z, then z must contain the part of y that touches x's boundary. But for z to be a proper part of x, z must be strictly contained within x. These two requirements seem to create a contradiction.

Wait, I'm overthinking this. Let's approach it differently.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

We're looking for the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's use transitivity properties of RCC-8. The composition TPPi ◦ NTPP should give us the possible relations between x and z.

I need to recall the composition table for RCC-8. For TPPi ◦ NTPP, I believe the possible relations are:

- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This means that x can partially overlap with z, or x can be a tangential proper part of z, or x can be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me double-check by reasoning through a couple of examples:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if, for example, y is near the boundary of x, and z extends beyond x in some direction while x extends beyond z in another direction.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

I believe these are the only possible relations between x and z given the constraints. So, the answer is:

PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

Wait, let me double-check if TPP(x,z) is really possible. We know that y touches x's boundary. We also know that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So, x's boundary (at least where y touches it) must be inside z, not on z's boundary. This suggests that if x is inside z, it might not touch z's boundary, which would make NTPP(x,z) the only possible relation if x is completely inside z.

But wait, x could touch z's boundary at other points that y doesn't touch. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me check again. Is PO(x,z) really possible? 

PO(x,z) means that x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. Given that y is inside both x and z, they do share some parts. And since there are no constraints requiring one to be inside the other, PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's try thinking of a concrete example for each of these to make sure:

1. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a small circle that touches the boundary of a larger circle x. Now, z is a circle that completely contains y but doesn't touch y's boundary. z can extend beyond x in some direction while x extends beyond z in another direction.

2. TPP(x,z): Imagine y as a small circle that touches the boundary of a larger circle x. Now, z is a circle that completely contains both y and x, with x touching the boundary of z.

3. NTPP(x,z): Imagine y as a small circle that touches the boundary of a larger circle x. Now, z is a circle that completely contains both y and x, with x not touching the boundary of z.

I still need to check if these examples are consistent with the constraints TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). Let's go through them:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. In all three examples, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In all three examples, y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So the examples are consistent with the constraints. So I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. The examples I gave might be too simplistic and might not capture all the nuances of the constraints.

Let's revisit the constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For y to be tangential to x, y must touch x's boundary. For y to be non-tangential to z, y must not touch z's boundary. This means that z must extend beyond y in all directions by at least a small amount.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. PO(x,z): This is possible. For instance, if y is touching the left boundary of x, and z extends beyond y to the left, it could extend beyond x to the left, while x extends beyond z to the right.

2. TPP(x,z): This is possible. For instance, if y is touching the boundary of x, and z extends beyond both y and x, but x touches the boundary of z at some point.

3. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. For instance, if y is touching the boundary of x, and z extends well beyond both y and x, such that x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

I believe these are the only possible relations. Let's double-check by considering each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y, so they must share at least one point.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y, which is a region with interior points, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible as discussed above.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible as discussed above.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible as discussed above.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But if y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then z must extend beyond y to the boundary of x. But for z to be a proper part of x, z must be strictly contained within x. These seem to be contradictory requirements. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But again, if y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then z must extend beyond y to (or beyond) the boundary of x. This contradicts the requirement for z to be strictly inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, then x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z). I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, I was confused again when checking TPPi(x,z), and we should think about it more carefully.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. We know that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We also know that y touches x's boundary.

Given that y touches x's boundary and y is inside z, z must extend at least to the point where y touches x's boundary. But this doesn't necessarily mean z extends beyond x's boundary. It's possible that z is still completely inside x, touching x's boundary at the same point(s) where y touches it.

However, there's a contradiction here: if y doesn't touch z's boundary (as required by NTPP(y,z)), then how can z touch x's boundary at the same point where y touches it?

This indicates that TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly for NTPPi(x,z), if z were to be a non-tangential proper part of x, then z would be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. But we know that y is inside z and touches x's boundary. This means z must extend at least to x's boundary, which contradicts the requirement for NTPPi.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

So far my answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me go through a more abstract reasoning again. We have:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. We can think of this as x being made up of y plus some additional region, with y touching the boundary of x.

- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. We can think of this as z being made up of y plus some "buffer zone" around y, such that y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these, what's the relationship between x and z? 

- We know that y is inside both x and z. 
- We know that y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z.

This means that around the part of y that touches the boundary of x, z must extend beyond y to ensure that y doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, in this region, z extends beyond x.

But for the other parts of x and z, there's no clear constraint. x could extend beyond z in some areas, or z could contain all of x.

This is consistent with the three relations I identified: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

One last check: if we think about the "buffer zone" that z has around y to ensure that y doesn't touch the boundary of z, this buffer zone must extend beyond the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. This means that z must extend beyond x at that point. So, z cannot be fully contained in x. This eliminates the possibilities of TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) as relations between x and z.

So, I'm certain that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, I still have some uncertainty. Let me reason by examining a specific diagram. Imagine:

- x is a circle.
- y is a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- z is a circle that contains y but ensures that y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

In this setup, z must extend beyond x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. But z could be positioned in various ways:

1. z could extend beyond x in some areas, while x extends beyond z in other areas. This corresponds to PO(x,z).

2. z could completely contain x, with x touching the boundary of z at some point. This corresponds to TPP(x,z).

3. z could completely contain x, with x not touching the boundary of z. This corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

These are the only possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me try one more example. Consider:

- x is a square.
- y is a smaller square that touches the left boundary of x from the inside.
- z is a square that contains y in such a way that y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these, z must extend beyond x on the left. But the relationship between x and z on the right, top, and bottom is not constrained. So:

1. PO(x,z) is possible if z extends beyond x on the left, but x extends beyond z on the right.

2. TPP(x,z) is possible if z contains all of x and x touches the boundary of z on the right.

3. NTPP(x,z) is possible if z contains all of x and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

One last check. I'm looking at the composition table of RCC-8 to see what the composition of TPPi and NTPP should give. According to the table, TPPi ◦ NTPP = {PO, TPP, NTPP}, which confirms my reasoning.

So, the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

So my final answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z). The answer is in the form of the RCC-8 relation(s) that can hold between x and z given the constraints.

ANSWER:

To solve this, I need to analyze the implications of TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) on the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's determine which relationships are possible between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y, so they must share points.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y, which means they share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with some parts of x outside z and some parts of z outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, then z must extend beyond x at those points, contradicting z being inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for similar reasons as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
