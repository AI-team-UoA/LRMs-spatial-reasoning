PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share a common part, but neither is a proper part of the other.

Let's think about what the relationship between x and z could be. 

To help me think, let's visualize this. 
- x is a larger region that completely contains y, and y is not touching the boundary of x.
- y partially overlaps with z.

What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected. This is not possible, because if y is a part of x and y overlaps with z, then x and z must share some common part as well.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected. This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since y is a proper part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping. This means x and z share a common part, but neither is a proper part of the other. This is a possible relation between x and z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part. This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Can this be the case?
   If x is a proper part of z, then everything in x is also in z. We know y is in x, so y is also in z. But PO(y,z) means y is not a proper part of z. There seems to be a contradiction here. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part. This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Following the same reasoning as above, this is also not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part. This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. 
   Now, z shares a common part with y (because of PO(y,z)), and y is completely inside x (because of NTPPi(x,y)). So at least part of z is inside x. Also, z is not completely inside x because PO(y,z) means that z extends outside of y. Since y is not touching the boundary of x, and z is only overlapping with y, z could touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part. This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   Similar to the above reasoning, z could be completely inside x without touching its boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal. This means x and z are the same region. But if x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of x, then y should be a proper part of z. But PO(y,z) contradicts this. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. 
- We know y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- We know y and z partially overlap.

If z is a proper part of x, then all of z is inside x. But if all of z is inside x, and y and z partially overlap, and y is a proper part of x, then this situation is possible. For z to be a tangential proper part, it needs to touch the boundary of x. This can happen if z extends to the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is also possible given the constraints.

Wait, I think I need to be more careful. Let's re-examine PO(y,z).

PO(y,z) means that y and z share a common part, but neither is a proper part of the other. This means that part of z is outside of y. 

Let's again consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected. We've established this is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected. We've established this is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping. 
   y is a part of x, and y partially overlaps with z. This means at least part of z is inside x (the part that overlaps with y). Also, since y and z partially overlap, part of z is outside of y. If this part of z is also outside of x, then x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part. 
   This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then y (which is a part of x) is also a part of z. But PO(y,z) means y is not a proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part. 
   Similar to above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part. 
   This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since y and z partially overlap, and y is completely inside x, at least part of z is inside x. If the rest of z (the part that doesn't overlap with y) is also inside x, and z touches the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part. 
   Similar to above, if all of z is inside x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal. 
   We've established this is not possible.

Let me try again with a clearer approach.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

Let's use a specific example to guide our thinking. Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is another circle that partially overlaps with y.

There are several ways z can be positioned relative to x:

1. z can be partially inside x and partially outside x. In this case, PO(x,z).

2. z can be completely inside x and touching x's boundary. In this case, TPPi(x,z).

3. z can be completely inside x and not touching x's boundary. In this case, NTPPi(x,z).

Are there any other possibilities? Let's think. Can z be completely outside of x? No, because z overlaps with y, and y is completely inside x. 

Can x be inside z? No, because y is inside x, and if x were inside z, then y would be inside z as well, which contradicts PO(y,z).

Can x and z be equal? No, because then y would be inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z).

Can x and z be externally connected (touching but not overlapping)? No, because z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, so z and x must also overlap.

Can x and z be disconnected? No, for the same reason as above.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to extend to the boundary of x while still overlapping with y.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is also possible given the constraints.

So I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me just make sure: z is a proper part of x if and only if all of z is inside x. 

For TPPi(x,z), z must be completely inside x and touch the boundary of x. This is possible given the constraints.

For NTPPi(x,z), z must be completely inside x and not touch the boundary of x. This is also possible given the constraints.

For PO(x,z), part of z must be inside x and part of z must be outside x. This is also possible given the constraints.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm confused about TPPi. Let me revisit the definitions:

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means that z is a proper part of x (i.e., all of z is inside x and z ≠ x) and z touches the boundary of x.

Let's think geometrically. We have:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,y)).
- y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)).

For z to be a tangential proper part of x, all of z must be inside x and z must touch the boundary of x. 

Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to extend to the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), all of z must be inside x and z must not touch the boundary of x. This is also possible given the constraints.

And for PO(x,z), part of z must be inside x and part of z must be outside x. This is also possible given the constraints.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

That is my final answer.

Actually, wait, I think there's a problem with my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). 

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is inside x and z touches the boundary of x.

But PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, and neither is a proper part of the other. This means part of z is outside of y.

Now, given that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, all of y is inside x and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. If part of z is outside of y, there are two possibilities:
1. The part of z that's outside of y is still inside x. In this case, all of z is inside x, which could lead to TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
2. The part of z that's outside of y is outside of x. In this case, part of z is outside of x, which leads to PO(x,z).

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, I'm still getting the same answer. Let me try to visualize the problem again to make sure.

We're given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. This means they share a common part, but neither is a proper part of the other. So part of z is inside y, and part of z is outside y.

Now we want to know the possible relations between x and z.

First, since y and z partially overlap, and y is completely inside x, at least part of z (the part that overlaps with y) is inside x. What about the rest of z (the part that doesn't overlap with y)? It could be:

1. Completely inside x and not touching the boundary of x. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z).
2. Completely inside x and touching the boundary of x. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z).
3. Partially inside x and partially outside x. In this case, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

Are there any other possibilities?

Let's check the remaining relations:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected. This is not possible because y is inside x, z overlaps with y, so z must also overlap with x.

EC(x,z) - Externally connected. This is not possible because if y is inside x and z overlaps with y, then z and x must overlap, not just touch.

TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part. This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of z. But PO(y,z) contradicts this.

NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part. Similar to above, this is not possible.

EQ(x,z) - Equal. If x equals z, then y is a proper part of z. But PO(y,z) contradicts this.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I'm being stupid. 

TPP means that x is a tangential proper part of y, while TPPi means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e. TPP(y, x)). I'm being thrown by the naming convention.

Let me go through the relations one by one again:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. This means they share a common part, but neither is a proper part of the other.

Now let's consider the relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected. We've established this is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected. We've established this is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping. This is possible if part of z is inside x and part of z is outside x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part. This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of z. But PO(y,z) contradicts this.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part. Similar to above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part. This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if all of z is inside x and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part. This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if all of z is inside x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal. If x equals z, then y is a proper part of z. But PO(y,z) contradicts this.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Now let's just double-check that I'm not missing anything:

We know that NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

If x and z are disconnected (DC), then y and z would also be disconnected, but PO(y,z) contradicts this.

If x and z are externally connected (EC), then they only touch at their boundaries. But y is inside x and overlaps with z, so x and z must overlap, not just touch.

If x is a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP), then y would also be a proper part of z. But PO(y,z) means y is not a proper part of z.

If x and z are equal (EQ), then y would be a proper part of z. But PO(y,z) means y is not a proper part of z.

So the only possibilities are:
- PO(x,z): part of z is inside x and part of z is outside x.
- TPPi(x,z): all of z is inside x and z touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): all of z is inside x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So my final answer is the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some part, but neither is contained in the other)

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to consider how z can be positioned relative to x given these constraints:

1. Since y is fully inside x and z overlaps with y, at least part of z must be inside x.
2. The part of z that doesn't overlap with y could be:
   - Inside x but not touching x's boundary → NTPPi(x,z)
   - Inside x and touching x's boundary → TPPi(x,z)
   - Outside x → PO(x,z)

Let me check other possibilities:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because z overlaps with y, which is inside x
- EC(x,z) is impossible for the same reason
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z, but then y would be inside z, contradicting PO(y,z)
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible for the same reason
- EQ(x,z) would mean y is inside z, contradicting PO(y,z)

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
