PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this. We know that:
1. EC(x,y) - x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. EQ(y,z) - y and z are coincident, meaning they have the same spatial extent.

Given that y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they are effectively the same region. This means that the relationship between x and z would be the same as the relationship between x and y.

Since we know EC(x,y), and y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), we can conclude that the relationship between x and z would also be EC.

So, the possible relationship between x and z is only EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this: If two regions y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), then any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Since x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), and y is equal to z, then x must also be externally connected to z (EC(x,z)).

So, the answer is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space.

Since y and z are exactly the same spatial region (EQ relationship), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if EC(x,y) and y is identical to z, then x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
