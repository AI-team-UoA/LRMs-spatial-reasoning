PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully think about this problem. I am given two relations:

1. NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, y is contained entirely within x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.

2. NTPP(y,z): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is contained entirely within z, and y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, I need to determine what relation(s) could possibly hold between x and z.

Let's think step by step about the possible spatial arrangements:

1. Since y is properly contained within x (NTPPi(x,y)), and y is properly contained within z (NTPP(y,z)), we know that there is some overlap between x and z (at least the region occupied by y).

2. So the relation between x and z cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected).

3. Now let's consider the possible relations that could hold:

   a. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas, while they share the region containing y.
   
   b. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.
   
   c. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely contained within z and does not touch the boundary of z.
   
   d. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
   
   e. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.
   
   f. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same region). This is possible if both x and z exactly contain y and nothing more.

Let's analyze each of these possibilities carefully:

a. PO(x,z): Since y is properly contained within both x and z, it's possible that x and z partially overlap. For example, imagine x as a larger circle, y as a small circle contained entirely within x (away from x's boundary), and z as another circle that contains y but extends outside of x in some areas while being contained within x in others. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

b. TPP(x,z): It's possible that x is completely contained within z and touches the boundary of z. For example, imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle entirely within z but touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained entirely within x and away from x's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

c. NTPP(x,z): It's possible that x is completely contained within z and does not touch the boundary of z. For example, imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle entirely within z and not touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained entirely within x and away from x's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

d. TPPi(x,z): It's possible that z is completely contained within x and touches the boundary of x. For example, imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle entirely within x but touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained entirely within z and away from z's boundary (which means y is also away from x's boundary, satisfying NTPPi(x,y)). So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

e. NTPPi(x,z): Wait, this would mean z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But we know that y is entirely contained within z (NTPP(y,z)), and y is entirely contained within x but doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). This seems contradictory, because if z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y would be "doubly" contained within x, which doesn't make sense with the given NTPPi(x,y). Actually, I need to reconsider.

Actually, NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, so y is contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x. This doesn't contradict the possibility of NTPPi(x,z), where z is contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is contained within z. In fact, this arrangement is perfectly possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

f. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z occupy exactly the same region. Since y is properly contained within both x and z (NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)), this arrangement is possible if x and z are the same region. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

Wait, I need to be careful here. EQ(x,z) means x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same region, and y is properly contained within both (NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)), then we would have both NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z). But NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so we would have NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z). If x and z are the same (EQ(x,z)), then these two statements are consistent. So EQ(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let me reason more carefully.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But this is impossible because they both contain y, so they must overlap at least in the region occupied by y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But this is also impossible because they both contain y in their interiors, so they must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Imagine x and z as overlapping circles, with y being a smaller circle contained entirely within the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. Imagine z as a larger circle, x as a smaller circle entirely within z but touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within x but away from x's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. Imagine z as a larger circle, x as a smaller circle entirely within z and not touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within x.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. Imagine x as a larger circle, z as a smaller circle entirely within x but touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within z but away from z's boundary (and thus away from x's boundary as well).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. Imagine x as a larger circle, z as a smaller circle entirely within x and not touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within z.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This is possible. If x and z occupy exactly the same region, and y is properly contained within both, then the given relations are satisfied.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me check if each of these is truly possible by constructing a concrete example for each:

1. PO(x,z): 
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3.
   - z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 0.5.
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z, and x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): 
   - z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 5.
   - x is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1.
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z, x is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): 
   - z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 5.
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z, and x is properly contained within z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): 
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 5.
   - z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1.
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z, and z is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary. But wait, for NTPPi(x,y) to hold, y must not touch the boundary of x. In this example, y does not touch the boundary of x, so NTPPi(x,y) holds. And for NTPP(y,z) to hold, y must not touch the boundary of z, which is true in this example. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): 
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 5.
   - z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and z is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. EQ(x,z): 
   - x and z are both circles centered at (0,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
   Here, x and z are coincident, and y is properly contained within both without touching their boundaries. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Let's double-check my reasoning once more.

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful about these relations. Let me clarify the definitions one more time:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, y is completely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is completely contained within z and does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because they both contain y, so they must overlap at least in the region occupied by y.

2. EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is also impossible because they both contain y in their interiors, so they must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. Let's see if this is possible. We need:
   - Some part of x is outside z.
   - Some part of z is outside x.
   - x and z share some interior points (which must include y).
   This seems possible. For instance, imagine x and z as overlapping circles, with y being a smaller circle contained entirely within the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. Let's see if this is possible. We need:
   - x is completely contained within z.
   - x touches the boundary of z.
   - x and z are not equal.
   This seems possible. For instance, imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle entirely within z but touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within x and away from x's boundary (and thus away from z's boundary as well).

5. NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Let's see if this is possible. We need:
   - x is completely contained within z.
   - x does not touch the boundary of z.
   - x and z are not equal.
   This seems possible. For instance, imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle entirely within z and not touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within x and away from x's boundary (and thus away from z's boundary as well).

6. TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. Let's see if this is possible. We need:
   - z is completely contained within x.
   - z touches the boundary of x.
   - x and z are not equal.
   - y is completely contained within both x and z and does not touch their boundaries.
   This seems possible. For instance, imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle entirely within x but touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within z and away from z's boundary (and thus away from x's boundary as well).

7. NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Let's see if this is possible. We need:
   - z is completely contained within x.
   - z does not touch the boundary of x.
   - x and z are not equal.
   - y is completely contained within both x and z and does not touch their boundaries.
   This seems possible. For instance, imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle entirely within x and not touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within z and away from z's boundary (and thus away from x's boundary as well).

8. EQ(x,z) means x and z are coincident. Let's see if this is possible. We need:
   - x and z occupy exactly the same region.
   - y is completely contained within both x and z and does not touch their boundaries.
   This seems possible. For instance, imagine x and z as the same circle, and y as a smaller circle entirely within x/z and away from its boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let's be even more careful and draw out the constraints for each relation to see if they are truly possible:

1. PO(x,z):
   - NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap.
   
   Can all these constraints be satisfied simultaneously? Yes, imagine:
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3.
   - z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 0.5.
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z):
   - NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - TPP(x,z) means x is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary.
   
   Can all these constraints be satisfied simultaneously? Let me think...
   
   If y is properly contained within x and x touches the boundary of z, is it possible for y to not touch the boundary of z? Yes, as long as y is not in the part of x that touches the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z):
   - NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - NTPP(x,z) means x is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   
   Can all these constraints be satisfied simultaneously? Yes, imagine:
   - z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 5.
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and x is properly contained within z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z):
   - NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - TPPi(x,z) means z is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary.
   
   Can all these constraints be satisfied simultaneously? If z touches the boundary of x, and y is properly contained within z, can y still not touch the boundary of x? Yes, as long as y is not in the part of z that touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z):
   - NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - NTPPi(x,z) means z is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   
   Can all these constraints be satisfied simultaneously? Yes, imagine:
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 5.
   - z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3.
   - y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1.
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and z is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. EQ(x,z):
   - NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - EQ(x,z) means x and z are coincident.
   
   Can all these constraints be satisfied simultaneously? Yes, if x and z are the same region, and y is properly contained within this region without touching its boundary, then both NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, one more check. The problem says:

- If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's ensure I'm understanding the relations correctly:

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, y is contained entirely within x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is contained entirely within z, and y does not touch the boundary of z.

So, y is contained entirely within both x and z, and does not touch the boundary of either. Now, let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because they both contain y, so they must overlap at least in the region occupied by y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is also impossible because they both contain y in their interiors, so they must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Imagine x and z as overlapping circles, with y being a smaller circle contained entirely within the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. Imagine z as a larger circle, x as a smaller circle entirely within z but touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within x but away from x's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. Imagine z as a larger circle, x as a smaller circle entirely within z and not touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within x.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. Imagine x as a larger circle, z as a smaller circle entirely within x but touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within z but away from z's boundary (and thus away from x's boundary as well).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. Imagine x as a larger circle, z as a smaller circle entirely within x and not touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle entirely within z.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This is possible. If x and z occupy exactly the same region, and y is properly contained within both, then the given relations are satisfied.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Finally, let me confirm my answer with a few concrete examples:

1. PO(x,z): 
   - x is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 9} (a circle centered at origin with radius 3)
   - z is the set of points {(a,b) | (a-2)^2 + b^2 ≤ 9} (a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 3)
   - y is the set of points {(a,b) | (a-1)^2 + b^2 ≤ 0.25} (a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 0.5)
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is a valid relation.

2. TPP(x,z): 
   - z is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 9} (a circle centered at origin with radius 3)
   - x is the set of points {(a,b) | (a-1.5)^2 + b^2 ≤ 1.5^2} (a circle centered at (1.5,0) with radius 1.5)
   - y is the set of points {(a,b) | (a-1.5)^2 + b^2 ≤ 0.5^2} (a circle centered at (1.5,0) with radius 0.5)
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and x is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a valid relation.

3. NTPP(x,z): 
   - z is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 9} (a circle centered at origin with radius 3)
   - x is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 4} (a circle centered at origin with radius 2)
   - y is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 1} (a circle centered at origin with radius 1)
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and x is properly contained within z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a valid relation.

4. TPPi(x,z): 
   - x is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 9} (a circle centered at origin with radius 3)
   - z is the set of points {(a,b) | (a-1.5)^2 + b^2 ≤ 1.5^2} (a circle centered at (1.5,0) with radius 1.5)
   - y is the set of points {(a,b) | (a-1.5)^2 + b^2 ≤ 0.5^2} (a circle centered at (1.5,0) with radius 0.5)
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and z is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is a valid relation.

5. NTPPi(x,z): 
   - x is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 9} (a circle centered at origin with radius 3)
   - z is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 4} (a circle centered at origin with radius 2)
   - y is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 1} (a circle centered at origin with radius 1)
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z without touching their boundaries, and z is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is a valid relation.

6. EQ(x,z): 
   - x and z are both the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 9} (a circle centered at origin with radius 3)
   - y is the set of points {(a,b) | a^2 + b^2 ≤ 1} (a circle centered at origin with radius 1)
   
   Here, y is properly contained within both x and z (which are the same) without touching their boundaries. So EQ(x,z) is a valid relation.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me understand what these given relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

Since y is contained within both x and z, x and z must share at least the region occupied by y. This immediately eliminates two possibilities:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z cannot be disconnected
- EC(x,z) is impossible because x and z must share interior points (at least y)

Let me analyze the remaining possibilities:

1. PO(x,z): Possible. X and z can partially overlap, with y contained in their intersection.

2. TPP(x,z): Possible. X can be a tangential proper part of z, with y inside x away from boundaries.

3. NTPP(x,z): Possible. X can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

4. TPPi(x,z): Possible. Z can be a tangential proper part of x, with y inside z away from boundaries.

5. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. Z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

6. EQ(x,z): Possible. X and z can be identical regions, both containing y properly.
