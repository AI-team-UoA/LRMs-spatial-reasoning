PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out the possible spatial relationships between regions $x$ and $z$ given that:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z. This means y and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us about x and z:

From NTPP(x,y), we know that x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
From PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some parts, but they also each have parts that are not shared.

What are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   Yes, it is possible. Since y and z only partially overlap, there could be parts of y that don't overlap with z at all. If x is located in such a part of y, then x would be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z externally connect?
   No, this is not possible. Since NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch y's boundary, and any contact between x and z would have to be through y's boundary (since x is completely inside y), x cannot externally connect with z.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   Yes, it is possible. If x overlaps with the region where y and z overlap, but also has parts in y that don't overlap with z, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   No, this is not possible. TPP(x,z) would mean x touches z's boundary. But since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't even touch y's boundary, so it cannot touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, it is possible. If the region where y and z overlap completely contains x, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   No, this is not possible. TPPi(x,z) would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and z is not completely inside y (PO(y,z)), z cannot be completely inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   No, this is not possible. NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and z is not completely inside y (PO(y,z)), z cannot be completely inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   No, this is not possible. If x and z were equal, then z would be completely inside y (since x is), which contradicts PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

But wait, let me double-check my reasoning for PO(x,z). For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z need to share some parts, but neither can be completely contained in the other. We know x is completely inside y. The overlap between y and z creates a region that x could intersect with. But if x is completely inside this overlap region, then x would be NTPP(x,z), not PO(x,z). For PO(x,z) to hold, x would need to have some parts in the y-z overlap and some parts in y that don't overlap with z.

Let me be more precise. Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x is completely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
2. PO(x,z): x has some parts in the y-z overlap and some parts in y that don't overlap with z.
3. NTPP(x,z): x is completely in the y-z overlap, and doesn't touch the boundary of this overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is completely in the y-z overlap, and touches the boundary of this overlap.

But is TPP(x,z) actually possible? TPP(x,z) would mean x touches z's boundary. Let's consider this carefully.

The boundary of z intersects with y (since PO(y,z)). If x touches this intersection, it would be touching both y's boundary and z's boundary. But NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch y's boundary, so x cannot touch this part of z's boundary.

However, z's boundary might also go through the interior of y. If x touches this part of z's boundary, it would be TPP(x,z) because x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

But is it possible for x to touch z's boundary inside y, given NTPP(x,y)? NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This doesn't prevent x from touching z's boundary if that boundary runs through the interior of y.

So I think TPP(x,z) is indeed possible, and my previous analysis was incomplete.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x is completely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
2. PO(x,z): x has some parts in the y-z overlap and some parts in y that don't overlap with z.
3. TPP(x,z): x is completely in the y-z overlap, and touches z's boundary inside y.
4. NTPP(x,z): x is completely in the y-z overlap, and doesn't touch any part of z's boundary.

Actually let me try one more time to make sure, using a different approach. Let's use the fact that these are RCC-8 relations, and we could use a composition table to determine the possible relations between x and z.

In RCC-8, the composition of NTPP and PO is given by:

NTPP(x,y) âˆ˜ PO(y,z) = {DC, PO, TPP, NTPP}

This means that if NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the possible relations between x and z are DC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, let me check again whether TPP(x,z) is possible, since I had some doubt before.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
Given PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap.

The question is: can x be completely inside z and touch z's boundary, while still being completely inside y and not touching y's boundary?

Let's think about a scenario: suppose z cuts through y, so that z's boundary runs through the interior of y. If x touches this boundary of z inside y, then x would be TPP(x,z) (completely inside z, touching z's boundary) while still being NTPP(x,y) (completely inside y, not touching y's boundary).

So yes, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z (they share some parts but neither is contained in the other)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely in the portion of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), so it can't touch z outside of y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x partially extends into the y-z overlap region but also has parts in y that don't overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary (which could pass through y's interior).

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z): Not possible because these would require z to be inside x, but x is already inside y and z extends outside y.

7. EQ(x,z): Not possible because PO(y,z) means z cannot be equal to something completely inside y.
