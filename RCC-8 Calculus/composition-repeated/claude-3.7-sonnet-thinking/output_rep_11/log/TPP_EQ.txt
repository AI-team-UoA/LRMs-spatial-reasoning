PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

We are given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are essentially the same region. This means that whatever relationship x has with y, it should have the same relationship with z.

Given that TPP(x,y), we know that x is a tangential proper part of y. Since z is coincident with y (EQ(y,z)), x should also be a tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z should be TPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this by thinking about the properties of these relations:

- TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region
- Since y and z are the same region, x is also a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Therefore, TPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, let me be even more careful. The RCC-8 relations are:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (touch at boundary)
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP)
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP)
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), let's systematically check if any of these relations could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected, but we know x is part of y, and y is equal to z, so x must be part of z. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z are externally connected (touch at boundary), but we know x is part of y, and y is equal to z, so x must be part of z. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, but we know x is a proper part of y, and y is equal to z, so x must be a proper part of z. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. We know x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is equal to z. Therefore, x is a tangential proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But we know x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x touches y's boundary. Since y is equal to z, x also touches z's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But we know x is a proper part of y, and y is equal to z. This would lead to a contradiction where x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But we know x is a proper part of y, and y is equal to z. This would lead to a contradiction where x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. But we know x is a proper part of y, and y is equal to z. This would lead to a contradiction where x is a proper part of z, and x is equal to z. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

From this analysis, only TPP(x,z) is possible given the constraints TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Actually, I notice a potential flaw in my reasoning. Let me re-examine the implications of EQ(y,z).

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident or equal. This means that whatever properties y has, z also has, and vice versa. 

Given TPP(x,y), we know:
1. x is a proper part of y
2. x touches y's boundary

With EQ(y,z), these properties transfer to z:
1. x is a proper part of z (since y and z are the same region)
2. x touches z's boundary (since y's boundary is the same as z's boundary)

So, TPP(x,z) must hold.

To be absolutely sure, let me reason through one more time. In RCC-8:

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which implies that x is entirely contained within y and shares at least one boundary point with y.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.

Given these two, we can deduce:
- x is entirely contained within z (because x is contained within y, and y is the same as z).
- x shares at least one boundary point with z (because x shares a boundary point with y, and y's boundary is the same as z's boundary).

These two conditions match the definition of TPP(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

But wait, let me double-check if my understanding of the EQ relation is correct. The RCC-8 calculus defines EQ(y,z) as "y and z are the same region". This means they have the same interior and the same boundary.

If we take a step back, the RCC-8 calculus is based on the concept of regions and connections between them. The EQ relation means that two regions are identical in all respects.

Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. x is a proper part of y, meaning all of x is contained within y, but y contains more than just x.
2. x touches y's boundary, meaning at least one point on x's boundary is also on y's boundary.

With EQ(y,z), we know that z is identical to y in all respects. Therefore, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between x and y, which is TPP.

Hence, the answer is TPP(x,z).

Actually, it's important to think more precisely about what EQ(y,z) means. It means that y and z are the same region, not just that they are related in a similar way to other regions. It's a stronger condition than just saying they have similar properties.

Given TPP(x,y), x is a tangential proper part of y. With EQ(y,z), z is the same region as y. Therefore, x is also a tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, now that I think about it, I think the formal properties of RCC-8 include that EQ is an equivalence relation (which makes sense), and that composition of the relations follows a specific pattern. 

For the composition of TPP and EQ, we'd use the composition table for RCC-8. In particular, TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) would compose to give TPP(x,z). This is because EQ acts as an identity element in the composition.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Let me just double-check this understanding by trying a couple of examples. For the tangential proper part of relation, imagine:
- x is a small circle on the boundary of a larger circle y.
- y is coincident with z.

In this case, x is clearly a tangential proper part of z as well. This confirms my reasoning.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me check one more time against the properties of the RCC-8 calculus. The composition table for RCC-8 provides the possible relations that can hold between two regions x and z, given that certain relations hold between x and y, and between y and z.

For TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the composition table would give us TPP(x,z). This is because EQ acts as an identity element in the composition, meaning the relation between x and z is the same as the relation between x and y.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

One final time: In the RCC-8 calculus, TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) compose to give TPP(x,z). This is consistent with the intuitive understanding that if x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is the same region as z, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relations TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) combine to define the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since y and z are identical spatial regions (EQ(y,z)), any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. 

When x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is identical to z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
