PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this problem step-by-step.

We know:
1. DC(x,y) - x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
2. PO(y,z) - y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other

We need to find all possible relations between x and z, which could be any of the 8 RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Let's analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - This is certainly possible. If x is disconnected from y, and y partially overlaps z, then x can be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z) - This is possible. x could be disconnected from y but touch the boundary of z in an area where y doesn't overlap with z.

3. PO(x,z) - This is possible. x could be disconnected from y but still partially overlap with z in regions where y doesn't overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z) - This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems impossible because if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x would have to overlap with some part of z. But given that y partially overlaps with z, and x is disconnected from y, there would need to be some connection between x and y if x is inside z. But we know DC(x,y), so x cannot be a tangential proper part of z.

Wait, I need to reconsider this. If x is inside z but doesn't overlap with the part of z that overlaps with y, then TPP(x,z) could be possible.

Actually, I think TPP(x,z) is not possible. Here's why: If x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x touches the boundary of z. If y partially overlaps with z, then y must also extend outside of z. Given that x and y are disconnected, x cannot touch any part of the boundary of z that y crosses, because that would make x and y connected. However, since y partially overlaps with z, y must cross the boundary of z at some point. 

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. TPP(x,z) simply means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This can be true while x and y remain disconnected as long as the part of z that contains x doesn't overlap with y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and the region of z containing x doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which would imply that z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y partially overlaps with z, which means y shares some part with z. Since x and y are disconnected, z cannot be contained within x, because that would create a connection between x and y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. By similar reasoning as above, this is not possible because y partially overlaps with z, and x and y are disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z) - This means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would also partially overlap with x. But we know that x and y are disconnected, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y partially overlaps with z, we need to ensure that x and y remain disconnected. This is possible if the part of z that contains x doesn't overlap with the part of z that overlaps with y. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it's completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, as long as the part of z containing x doesn't overlap with the part of z that overlaps with y, x and y can remain disconnected. So NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

Let me think about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) again.

For TPPi(x,z):
This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, then y would necessarily overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, if z is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, then y would necessarily overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are the same region, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would also partially overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me carefully think about TPP(x,z) once more. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since we know DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need to ensure that x doesn't overlap with the part of z that overlaps with y. This is certainly possible, so TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, as long as x doesn't overlap with the part of z that overlaps with y, this is a valid possibility.

So, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me think about this problem more generally to make sure I have the right approach.

Given:
- DC(x,y): Regions x and y are disconnected.
- PO(y,z): Regions y and z partially overlap.

What I'm trying to determine is the set of possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's think about this by considering the layout of the regions.

Since y and z partially overlap, there are parts of y that are not in z, parts of z that are not in y, and a non-empty intersection of y and z.

Since x is disconnected from y, it means x doesn't share any point with y, including the part of y that overlaps with z.

Given this, x can be:
1. Completely outside both y and z, resulting in DC(x,z).
2. Touching the boundary of z (but not at a point where y and z intersect), resulting in EC(x,z).
3. Partially overlapping with z (but not with the part of z that overlaps with y), resulting in PO(x,z).
4. Completely inside z (but not overlapping with the part of z that overlaps with y) and touching the boundary of z, resulting in TPP(x,z).
5. Completely inside z (but not overlapping with the part of z that overlaps with y) and not touching the boundary of z, resulting in NTPP(x,z).

For the remaining relations:

6. TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, then y would overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, if z is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, then y would overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would also partially overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some interior points)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be completely disconnected from both y and z
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can touch the boundary of z in areas where y is not present
3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap with z in regions where y is not present
4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a tangential proper part of z without overlapping the region where y and z overlap
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a non-tangential proper part of z without overlapping the region where y and z overlap

The following relations are not possible:
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible - if z is part of x, and y overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y)
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - same reasoning as above
- EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x equals z, then y would overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
