PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We're given:
- TPPi(x,y) which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) which means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).

We need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are the same spatial entity. This means that any spatial relation that holds between y and any other object will also hold between z and that object.

So, if TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. And since z is equivalent to y, z is also a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, TPPi(x,z) must hold.

But wait, I need to double-check this. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. And EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident. 

So, z is equivalent to y, and y is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which is TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

I think the answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this one more time, using the definitions more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident.

If y and z are coincident, then z is the same spatial entity as y. And if y is a tangential proper part of x, then z is also a tangential proper part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

The answer is TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the composition of spatial relations.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are spatially identical. This means z has exactly the same spatial properties and relationships as y.

Since TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x.
Because z is identical to y (from EQ(y,z)), z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
