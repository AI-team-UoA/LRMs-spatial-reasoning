PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) mean.

TPPi(x,y) means that x is the inverse of a tangential proper part of y. In other words, y is a tangential proper part of x. That means y is a proper part of x, and y touches x's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now, let's figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's visualize the situation. We have:
- y is a proper part of x, and y touches x's boundary.
- y and z partially overlap.

We know that y and z overlap, so part of z is inside y. But y is completely inside x, so at least part of z must also be inside x. 

Let's consider the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know that part of z is inside y, which is inside x. So z and x cannot be disconnected. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But we know that part of z is inside y, which is inside x. So z and x must share interior parts. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. Part of z is inside y, which is inside x. But it's also possible that part of z extends outside x. In this case, x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But we know that y is a proper part of x, and y and z partially overlap. If x were a proper part of z, then y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So TPP is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to TPP, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible, if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible, if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. But we know that y is a proper part of x, and y and z partially overlap. If x and z were the same, then y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider this. I think I'm not being precise in my reasoning. Let's go through each relationship carefully.

We have TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is a subset of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
We also have PO(y,z), which means y and z share parts, but neither is a subset of the other.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): For x and z to be disconnected, they would have to share no parts. But y and z share parts, and y is a subset of x. So x and z must share parts. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, they would have to touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. But y and z share interior parts, and y is a subset of x. So x and z must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they would have to share parts, but neither would be a subset of the other. This is possible. Since y and z share parts, and y is a subset of x, x and z must share parts. And since z is not a subset of y, it's possible for z to extend outside of x, which would make x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would have to be a subset of z and touch the boundary of z. But y is a subset of x, and y is not a subset of z (since PO(y,z)). So x cannot be a subset of z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would have to be a subset of z and not touch the boundary of z. But as with TPP, x cannot be a subset of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would have to be a subset of x and touch the boundary of x. This is possible. Since y and z share parts, but z is not a subset of y, z can be a subset of x and extend to the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would have to be a subset of x and not touch the boundary of x. This is possible. Since y and z share parts, but z is not a subset of y, z can be a subset of x and not extend to the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would have to be the same region. But y is a subset of x, and y and z partially overlap, so z cannot be the same as x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this again. The key here is to understand what TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) tell us about the relationship between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That means:
- y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is completely contained within x, but is not equal to x).
- y touches the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. That means:
- y and z share some parts.
- Neither y nor z is a subset of the other.

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

First, y and z share parts, and y is a subset of x. So x and z must share parts.

Also, since PO(y,z), neither y nor z is a subset of the other. Since y is a subset of x, there are parts of y that are also parts of z and hence parts of x. But since z is not a subset of y, there can be parts of z that are not parts of y. These parts of z that are not parts of y could be:
- Parts of x that are not parts of y.
- Parts that are outside of x.

This gives us three possibilities:
1. All of z is contained within x, but z touches the boundary of x. This gives us TPPi(x,z).
2. All of z is contained within x, but z does not touch the boundary of x. This gives us NTPPi(x,z).
3. Some of z is outside of x. This gives us PO(x,z).

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible for the reasons I explained earlier.

Wait, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let me think about this again.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x.
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap.

Actually, there's a confusion because I believe I've been inconsistently using y as a part of x and also y as a part of z. Let me be more precise.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is completely contained within x, but is not equal to x).
- y touches the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z share some parts.
- Neither y nor z is a subset of the other.

So there are parts of y that are also parts of z. And there are parts of y that are not parts of z. And there are parts of z that are not parts of y.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- Since y is a subset of x, and y and z share parts, x and z must share parts.
- Since y is a subset of x, but z is not a subset of y, there can be parts of z that are not parts of y. These parts could be in x or outside of x.

So let's consider each relation:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know x and z share parts (through y), so this is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary. But we know x and z share interior parts (through y), so this is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share parts, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible if parts of z extend outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. But we know y is a proper part of x, and y is not a subset of z. So x cannot be a subset of z. Therefore, this is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is not possible because x cannot be a subset of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if all of z is contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if all of z is contained within x, and z does not touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. But we know y is a proper part of x, and y is not a subset of z. So x cannot be the same as z. Therefore, this is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I'm getting a bit confused thinking about this. Let me break this down step by step. Draw simple examples if necessary.

First, let's understand TPPi(x,y). This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is a subset of x, and y touches the boundary of x.

![Example of TPPi(x,y)](imagine a big circle x, and a smaller circle y that's completely inside x but touches the boundary of x)

Next, let's understand PO(y,z). This means that y and z partially overlap. So y and z share some parts, but neither is a subset of the other.

![Example of PO(y,z)](imagine the small circle y, and another circle z that partially overlaps with y)

Now, let's think about the relationship between x and z. We know:
- y is a subset of x.
- y and z share parts.
- Neither y nor z is a subset of the other.

So, we know that x and z share parts (because y is a subset of x, and y and z share parts). But we also know that z extends beyond y (because z is not a subset of y). 

The question is: where do these parts of z that are not part of y go? They could go:
1. Inside x but not in y.
2. Outside x.

Case 1: If all of z is inside x, then z is a proper part of x. The question then is whether z touches the boundary of x. If it does, then TPPi(x,z). If it doesn't, then NTPPi(x,z).

Case 2: If parts of z are outside x, then x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me make sure I'm not missing anything:

DC(x,z): Not possible because x and z share parts (through y).
EC(x,z): Not possible because x and z share interior parts (through y).
PO(x,z): Possible, as I've explained.
TPP(x,z): Not possible because y is a subset of x but not of z, so x cannot be a subset of z.
NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP.
TPPi(x,z): Possible, as I've explained.
NTPPi(x,z): Possible, as I've explained.
EQ(x,z): Not possible because y is a subset of x but not of z, so x cannot be the same as z.

So my answer is: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's make double sure. I'm going to trace through some examples:

Example 1: TPPi(x,z)
- x is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle, completely inside x, touching the boundary of x.
- z is a circle, partially overlapping with y, and completely inside x, touching the boundary of x.

In this example, TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) are satisfied, and we have TPPi(x,z).

Example 2: NTPPi(x,z)
- x is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle, completely inside x, touching the boundary of x.
- z is a circle, partially overlapping with y, and completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.

In this example, TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) are satisfied, and we have NTPPi(x,z).

Example 3: PO(x,z)
- x is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle, completely inside x, touching the boundary of x.
- z is a circle, partially overlapping with y, but extending outside of x.

In this example, TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) are satisfied, and we have PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I want to double-check that DC(x,z) is not possible. 

In DC(x,z), x and z are disconnected. But we know that y is a subset of x, and y and z share parts. So x and z must share parts, which contradicts DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Wait, I'm confused about EC(x,z). EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at the boundary but don't share any interior parts. But we know y is a subset of x, and y and z share interior parts. So x and z must share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait let me make sure I can demonstrate all the possible scenarios through a concrete example. I'll use a different notation to avoid confusion:

- X is a big circle.
- Y is a smaller circle, completely inside X, touching the boundary of X.
- Z is a circle, partially overlapping with Y.

So we have TPPi(X,Y) and PO(Y,Z). Now, the relationship between X and Z depends on whether Z is completely inside X or not, and if it's inside, whether it touches the boundary of X.

Case 1: Z is completely inside X and touches the boundary of X. This gives us TPPi(X,Z).
Case 2: Z is completely inside X but doesn't touch the boundary of X. This gives us NTPPi(X,Z).
Case 3: Z is not completely inside X (i.e., parts of Z are outside of X). This gives us PO(X,Z).

So the possible relationships between X and Z are indeed: PO(X,Z), TPPi(X,Z), and NTPPi(X,Z).

OK, actually I realize a concrete scenario for DC(X,Z) is not possible because Y overlaps with both X and Z. For the same reason, EC(X,Z) is not possible. 

Let's check for remaining relations:

TPP(X,Z) would mean X is inside Z and touches Z's boundary. But Y is inside X, and Y only partially overlaps with Z. So X can't be inside Z. Thus, TPP(X,Z) is not possible.

NTPP(X,Z) would mean X is inside Z and doesn't touch Z's boundary. Again, Y is inside X, and Y only partially overlaps with Z. So X can't be inside Z. Thus, NTPP(X,Z) is not possible.

EQ(X,Z) would mean X and Z are the same. But Y is inside X, and Y only partially overlaps with Z. So X and Z can't be the same. Thus, EQ(X,Z) is not possible.

So indeed, the possible relationships between X and Z are only: PO(X,Z), TPPi(X,Z), and NTPPi(X,Z).

So my final answer is: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to double-check another case as a sanity check. I was wondering if TPP(x,z) could be possible.

TPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's try to construct a case where:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x is inside z, then y is also inside z (because y is inside x). But if y is inside z, then it's not possible for y and z to partially overlap. So TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is inside z, then y is also inside z. But if y is inside z, then it's not possible for y and z to partially overlap. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible either.

And finally, EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then y is inside z. But if y is inside z, then it's not possible for y and z to partially overlap. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed only: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check that I haven't made a logical error in my definitions.

Checking TPPi(x,y):
- This means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is completely contained within x, but is not equal to x).
- y touches the boundary of x.

Checking PO(y,z):
- This means y and z partially overlap.
- y and z share some parts.
- Neither y nor z is a subset of the other.

So given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), we know:
- y is a proper part of x.
- y touches the boundary of x.
- y and z share some parts.
- Neither y nor z is a subset of the other.

Now, let's go through each relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But y is a part of x, and y and z share parts. So x and z must share parts. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary. But y is a part of x, and y and z share parts. So x and z must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share parts, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible if parts of z extend outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. But y is a part of x, and y and z partially overlap. If x is a part of z, then y is a part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But as with TPP, this contradicts PO(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if all of z is contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if all of z is contained within x, and z does not touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. But y is a proper part of x, and y and z partially overlap. If x and z are the same, then y is a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, now I realize I'm being redundant in checking my work. So I will stop here.

The possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z, given that TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me recall what these given relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share parts, but neither is contained in the other)

Now I'll analyze which of the 8 RCC-8 relations could possibly hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of x and y overlaps z, x and z must share parts.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of x and y shares interior parts with z, x and z must share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If z extends beyond x's boundary, they would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z, then y would be inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, y would be inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
