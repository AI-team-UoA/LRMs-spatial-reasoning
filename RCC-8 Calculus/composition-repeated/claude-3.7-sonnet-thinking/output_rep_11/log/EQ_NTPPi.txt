PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the situation:

1. EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident. In other words, x and y are the same region.

2. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. So z is completely contained within y, not touching y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Since x is the same as y (they are coincident), and z is completely contained within y, then z must also be completely contained within x. So z is part of x and does not touch x's boundary.

This means that the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is:
NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check this by going through the reasoning more carefully, because I think I might have made a mistake.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch y's boundary.

So, if x and y are the same region, and z is a proper part of y without touching y's boundary, then z must also be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

No, wait. I think I'm confused. Let me revisit the definitions of these relations.

- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident. They are the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. So, if NTPP(z,y), then z is also a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This means NTPP(z,x).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which can also be expressed as NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me reason through it again.

EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same, z is also a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually wait, I think I might be interpreting NTPPi incorrectly. Let me revisit the definition:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

I think I've been consistent, and the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, hang on, I have NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y (not y is part of z), and does not touch y's boundary.

Let's clarify this:

1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these two conditions, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), any relationship that holds between y and z should also hold between x and z.

Given that NTPPi(y,z) holds, which means NTPP(z,y), it follows that NTPP(z,x) should also hold, which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reason through this again to make sure I'm being clear.

EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.
NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, if NTPPi(y,z), then z is properly contained within y.

Since x and y are the same region, z is also properly contained within x. This means NTPP(z,x), which can be written as NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hang on. I think I've been confusing the order of the arguments in NTPPi.

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Wait, that's not right either. Let me clarify again.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, if NTPPi(y,z), then z is properly contained within y.

Since x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), z is also properly contained within x. This means NTPP(z,x), which can be written as NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I'm getting confused in how I'm expressing this. Let me try to be more precise:

- NTPP(a,b) means that a is a proper part of b and doesn't touch b's boundary. 
- NTPPi(a,b) means NTPP(b,a), which means that b is a proper part of a and doesn't touch a's boundary.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, and z is a proper part of y, z must also be a proper part of x. Moreover, since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x and y are the same, z doesn't touch x's boundary either. Thus, NTPP(z,x) holds, which can be expressed as NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check by thinking about concrete examples. Imagine:

- x and y are both a circle with a radius of 5.
- z is a circle with a radius of 3, and z is contained entirely within y (and doesn't touch y's boundary).

Since x and y are the same, z is also contained entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, NTPP(z,x) holds, which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Yes, I'm confident that the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more careful here. Let's revisit the definitions of these relations:

- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident. They are the same region.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Wait, this means y is inside z. But since x and y are the same, x is also inside z, and doesn't touch z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) holds.

I think I need to double check the definition of NTPPi again.

From the prompt:
"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same. Thus, z is also a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, NTPP(z,x) holds, which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I think I just got confused about the inverse relation.

OK so my answer is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step.

First, let's recall what the given relations mean:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same region)
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z:

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical regions with the same boundaries and interiors.

Since NTPPi(y,z) means z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary, and x is identical to y, then z must also be properly contained within x without touching x's boundary.

This means NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).
