PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that NTPPi(x,y), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, and does not touch the boundary of x.

We also know that EC(y,z), which means that y and z are externally connected. In other words, y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now we need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that y is completely inside x and does not touch the boundary of x, and y touches z at the boundary, let's consider the possibilities:

1. z could be completely outside x (DC)
2. z could touch the boundary of x (EC)
3. z could partially overlap with x (PO)
4. z could be a proper part of x that touches the boundary of x (TPP)
5. z could be a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x (NTPP)
6. x could be a proper part of z that touches the boundary of z (TPPi)
7. x could be a proper part of z that doesn't touch the boundary of z (NTPPi)
8. x and z could be equal (EQ)

Let's go through each of these possibilities and check if it's consistent with the given information.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know that y is a part of x, and y is connected to z. So x and z must also be connected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, z must extend outside of x. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, z must extend outside of x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This would require x to touch the boundary of z. But given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, it's not clear how x would touch z's boundary. However, it could be the case that z envelops both x and more, and x touches the boundary of z at some point not related to y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and more, with x not touching the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, z would also be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, z would also be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, y would also touch x's boundary if x and z were equal. This contradicts the fact that y doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to think more carefully about some of these cases. Let me re-examine them.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x must touch the boundary of z. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, if x were a tangential proper part of z, then y would have to touch the boundary of x where x touches the boundary of z. But this contradicts the fact that y doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must touch the boundary of x. But since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, if z were a tangential proper part of x, then z would also be inside x and not touch x's boundary. This contradicts the definition of TPPi. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's reconsider these cases.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. We know that y is completely inside x (and does not touch the boundary of x), and y is externally connected to z. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would touch the boundary of z, and be completely inside z. But since y is completely inside x, and y touches z, and y does not touch the boundary of x, it seems like x cannot touch the boundary of z where y touches z. It's hard to visualize a scenario where x is a tangential proper part of z, given the constraints. I think TPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. We know that y is completely inside x (and does not touch the boundary of x), and y is externally connected to z. If z were a tangential proper part of x, then z would touch the boundary of x. Since y is externally connected to z, y touches the boundary of z. Since y does not touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x where y touches z. But z could touch the boundary of x somewhere else. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. We know that y is completely inside x (and does not touch the boundary of x), and y is externally connected to z. If z were a non-tangential proper part of x, then z would be completely inside x and not touch the boundary of x. Since y is externally connected to z, y touches the boundary of z. So both y and z are inside x, and they touch each other at their boundaries. This is consistent with the given information. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me be more careful. Let's think about this more systematically.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Now, given these constraints, let's consider each of the 8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is a part of x, and y is connected to z, x and z must also be connected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries. Since y is a part of x, and y touches z, it's possible for x and z to touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Since y is a part of x, and y touches z, it's possible for x and z to partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and x must touch the boundary of z. But since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of z, it's hard to see how x could also touch the boundary of z. Let's say that x touches the boundary of z at point p. Then p is also a point on the boundary of x. But then, since y touches the boundary of z, it should also touch the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I realize that this is not quite right. If y touches z at point q, which is on the boundary of z, it doesn't necessarily mean that x also touches z at point q. It's possible that y touches z at q, but q is not on the boundary of x. However, since y is a proper part of x, and y touches z, x must also touch z (or overlap with it). 

I need to think again about whether TPP(x,z) is possible. TPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of x, y is also a proper part of z. We know that y touches the boundary of z. We also know that y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So y touches the boundary of z at some point that is not on the boundary of x. This seems to be consistent with TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and x must not touch the boundary of z. But since y is a part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, x must also touch the boundary of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I need to rethink this. NTPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x does not touch the boundary of z. If y is a part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, it would seem to imply that x also touches the boundary of z. But this is only true if the part of y that touches the boundary of z is also a part of the boundary of x. If y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, but the part of y that touches the boundary of z is not on the boundary of x, then it's possible for x to not touch the boundary of z.

Actually, I don't think this is possible. If y is a proper part of x, then the boundary of y is either entirely within x, or it intersects with the boundary of x. If the boundary of y is entirely within x, then y cannot touch anything that x doesn't touch. If the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x, and y touches z, then x also touches z.

Actually, this is still unclear. If y is a proper part of x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x (as given by NTPPi(x,y)), then the boundary of y is entirely within x. If y touches z (as given by EC(y,z)), and the point where y touches z is on the boundary of y, then that point is inside x, not on the boundary of x. So x and z overlap at that point, they don't just touch.

Let's visualize this: we have a region y completely inside a region x, not touching the boundary of x. We also have a region z that touches y at the boundary of y. The point where y and z touch is inside x, so x and z overlap at that point. 

Now, could x be a non-tangential proper part of z? If x is a proper part of z, then x is completely inside z. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This seems possible. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be a proper part of x and z must touch the boundary of x. But since y is a proper part of x, y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of z, it would mean that the boundary of z is entirely within x. But if the boundary of z is entirely within x, then z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let's think about this more carefully. TPPi(x,z) means that z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. We know that y is a proper part of x and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. We also know that y touches the boundary of z. If z is a proper part of x, then z is completely inside x. If z also touches the boundary of x, then part of the boundary of z coincides with part of the boundary of x. But then, if y touches the boundary of z at a point where the boundary of z coincides with the boundary of x, then y would also touch the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y).

However, if y touches the boundary of z at a point where the boundary of z doesn't coincide with the boundary of x, then there's no contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is possible if y touches z at a part of z's boundary that doesn't coincide with x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be a proper part of x and z must not touch the boundary of x. We know that y is a proper part of x, y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of z. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y can still touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with the given information. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. Since y is a proper part of x, y doesn't touch the boundary of x. If x and z are equal, then the boundary of x is the same as the boundary of z. But we know that y touches the boundary of z. So if x and z are equal, then y would touch the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I made a mistake again. Let me re-check TPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. We also know that y touches the boundary of z. If x is a proper part of z, then x is completely inside z. If x also touches the boundary of z, then part of the boundary of x coincides with part of the boundary of z. But since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, y cannot touch the part of the boundary of z that coincides with the boundary of x. But it might still touch some other part of the boundary of z.

Actually, wait, that might not be right, because the boundary of z might contain parts that are inside x. In other words, z might have a "hole" that is outside x. In this case, y could touch the boundary of z without touching the boundary of x.

Actually, I think I overcomplicated this. Let's go back to the definition. TPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. If y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then x must also touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Let me go back and re-check NTPP(x,z) as well.

NTPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. We also know that y touches the boundary of z. If x is a proper part of z, then x is completely inside z. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x is completely inside the interior of z. But then, if y is inside x, y is also inside the interior of z, so y cannot touch the boundary of z. This contradicts the fact that EC(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Finally, let me go back and re-check TPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. We also know that y touches the boundary of z. If z is a proper part of x, then z is completely inside x. If z also touches the boundary of x, then part of the boundary of z coincides with part of the boundary of x. But since y touches the boundary of z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, y must touch a part of the boundary of z that doesn't coincide with the boundary of x. This is possible. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Now let me re-check the list of possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, because y is a part of x and y is connected to z, so x and z must also be connected.
2. EC(x,z): Possible, because y is a part of x, and y touches z, so it's possible for x and z to touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): Possible, because y is a part of x, and y touches z, so it's possible for x and z to partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible, because if y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then x can be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, because if y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of z, then x cannot be completely inside the interior of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, because if y is completely inside x, and y touches the boundary of z, then z can be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, because if y is completely inside x, and y touches the boundary of z, then z can be completely inside the interior of x.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible, because if y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then x and z cannot be equal.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I was wrong about TPP(x,z). Let me try once more.

TPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. We also know that y touches the boundary of z. If x is a proper part of z, then x is completely inside z. If x also touches the boundary of z, then part of the boundary of x coincides with part of the boundary of z. Now, since y touches the boundary of z, and y is completely inside x, the point where y touches z must be inside x. But then, this point is both on the boundary of z and inside x. If this point is inside x, it can't be on the boundary of z at a place where the boundary of z coincides with the boundary of x (because such a point would be on the boundary of x, not inside x). But if this point is on the boundary of z at a place where the boundary of z doesn't coincide with the boundary of x, then this place must be inside z (because x is inside z). But a point can't be both inside z and on the boundary of z. This is a contradiction. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually I now see where the confusion lies. The definition of EC(y,z) is that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. So the place where y and z touch is on the boundary of both y and z. This point is inside x (because y is completely inside x). But this point cannot be on the boundary of z in a place where the boundary of z coincides with the boundary of x. So the boundary of z must have a part that is inside x. This means that z partially overlaps with x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

Now let me reconsider TPP(x,z). TPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. If x is a proper part of z, then x is completely inside z. But then, the point where y touches z, which is inside x, would also be inside z. But this contradicts the definition of EC(y,z), which says that y and z don't share any interior parts. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible either, because it would mean that x is completely inside the interior of z, which would mean that the point where y touches z is inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

Now let me re-check the list of possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, because y is a part of x and y is connected to z, so x and z must also be connected.
2. EC(x,z): Possible, because y is a part of x, and y touches z, so it's possible for x and z to touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): Possible, because y is a part of x, and y touches z, so it's possible for x and z to partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible, because it would mean that the point where y touches z is inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, because it would mean that the point where y touches z is inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, because if y is completely inside x, and y touches the boundary of z, then z can be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, because if y is completely inside x, and y touches the boundary of z, then z can be completely inside the interior of x.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible, because if y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then x and z cannot be equal.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Oh, I made another mistake! I need to be more careful. The definition of EC(y,z) is that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. This doesn't necessarily mean that the place where y and z touch is inside x.

Let's be very clear about the definitions and their implications.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So y is completely inside the interior of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. So y and z have at least one point in common, which is on the boundary of both y and z. But the interiors of y and z are disjoint.

Given these definitions, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is a part of x, and y touches z, x and z must also touch (or overlap). Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. Since y is a part of x, and y touches z, it's possible for x and z to touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Since y is completely inside the interior of x, and y touches z at the boundary of y, the point where y and z touch is inside the interior of x. So this point is on the boundary of y, on the boundary of z, and in the interior of x. If this point is in the interior of x, it can't be on the boundary of x. So this point is on the boundary of z but not on the boundary of x. Now, if z extends beyond this point, it would overlap with the interior of x, which is consistent with PO(x,z). So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. If x is a proper part of z, then every point of x is a point of z. In particular, the point where y and z touch is both a point of x and a point of z. This point is on the boundary of z. If x is a proper part of z, then this point is either in the interior of z or on the boundary of z. But since this point is on the boundary of z, it must also be on the boundary of x if x is to touch the boundary of z. But this means that y touches the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. If x is a proper part of z, then every point of x is a point of z. In particular, the point where y and z touch is both a point of x and a point of z. This point is on the boundary of z. But if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then no point of x is on the boundary of z. This is a contradiction. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. Since y is a part of x, and y touches z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, it's possible for z to be a part of x and touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Since y is a part of x, and y touches z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, it's possible for z to be a part of x and not touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, then y touching the boundary of z would mean y touches the boundary of x. But this contradicts NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I realize there's still a bit more to consider. I was thinking that the fact that EC(y,z) would imply that y must touch z on the boundary, and that this point must be inside x (since y is completely inside the interior of x). But I need to be careful: does the common point between y and z also have to be on the boundary of x?

If y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y is completely inside the interior of x. So every point of y is also a point of the interior of x. Now, if y and z are externally connected, then they have at least one point in common, which is on the boundary of both y and z. This point is also in the interior of x. So this point is on the boundary of z, but in the interior of x. This means that z extends into the interior of x.

So the possible relationships are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Now I'm doubting whether EC(x,z) is actually possible. Let's think again. 

If EC(x,z), then x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. We know that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, so y is completely inside the interior of x. We also know that y and z are externally connected, so they touch at their boundaries. The point where y and z touch is on the boundary of y, on the boundary of z, and in the interior of x. If this point is in the interior of x, it can't be on the boundary of x. But if this point is on the boundary of z, and x and z are externally connected, then this point should also be on the boundary of x. This is a contradiction. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually I'm being sloppy again. Let's be precise.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So y is completely inside the interior of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. So the intersection of y and z contains at least one point, and this point is on the boundary of both y and z. The interiors of y and z don't intersect.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is a part of x, and y touches z, x and z must also touch (or overlap). Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. We know that y is completely inside the interior of x, and y touches z at a point on the boundary of y. This point is in the interior of x. So this point is on the boundary of z, but in the interior of x. So the boundary of z extends into the interior of x, which means that the interior of z also extends into the interior of x. This means that x and z share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z). Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually wait, I think I just had a realization. Just because a point is on the boundary of z and in the interior of x, it doesn't mean the interior of z also extends into the interior of x. It's possible for the boundary of z to dip into the interior of x without the interior of z also dipping into the interior of x. So let's be even more careful.

The defining characteristics of the EC relation are:
- The regions share at least one point.
- The interiors of the regions do not share any points.

So if EC(x,z), then x and z share at least one point, and the interiors of x and z do not share any points. We know that y is completely inside the interior of x, and y touches z at a point p. This point p is on the boundary of y, and also on the boundary of z. It's also in the interior of x. So we have a point p that is on the boundary of z and in the interior of x. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the interior of z also extends into the interior of x. It could be the case that z is shaped in such a way that its boundary touches the interior of x, but its interior doesn't overlap with the interior of x. 

Hmm, but this is still a bit confusing. If a point p is on the boundary of z, it means that every neighborhood of p contains both points in the interior of z and points not in z. But if p is in the interior of x, every neighborhood of p contains only points in x. So if a neighborhood of p contains points in the interior of z, these points would also be in x, which means the interiors of x and z overlap, contradicting EC(x,z).

I think I've been making a conceptual mistake, and I should be more explicit about the topological definitions.

Let's use the formal definitions from topology:
- The interior of a set A, denoted int(A), is the largest open set contained in A.
- The boundary of a set A, denoted bd(A), is the set of all points that are in the closure of A but not in the interior of A. Equivalently, bd(A) = cl(A) - int(A).
- The exterior of a set A, denoted ext(A), is the complement of the closure of A. Equivalently, ext(A) = U - cl(A), where U is the universal set.

Now, using these definitions, let's redo the analysis:

We know that NTPPi(x,y), which means that y is a proper part of x and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So y is a subset of x, and y does not intersect with the boundary of x. This means that y is a subset of the interior of x.

We also know that EC(y,z), which means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. So the intersection of y and z is non-empty, the intersection of y and z is a subset of both the boundary of y and the boundary of z, and the interiors of y and z are disjoint.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, i.e., x and z have no points in common. But since y is a subset of x, and y intersects with z, x and z must also have points in common. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. So the intersection of x and z is non-empty, the intersection of x and z is a subset of both the boundary of x and the boundary of z, and the interiors of x and z are disjoint.

We know that y is a subset of the interior of x, and y intersects with z at a point on the boundary of y. Let's call this point p. So p is in the interior of x, and p is on the boundary of z. But if p is in the interior of x, then p is not on the boundary of x. So p is in the intersection of x and z, but p is not in the intersection of the boundary of x and the boundary of z. This means that x and z do not satisfy the definition of EC. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually I need to re-check the definition of EC(x,z). EC(x,z) means the topological closures of x and z intersect, but their interiors do not. The topological closure of a set A is the union of A and its boundary. So EC(x,z) means that the union of x and its boundary intersects with the union of z and its boundary, but the interior of x does not intersect with the interior of z.

So let's try again. We know that y is a subset of the interior of x, and y intersects with z at a point on the boundary of y. Let's call this point p. So p is in the interior of x, and p is on the boundary of z. Since p is in the interior of x, p is not on the boundary of x.

Now, if p is in the interior of x and on the boundary of z, what does that tell us about the relationship between x and z?

If p is on the boundary of z, then every neighborhood of p contains both points in the interior of z and points in the exterior of z. If p is in the interior of x, then every neighborhood of p contains only points in x. So every neighborhood of p contains both points in the interior of z and points in the exterior of z, and all these points are in x. This means that the interior of z intersects with x, and the exterior of z intersects with x. So x and z partially overlap. In other words, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. We've just shown that this is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is a subset of z, x intersects with the boundary of z, and x is not equal to z. We know that y is a subset of the interior of x, and y intersects with the boundary of z. Let's call the intersection point p. So p is in the interior of x, and p is on the boundary of z. If x is a subset of z, then the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z. But if the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, then p, which is in the interior of x, must also be in the interior of z. But p is on the boundary of z, not in the interior of z. This is a contradiction. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So x is a subset of z, x does not intersect with the boundary of z, and x is not equal to z. By the same reasoning as for TPP(x,z), this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is a subset of x, z intersects with the boundary of x, and z is not equal to x. We know that y is a subset of the interior of x, and y intersects with z at a point on the boundary of y. Let's call this point p. So p is in the interior of x, and p is in z. If z is a subset of x, and z intersects with the boundary of x, then there exists a point q that is both in z and on the boundary of x. So z can be a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is a subset of x, z does not intersect with the boundary of x, and z is not equal to x. We know that y is a subset of the interior of x, and y intersects with z. If z is a subset of the interior of x, then z does not intersect with the boundary of x. So z can be a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. So x is a subset of z, and z is a subset of x. We know that y is a subset of the interior of x, and y intersects with the boundary of z. Let's call the intersection point p. So p is in the interior of x, and p is on the boundary of z. If x and z are equal, then the interior of x is equal to the interior of z, and the boundary of x is equal to the boundary of z. But p is in the interior of x, and p is on the boundary of z. If the interior of x is equal to the interior of z, and the boundary of x is equal to the boundary of z, then p is both in the interior of z and on the boundary of z, which is a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check. I think the issue with EC(x,z) deserves a bit more scrutiny. Let's think again.

EC(x,z) means that the topological closures of x and z intersect, but their interiors do not. The topological closure of a set A is the union of A and its boundary. 

We know that y is a subset of the interior of x, and y intersects with z at a point on the boundary of y. Let's call this point p. So p is in the interior of x, and p is on the boundary of z. 

Now, if p is in the interior of x and on the boundary of z, and the interiors of x and z do not intersect (which would be the case for EC(x,z)), then the interior of z cannot contain any points from the interior of x. But every neighborhood of p contains points from the interior of z. Since p is in the interior of x, every neighborhood of p is a subset of x. So every neighborhood of p contains points that are both in the interior of z and in x. So the interior of z intersects with x. And since p is in the interior of x, the interior of z intersects with the interior of x. This contradicts the condition for EC(x,z) that the interiors of x and z do not intersect. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Let me check once more if there's anything I've missed. 

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, because y is a subset of x and y intersects with z, so x and z must also intersect.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible, because y is in the interior of x, y intersects with z, so the interior of x intersects with z, which means the interiors of x and z intersect, contradicting EC(x,z).

Actually, I was wrong about EC(x,z). Let me reconsider. EC(x,z) means that the intersection of x and z is non-empty, but the intersection of the interiors of x and z is empty.

We know that y is a subset of the interior of x, and y intersects with z at a point on the boundary of y, which we call p. So p is in the interior of x, and p is on the boundary of z. Since p is in both x and z, the intersection of x and z is non-empty. But we need to check whether the interiors of x and z intersect.

If p is on the boundary of z, it's not in the interior of z. But a neighborhood of p contains points in the interior of z. Since p is in the interior of x, a neighborhood of p is also in the interior of x. So a neighborhood of p contains points that are both in the interior of z and in the interior of x. This means the interiors of x and z intersect, which contradicts EC(x,z). Therefore, EC(x,z) is still not possible.

I think the key point is that if y is in the interior of x, and y touches z, then z must dip into the interior of x. And if z dips into the interior of x, then the interior of z intersects with the interior of x, which means x and z partially overlap.

Here's another way to look at it. If y is a non-tangential proper part of x, it means that y is completely contained in the interior of x. If y and z are externally connected, it means that y and z share at least one point, and this point is on the boundary of both y and z, but the interiors of y and z are disjoint. So there's a point p that is on the boundary of y, on the boundary of z, and in the interior of x. Since p is on the boundary of z, every neighborhood of p contains points in the interior of z. Since p is in the interior of x, every neighborhood of p is a subset of the interior of x. So there are points in both the interior of z and the interior of x, which means the interiors of z and x intersect. So x and z partially overlap.

Let me go through all the cases again to be sure:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, because y is a subset of x, and y intersects with z, so x and z must also intersect.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible, because y is in the interior of x, y intersects with z, so the interior of x intersects with z. And as we've shown, if a point p is on the boundary of z and in the interior of x, then the interior of z intersects with the interior of x, which contradicts EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Possible, because if y is in the interior of x, and y touches z, then z dips into the interior of x, which means x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible, because if x is a subset of z, and y is in the interior of x, then y is in the interior of z. But y touches the boundary of z, which contradicts y being in the interior of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, because z can be a subset of x, and z can touch the boundary of x at a place where y doesn't touch.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, because z can be a subset of the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible, because if y is in the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then y cannot be in the interior of z. So x and z cannot be equal.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Now I finally think I have the right answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what happens when NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) hold simultaneously.

NTPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x
- y does not touch the boundary of x (y is completely within the interior of x)

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries 
- y and z don't share any interior points

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of x and y touches z, x and z must have at least one point in common.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is in the interior of x and y touches z at its boundary, this point of contact is in the interior of x. This means z penetrates the interior of x, which contradicts EC.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Since y is in the interior of x and touches z, z can partially overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were a proper part of z, then y (which touches z's boundary) would have to be in the interior of z. This contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary at some point (while y is entirely in x's interior).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, then y would have to touch the boundary of x (since it touches the boundary of z), contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
