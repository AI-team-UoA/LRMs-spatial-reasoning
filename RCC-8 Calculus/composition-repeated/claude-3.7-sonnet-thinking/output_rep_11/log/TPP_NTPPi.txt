PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what these two relations mean:

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is completely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y.

2. NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y). NTPP means non-tangential proper part. So NTPP(z,y) means that z is completely contained within y and does not touch the boundary of y.

So we have the following:
- x is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.
- z is completely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's go through each of the RCC-8 relations and see which ones are possible:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y that don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if x and z touch within y.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x overlaps with part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is possible if x and z occupy the same region.

Actually, I need to be more careful. I need to take into account the constraints that we're given.

We know that TPP(x,y), so x touches the boundary of y.
We know that NTPP(z,y), so z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Let's reconsider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible because x and z can be separate regions within y that don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible because x and z can touch within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible because part of x can overlap with part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. But we know that z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary, x cannot be completely contained within z. So this relation is not possible.

Wait, let me think about this more carefully. 

x touches y's boundary, and z doesn't touch y's boundary. If x is completely contained within z, then x would have to touch z's boundary (because it can't touch y's boundary from inside z). But this means that x is a tangential proper part of z, which is TPP(x,z). So this is possible.

Hmm, I think I was confused. Let me draw this out more carefully.

TPP(x,y) means x is completely within y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(z,y) means z is completely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x would have to be completely within z and touch z's boundary. 

But wait, if x touches y's boundary and is completely within z, and z is completely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then how can x touch y's boundary? It doesn't make sense. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's think about each possible relation between x and z given these constraints:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y that don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if x and z touch within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x overlaps with part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be completely contained within z. So this relation is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be completely contained within z. So this relation is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be equal.

Hmm, I'm not sure if my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) is correct. Let me think about this more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would have to be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary. 

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would have to be completely contained within z and not touch z's boundary.

In both cases, x would be completely contained within z. Since z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, x would also be completely contained within y and wouldn't touch y's boundary. But we know that TPP(x,y), which means x touches y's boundary. This is a contradiction.

So, neither TPP(x,z) nor NTPP(x,z) are possible.

Let's try to visualize this situation. We have:
- y is a region.
- x is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.
- z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y that don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if x and z touch within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x overlaps with part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be completely contained within z. So this relation is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be completely contained within z. So this relation is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, it can be completely contained within x, which touches y's boundary. So this relation is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, it can be completely contained within x, which touches y's boundary. So this relation is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be equal.

Actually, let me reconsider the case of TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). 

For TPP(x,z), x would be completely contained within z, and x would touch z's boundary. Now, z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. But x touches y's boundary. If x is completely contained within z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x shouldn't be able to touch y's boundary either. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be completely contained within z and wouldn't touch z's boundary. Again, if z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x, being completely contained within z, shouldn't be able to touch y's boundary either. This is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), we're saying that z is contained within x. Since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't touch y's boundary, these relations are possible. 

Actually I'm still not sure. Let's think about it in a different way. Consider the following figure, where the rectangles represent the regions:

```
+------------------+ (y)
|                  |
|  +--------+      |
|  |        |      |
|  |  (z)   |      |
|  |        |      |
|  +--------+      |
|                  |
|     +-------+    |
|     |   (x) |    |
|     +-------+    |
|                  |
+------------------+
```

In this figure, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z). x touches y's boundary, so TPP(x,y). z doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(z,y).

Now consider this figure:

```
+------------------+ (y)
|                  |
|     +------+     |
|     |      |     |
|     | (z)  |     |
|     |      |     |
|     +------+     |
|                  |
|  +--------+      |
|  |   (x)  |      |
|  +--------+      |
|                  |
+------------------+
```

Here, x and z are disconnected again, so DC(x,z). x touches y's boundary, so TPP(x,y). z doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(z,y).

Now, let's consider a case where x and z touch:

```
+------------------+ (y)
|                  |
|     +------+     |
|     |      |     |
|     | (z)  |     |
|     |      |     |
|     +------+     |
|        |         |
|     +--+---+     |
|     |  (x) |     |
|     +------+     |
|                  |
+------------------+
```

Here, x and z touch at their boundaries, so EC(x,z). x touches y's boundary, so TPP(x,y). z doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(z,y).

Now, let's consider a case where x and z partially overlap:

```
+------------------+ (y)
|                  |
|     +------+     |
|     |      |     |
|     | (z)  |     |
|     |      |     |
|     +--+---+     |
|        |         |
|     +--+---+     |
|     |  (x) |     |
|     +------+     |
|                  |
+------------------+
```

Here, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z). x touches y's boundary, so TPP(x,y). z doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(z,y).

Now, let's consider a case where z is a tangential proper part of x:

```
+------------------+ (y)
|                  |
|     +------+     |
|     |  (x) |     |
|     |      |     |
|     | +--+ |     |
|     | |z | |     |
|     | +--+ |     |
|     |      |     |
|     +------+     |
|                  |
+------------------+
```

Here, z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary, so TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z). x touches y's boundary, so TPP(x,y). z doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(z,y).

Now, let's consider a case where z is a non-tangential proper part of x:

```
+------------------+ (y)
|                  |
|     +------+     |
|     |  (x) |     |
|     |      |     |
|     | +--+ |     |
|     | |  | |     |
|     | |z | |     |
|     | |  | |     |
|     | +--+ |     |
|     |      |     |
|     +------+     |
|                  |
+------------------+
```

Here, z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z). x touches y's boundary, so TPP(x,y). z doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(z,y).

Now, let's consider a case where x is a tangential proper part of z:

Hmm, this isn't possible. If x is completely contained within z, then x wouldn't be able to touch y's boundary because z doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction with TPP(x,y).

Now, let's consider a case where x is a non-tangential proper part of z:

Again, this isn't possible for the same reason as above.

Finally, let's consider a case where x and z are equal:

This isn't possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be equal.

So, based on our analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The impossible relationships are:
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

Actually, I realize I've been making a serious error in my reasoning. When I say "x touches y's boundary", I mean that there's some point on the boundary of x that is also on the boundary of y. Similarly, when I say "z doesn't touch y's boundary", I mean that there's no point on the boundary of z that is also on the boundary of y.

Now, let's reconsider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible, as shown in the figures above.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible, as shown in the figures above.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible, as shown in the figures above.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. If x is completely contained within z, and z is completely contained within y, then x is also completely contained within y. But we're told that x touches y's boundary, and z doesn't touch y's boundary. This is a contradiction, because if x touches y's boundary, and x is completely contained within z, then z would also touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to the previous case, if x is completely contained within z, and x touches y's boundary, then z would also touch y's boundary. But we're told that z doesn't touch y's boundary, so this is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible, as shown in the figures above.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible, as shown in the figures above.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means x and z occupy the same region. But we're told that x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The impossible relationships are:
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

But wait, let me reconsider my reasoning. I think my reasoning for TPP(x,z) is incorrect. I'm saying that if x is completely contained within z, and x touches y's boundary, then z would also touch y's boundary. But I think I was interpreting what "completely contained" means incorrectly.

Acually, I think my prior reasoning is correct. Let's clarify what "completely contained" means. If region A is completely contained within region B, it means that every point of A is also a point of B. In other words, A is a subset of B.

In our case, if x is completely contained within z, then every point of x is also a point of z. If x touches y's boundary, it means there's at least one point p that is both on the boundary of x and the boundary of y. Since p is a point of x, and x is completely contained within z, p is also a point of z. So, if p is on the boundary of y, then z also touches y's boundary. But we're told that z doesn't touch y's boundary, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, x cannot be completely contained within z, which means TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider this issue one more time. The definition of TPP(x,y) is that x is a tangential proper part of y. Here, "tangential" means that x touches the boundary of y from the inside. That is, there exists a point p such that p is on the boundary of x and p is on the boundary of y.

Similarly, NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. Here, "non-tangential" means that x does not touch the boundary of y. That is, there does not exist a point p such that p is on the boundary of x and p is on the boundary of y.

Now, let's go back to our problem. We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. There exists a point p such that p is on the boundary of x and p is on the boundary of y.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. There does not exist a point q such that q is on the boundary of z and q is on the boundary of y.

Now, let's consider the case of TPP(x,z), which means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and z is a proper part of y, then x is also a proper part of y. But we're told that x is a tangential proper part of y, which means there's a point p on the boundary of x that is also on the boundary of y. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then every point of x, including p, is a point of z. So, p is a point of z. But p is also on the boundary of y, which means z touches the boundary of y. This contradicts the fact that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, the same contradiction arises. If x is a proper part of z, and there's a point p on the boundary of x that is also on the boundary of y, then p is also a point of z. So, z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts the fact that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, I have been correct in my earlier deduction that TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible. And the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The impossible relationships are:
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

So our final answer is:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Is x disconnected from z?
   No, this isn't possible. Since y is inside z, and x is inside y, x must also be inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Does x touch z's boundary?
   No, because x is inside y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Do x and z partially overlap?
   No, because x is completely inside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Is x a tangential proper part of z?
   Yes! x is inside z and must touch z's boundary (because x touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): Is x a non-tangential proper part of z?
   No, because x touches y's boundary, which touches z's boundary, so x can't be non-tangential to z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is z a tangential proper part of x?
   No, z contains y which contains x, so z cannot be part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is z a non-tangential proper part of x?
   No, z contains y which contains x, so z cannot be part of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Are x and z equal?
   No, because z contains y which contains x, so z is larger than x.
