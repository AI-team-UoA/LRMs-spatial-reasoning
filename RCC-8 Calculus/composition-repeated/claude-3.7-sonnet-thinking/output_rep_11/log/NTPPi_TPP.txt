PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider each of these relations.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. Alternatively, we can say that x contains y completely in its interior.

TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, I need to figure out the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's visualize this. 
- y is properly contained within x (not touching x's boundary)
- y is part of z and touches z's boundary

What does this tell us about x and z?

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with the given information:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But we know y is in the interior of x and also part of z, so x and z must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This seems possible. x contains y completely in its interior, and y is part of z and touches z's boundary. So, z could extend beyond y in some direction, and x could also extend beyond y in some other direction, resulting in a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This would require x to be completely within z and to touch z's boundary. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z and is completely contained within x's interior, it's possible for x to also be contained within z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would require x to be completely within z's interior. This seems possible. If z is large enough to contain both x and some additional space, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would hold.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This would require z to be completely within x and touch x's boundary. But we know y is part of z and is completely in the interior of x. If z extends from y to touch x's boundary, TPPi(x,z) could hold. But if z extends beyond x in some direction, this wouldn't hold. So TPPi(x,z) is possible under certain conditions.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would require z to be completely within x's interior. But given that y touches z's boundary, and y is in the interior of x, it seems z might extend to touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) might not hold. Actually, let me think about this more carefully. If z is completely contained within x's interior, and y is tangential to z, then y would be within z, which is within x's interior. This seems consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. But given the constraints, it's unclear if this is possible. We know y is properly contained within x, and y is a tangential proper part of z. I think x and z could be the same if y is the only part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary. But this doesn't seem likely given the constraints. Let me think about this more... Actually, if x = z, then TPP(y,z) would mean TPP(y,x), which contradicts NTPPi(x,y) (which means NTPP(y,x)). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me reconsider NTPPi(x,z).
NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is non-tangentially properly contained in x. However, we know TPP(y,z), which means y touches the boundary of z. If z were non-tangentially properly contained in x, then z would be completely in the interior of x, away from x's boundary. This would mean y is also in the interior of x, away from x's boundary, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) (or NTPP(y,x)). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

And upon futher reflection, TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z touches the boundary of x. But if z touches the boundary of x, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then y might end up touching the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y) (or NTPP(y,x)). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let's be even more careful about TPPi(x,z). This means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is completely within x but touches x's boundary. We also know TPP(y,z), which means y is completely within z but touches z's boundary. But wait, if z touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary at the same point, then y would also touch x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). However, if y touches z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary, then y would still be in the interior of x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible under certain conditions.

Let me really think about this TPPi(x,z) case. TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is tangentially properly contained in x. This means z touches the boundary of x. We also know TPP(y,z), which means y touches the boundary of z. If y touches the boundary of z at a point where z touches the boundary of x, then y would also touch the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). So, y must touch the boundary of z at a point where z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Wait, upon reflection, I think my analysis of TPPi(x,z) is still incorrect. Let's be very precise.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely within the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely within z and touches z's boundary.

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely within x and touches x's boundary.

So, if z touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, can y still not touch x's boundary? Let's think about this spatially. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary at some point, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some other point (not where z touches x), then y would still be inside both z and x, and would touch z's boundary but not x's boundary. This is consistent with both TPP(y,z) and NTPPi(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me draw this out visually. I'll use the notation where [] is the boundary:

```
x = [      ]
z =   [    ]
y =     []
```

In this case, y touches the boundary of z, z touches the boundary of x, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x. This satisfies all the conditions: NTPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

I believe the correct answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. PO(x,z): Partial overlap.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me verify that the remaining 3 relations are all impossible, to double-check:

DC(x,z): This is impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they cannot be disconnected.

EC(x,z): This is impossible because y is in the interior of x and also part of z, so x and z must share interior points.

EQ(x,z): If x = z, then TPP(y,z) would mean TPP(y,x), which contradicts NTPPi(x,y) because NTPP(y,x) and TPP(y,x) cannot both be true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I'm not feeling confident about some of these. Let me check some of these again. 

Let's start with NTPP(x, z), which would imply x is non-tangentially properly contained in z.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely within the interior of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

If x is completely within the interior of z, then any part of x (including y) is also within the interior of z. But we're told that y touches the boundary of z. This is a contradiction. So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

Let's now check TPP(x, z), which would imply x is tangentially properly contained in z.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely within the interior of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

If x is tangentially properly contained in z, then x touches the boundary of z. Also, y is completely within the interior of x, so y doesn't touch the boundary of x. But we're told that y touches the boundary of z. This would mean y touches the boundary of z where x also touches the boundary of z. But then, y would also touch the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is also impossible.

Actually, let me be more careful. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely within z and touches z's boundary. It doesn't necessarily mean that x touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary. If x touches z's boundary at a different point than where y touches z's boundary, then y can still be completely within the interior of x (satisfying NTPPi(x,y)) and also touch the boundary of z (satisfying TPP(y,z)). So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

Let's double-check my logic for TPP(x,z) once more.

TPP(x,z) means x is completely within z and touches z's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely within the interior of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is completely within z and touches z's boundary.

If x touches the boundary of z, and y is within the interior of x, how can y also touch the boundary of z? This would mean y touches the boundary of z through x, which would also mean y touches the boundary of x. But this contradicts NTPPi(x,y), which states y is completely within the interior of x. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Wait, let me really draw this out. If x touches the boundary of z at one point, and y is completely within x, y could still touch the boundary of z at another point. Let's visualize this:

```
z = [                    ]
x =     [            ]
y =       [  ] <---- This y touches the boundary of z at a different point than where x touches the boundary of z.
```

In this case, y is completely within x, and both x and y touch the boundary of z at different points. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think there's a subtle issue with the diagram I just drew. If y touches the boundary of z, and y is completely within x, then x must extend all the way to the boundary of z at the point where y touches it. Let's redraw:

```
z = [                    ]
x =     [        ]
y =       [      ] <---- Here, y touches the boundary of z, so x must also touch the boundary of z at the same point.
```

But now, if y touches the boundary of z, and x extends to that same point, then y would also touch the boundary of x. This contradicts NTPPi(x,y), which states y is completely within the interior of x.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

OK, let me go through the possibilities again systematically, being very precise about the definitions.

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But we know y is in the interior of x and also part of z, so x and z must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. Given that y is in the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y is part of z (from TPP(y,z)), there's definitely some overlap between x and z. For it to be a partial overlap, x must extend beyond z in some parts and z must extend beyond x in other parts. This is consistent with the given constraints. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. Let's think about this more carefully. If x is tangential to z, it means x touches the boundary of z. Also, y is in the interior of x. If y is a tangential proper part of z, it means y touches the boundary of z. If both x and y touch the boundary of z, it's possible that y touches the boundary of z at a point where x also touches the boundary of z. In that case, y would also touch the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). Let's check if there's a way around this contradiction.

I'm picturing this:
```
z = [                          ]
x =     [              ]
y =         [      ]
```

Where x touches the boundary of z at the left edge, and y is completely within the interior of x. But if y is to be a tangential proper part of z, it needs to touch the boundary of z. The only way it can do this is if it extends to the boundary of z, which would also mean it extends to the boundary of x, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, there's another possibility: The region where y touches the boundary of z is not where x touches the boundary of z. Let's visualize this:

```
z = [                          ]
x =     [              ]
y =         [          ]<---y extends to the right and touches the boundary of z, but doesn't touch the boundary of x.
```

But this doesn't work either. If y touches the boundary of z on the right, and y is completely within x, then x must also extend to the boundary of z on the right. If x touches the boundary of z at the same point as y, and y is within x, then y would also touch the boundary of x, contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely within the interior of z. If x is within the interior of z, and y is within the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), then y is also within the interior of z. But this contradicts TPP(y,z), which says y touches the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely within x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, it means y touches the boundary of z. I need to check if this can be consistent with y being in the interior of x.

I'm picturing this:
```
x = [                              ]
z =     [                  ]
y =         [          ]
```

Here, z touches the boundary of x on the left, y touches the boundary of z on the left, but y is still in the interior of x. This seems consistent. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

But let's check another possibility:
```
x = [                              ]
z =     [                  ]
y =                 [      ]<---y touches the boundary of z on the right, and is in the interior of x.
```

This also works. So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely within the interior of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, it means y touches the boundary of z. Since z is within the interior of x, y would also be within the interior of x. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. But if x = z, then TPP(y,z) would mean TPP(y,x), which contradicts NTPPi(x,y) (because NTPP(y,x) and TPP(y,x) cannot both be true). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partial overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Alright, that's the revised answer. Let's do one final check:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible. y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible. y is in the interior of x and also part of z, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Given that y is in the interior of x and y is part of z, there's some overlap between x and z. For it to be a partial overlap, x must extend beyond z in some parts and z must extend beyond x in other parts, which is consistent with the constraints.

4. TPP(x,z): Impossible. If x is tangential to z, it means x touches the boundary of z. If y is a tangential proper part of z, it means y touches the boundary of z. If both x and y touch the boundary of z, and y is in the interior of x, then y would also touch the boundary of x at the point where both x and y touch the boundary of z. This contradicts NTPPi(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x (and by extension, y) is completely within the interior of z. But this contradicts TPP(y,z), which says y touches the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely within x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, it touches the boundary of z. This is consistent with y being in the interior of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely within the interior of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, it touches the boundary of z. Since z is within the interior of x, y would also be within the interior of x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x = z, then TPP(y,z) would mean TPP(y,x), which contradicts NTPPi(x,y) (because NTPP(y,x) and TPP(y,x) cannot both be true).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partial overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I have to be careful to avoid making an error in my reasoning. Let me double-check one more time.

Let's think about PO(x,z). This means x and z partially overlap, i.e., neither is a proper part of the other. Given that y is a non-tangential proper part of x and a tangential proper part of z, there's definitely some overlap between x and z. For it to be a partial overlap, z must extend beyond x in some parts. But is it possible for x to extend beyond z in other parts? Yes, that's consistent with the constraints. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

Let's think about TPPi(x,z). This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, y touches the boundary of z. Since z is within x and touches the boundary of x, y can touch the boundary of z within the interior of x. This is consistent with the constraints. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let's think about NTPPi(x,z). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, y touches the boundary of z. Since z is within the interior of x, y would also be within the interior of x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So my final answer is:
- PO(x,z): Partial overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly contained within x's interior (not touching x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Let me examine each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible because y is in the interior of x and also part of z, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z partially overlap since they share y, and it's consistent that each extends beyond the other in different directions.

4. TPP(x,z): Impossible. If x touches z's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), then y would touch x's boundary at that point, contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible. If x is completely within z's interior, then y would also be in z's interior, contradicting TPP(y,z) which states y touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be within x and touch x's boundary, while y touches z's boundary at a point inside x's interior.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely within x's interior, with y touching z's boundary but still inside x's interior.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x=z, then TPP(y,z) would mean TPP(y,x), contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
