PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step-by-step. 

We're told that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

We need to find all possible relationships between x and z. The possible relationships come from the RCC-8 calculus, which includes: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Let me think about the possible configurations:

1. x and z are completely disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at one boundary and z touches y at a completely different boundary. For example, imagine three circles where x touches y on the left, and z touches y on the right.

2. x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts, i.e., EC(x,z): This is possible if x and z happen to touch at a point or along a boundary. For example, imagine three circles in a row where x touches y, and y touches z, and x also happens to touch z at a single point.

3. x and z partially overlap, i.e., PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z overlap in some region. For example, imagine x and z as two large circles that both touch y at different points, but also overlap with each other in a region away from y.

4. x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is entirely contained within z, and x touches the boundary of z. I think this is possible. Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of z, and x as an even smaller circle that is inside z and touches y and also touches the boundary of z.

5. x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is entirely contained within the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems possible. Imagine z as a large circle, y as a circle that crosses the boundary of z (so part of y is inside z and part is outside), and x as a small circle entirely inside z that touches y but is away from z's boundary.

6. z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This would mean that z is entirely contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x. This is the reverse of case 4 and is possible. Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x, and z as an even smaller circle that is inside x and touches y and also touches the boundary of x.

7. z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This would mean that z is entirely contained within the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is the reverse of case 5 and is possible. Imagine x as a large circle, y as a circle that crosses the boundary of x (so part of y is inside x and part is outside), and z as a small circle entirely inside x that touches y but is away from x's boundary.

8. x and z are coincident, i.e., EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are the same region. This is not possible because if x and z are the same, and both externally connect to y, then y would have to externally connect to itself, which doesn't make sense in the context of these spatial relations.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi. The only relationship that doesn't seem possible is EQ.

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for some of these.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. But we know EC(x,y), which means x touches y at a boundary. If x is a proper part of z, and x touches y, then z must also touch y, which is consistent with EC(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary. We know EC(x,y), so x touches y at a boundary. If x is a proper part of z, and x touches y, then z must also touch or overlap with y. Since we're given EC(y,z), z touches y, which is consistent with NTPP(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)), z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. We know EC(y,z), so z touches y at a boundary. If z is a proper part of x, and z touches y, then x must also touch or overlap with y. Since we're given EC(x,y), x touches y, which is consistent with TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)), z is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. We know EC(y,z), so z touches y at a boundary. If z is a proper part of x, and z touches y, then x must either touch or overlap with y. Since we're given EC(x,y), x touches y, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be a bit more careful with the "tangential proper part" relations. Let's think more deeply:

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. If x touches y (EC(x,y)), then either x touches y at a point on x's boundary that is also on z's boundary, or x touches y at a point on x's boundary that is in the interior of z. 

In the first case, z would also touch y at that same point, which is consistent with EC(y,z). 

In the second case, since the point where x touches y is in the interior of z, z would overlap with y rather than just touching it, which would contradict EC(y,z).

So, for TPP(x,z) to be valid, the point where x touches y must also be on the boundary of z. Let's think if this is geometrically possible in 2D space: If x is a tangential proper part of z, and x touches y at a point p, then p is on the boundary of x and on the boundary of y. For TPP(x,z), p must also be on the boundary of z. But if p is on the boundary of both x and z, and x is a proper part of z, then p must be a point where the boundaries of x and z coincide. This means that at point p, the boundary of z is also the boundary of x. Now, if y touches x at p and y touches z at p, then y would touch both x and z at the same point p. This seems geometrically possible, especially in configurations where the boundaries of x and z are tangential at p, and y touches both at that tangent point.

So, TPP(x,z) seems possible.

Similar reasoning applies to TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)), and it also seems possible.

Now, let's check NTPP(x,z). If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means x is entirely within the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If x touches y (EC(x,y)), then y touches the interior of z, which would mean that z and y overlap, not just touch. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)), if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and z touches y (EC(y,z)), then y touches the interior of x, which would mean that x and y overlap, not just touch. This contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Let me reconsider the EQ relationship. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and x and z are the same, then y would externally connect to the same region twice, which doesn't make sense in the context of binary relations between distinct regions.

So, after a more careful analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

Actually, wait. Let me think more clearly about the NTPP and NTPPi cases.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary. We know EC(x,y), so x touches y at a boundary. If x touches y, and x is entirely within z, then z must at least touch y (if not overlap with it). Given that EC(y,z), z and y touch at a boundary, which is consistent. So, NTPP(x,z) could be possible.

But let's think more precisely: If x is a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y at a boundary, then the boundary point where x touches y must be in the interior of z. This would mean z and y share an interior point, which would make them overlap, not just touch. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)), if z is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches y at a boundary, then the boundary point where z touches y must be in the interior of x. This would mean x and y share an interior point, which would make them overlap, not just touch. This contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's recheck the TPP and TPPi relationships.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. If x touches y (EC(x,y)), then either x touches y at a point on x's boundary that is also on z's boundary, or x touches y at a point on x's boundary that is in the interior of z.

The second case, as I discussed earlier, is not valid because it would mean z and y overlap.

The first case is when the point where x touches y is also on the boundary of z. In this case, z would also touch y at that same point, which is consistent with EC(y,z). Is this geometrically possible? I think it is. For example, imagine x as a circle that's tangential to y at a point p. Now, imagine z as a larger circle that contains x, and z is also tangential to y at the same point p. This configuration satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)), the point where z touches y must also be on the boundary of x. This is geometrically possible. Imagine z as a circle that's tangential to y at a point p. Now, imagine x as a larger circle that contains z, and x is also tangential to y at the same point p. This configuration satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Let's also double check the PO relationship.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap. If x touches y at a boundary point p (EC(x,y)), and z touches y at a boundary point q (EC(y,z)), then for x and z to partially overlap, they must share some region. If p and q are the same point, then x and z would both touch y at the same point, which is consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap in this case? I think it is. For example, imagine x and z as two circles that intersect, and y as a circle that touches both x and z at the intersection point. This configuration satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

If p and q are different points, then x and z would touch y at different points. In this case, for x and z to partially overlap, they must share a region away from y. This is also possible. For example, imagine x and z as two circles that intersect, and y as a circle that touches x at one point and touches z at another point. This configuration satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

Actually, wait, I made an error in my reasoning about TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z). Let me re-evaluate these cases.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at a boundary point. For z, we know EC(y,z), so z touches y at a boundary point. If x is a proper part of z, and x touches y, and z touches y, then the boundary point of x that touches y must also be a boundary point of z. 

Let's imagine z as a solid disk and x as a smaller solid disk inside z, such that the boundary of x touches the boundary of z at a single point p. Now, if y is another solid disk that touches both x and z at the point p, this configuration satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)), z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. Given that EC(y,z), z touches y at a boundary point. For x, we know EC(x,y), so x touches y at a boundary point. If z is a proper part of x, and z touches y, and x touches y, then the boundary point of z that touches y must also be a boundary point of x.

Let's imagine x as a solid disk and z as a smaller solid disk inside x, such that the boundary of z touches the boundary of x at a single point p. Now, if y is another solid disk that touches both x and z at the point p, this configuration satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

But wait, I should verify these relationships by considering the transitivity table for RCC-8 relations. Let's refer to a standard transitivity table for RCC-8 to check the possible compositions of EC with EC.

According to the RCC-8 transitivity table, when we compose EC with EC, the result can be: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi, and EQ. This means that when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z include all the RCC-8 relations.

However, this transitivity table gives a general composition, which may not be tight. Let me think more carefully about the specific constraints of the situation.

For NTPP(x,z), we've already established that if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x touches y at a boundary point, then y would overlap with z, not just touch it. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), we've already established that if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and z touches y at a boundary point, then y would overlap with x, not just touch it. This contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, and both touch y, then y would touch the same region twice, which doesn't make sense in the context of binary relations between distinct regions. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Given these more detailed considerations, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

Actually, I'd like to double check my reasoning once more, especially for the NTPP and NTPPi cases. Let me think about the NTPP case (the NTPPi case follows by symmetry).

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary. We know EC(x,y), so x touches y at a boundary point. If x touches y, and x is entirely within the interior of z, then the boundary point of x that touches y would be in the interior of z. This would mean y overlaps with z, not just touches it. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's also double check the TPP and TPPi cases using a different approach.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at a boundary point. For z, we know EC(y,z), so z touches y at a boundary point. 

If x and z touch y at the same boundary point, then the boundary of x and the boundary of z must coincide at that point. This is geometrically possible: imagine x as a circle inside a larger circle z, where they are tangent at a point p, and y is another circle that touches both x and z at p.

If x and z touch y at different boundary points, then for TPP(x,z) to hold, x must still be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. But if x touches y at a point that's not on the boundary of z, then that point would be in the interior of z, which would mean y overlaps with z, not just touches it. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, in this case, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, for TPP(x,z) to be possible, x and z must touch y at the same boundary point.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), z and x must touch y at the same boundary point.

Now, let me reconsider the PO relationship.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap. If x touches y at a boundary point p (EC(x,y)), and z touches y at a boundary point q (EC(y,z)), then for PO(x,z) to hold, x and z must share some region while neither being a part of the other.

If p and q are the same point, then x and z would both touch y at the same point. Is it geometrically possible for x and z to partially overlap in this case? Let's think about it. If x and z are both touching y at the same point, then the boundaries of x and z must both pass through that point. For x and z to partially overlap, they must share an interior region. 

Imagine x and z as two circles that intersect, and y as a circle that touches both x and z at one of the two intersection points. This configuration satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

If p and q are different points, then x and z would touch y at different points. For x and z to partially overlap, they must share an interior region. This is geometrically possible. Imagine x and z as two circles that intersect, and y as a circle that touches x at one point and touches z at another point. This configuration satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In conclusion, after a careful analysis, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

Actually, I'm not yet satisfied about NTPP and NTPPi. Let's visualize a scenario for NTPP(x,z) and see if it's consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z):

Imagine z as a large circle, and x as a smaller circle completely inside z but not touching z's boundary. Now, let y be a shape that has a thin projection that reaches into z to touch x, and the rest of y is outside z, touching z's boundary at a different point. In this configuration, EC(x,y) because x touches y only at a boundary, and EC(y,z) because y touches z only at a boundary. But x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

Is the above scenario valid? Let's consider: For EC(x,y), x and y share a boundary point but no interior. For EC(y,z), y and z share a boundary point but no interior. In the described scenario, y has a thin projection that reaches into z, which means y and z share an interior part, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

By symmetry, NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

I think I'm now confident that the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

Actually, hang on, I think I'm still making some error in my reasoning because this still contradicts the transitivity table for RCC-8, which says that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) can lead to all eight relations for x and z. Let me re-examine each relation more carefully.

For DC(x,z), x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x touches y on one side and z touches y on the other side, with no direct connection between x and z.

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior. This is possible if x, y, and z are arranged in a way that x and z touch at a point or along a boundary.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share an interior region but neither is a subset of the other.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), both x and z must touch y at the same boundary point of y. This is geometrically possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), x must touch y at a boundary point that's in the interior of z, and z must touch y at a different boundary point. But if x touches y at a point in the interior of z, then that point is shared by both y and z, which would make them overlap, not just touch. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), both x and z must touch y at the same boundary point of y. This is geometrically possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), z must touch y at a boundary point that's in the interior of x, and x must touch y at a different boundary point. But if z touches y at a point in the interior of x, then that point is shared by both y and x, which would make them overlap, not just touch. This contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and x and z are the same, then y would externally connect to the same region twice, which doesn't make sense in the context of binary relations between distinct regions. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after this detailed analysis, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

Actually, I think my misunderstandings may arise from conflating the model-theoretic (or set-theoretic) relationships with the topological ones. For a more precise treatment, I should respect that EC is a topological relation. A crucial property in these models is connectedness, or the notion that a region can't be split into disconnected parts.

Let me review each relation once more, focusing on a topological interpretation. I'm going to consider both 1D and 2D examples, since certain configurations might be easier to imagine in different dimensions.

DC(x,z): Disconnected.
- 1D Example: Imagine a line with three intervals: x is from 0 to 1, y is from 1 to 2, and z is from 2 to 3. Here, EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and x and z are disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z).
- 2D Example: Imagine three circles where x touches y on the left, and z touches y on the right. Here, x and z are disconnected.

EC(x,z): Externally connected.
- 1D Example: Imagine a line with three intervals: x is from 0 to 1, y is from 1 to 3, and z is from 3 to 4. Here, EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and x and z are not directly connected. This means EC(x,z) is not possible in 1D.
- 2D Example: Imagine three circles in a triangle configuration, where each pair of circles touches at a boundary. Here, EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and also EC(x,z).

Actually, I realize that the 1D examples are not going to be helpful because we can't have three intervals on a line where each pair of intervals touches but don't overlap. So I'll focus on 2D.

PO(x,z): Partially overlapping.
- 2D Example: Imagine three circles where each pair of circles partially overlaps. Here, EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) can't be satisfied, because if x and y partially overlap, they share an interior, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, there's an issue here. The RCC-8 relations define EC(a,b) as a and b touching at a boundary but not sharing any interior parts. This means a and b must touch at a boundary point, not overlap.

I think I've been careless in my interpretation. Let me revisit the definitions and think more precisely.

EC(a,b) means that the closures of a and b intersect, but their interiors don't. This is the precise mathematical definition in terms of point-set topology.

With this in mind, let's reconsider the possible relationships:

DC(x,z): Disconnected. This means the closures of x and z don't intersect. This is possible if x touches y on one side and z touches y on the other side, with no direct connection between x and z.

EC(x,z): Externally connected. This means the closures of x and z intersect, but their interiors don't. This is possible if x, y, and z are arranged in a way that the boundary of x touches the boundary of z.

PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. This means the interiors of x and z intersect, but neither is a subset of the other. At first, it seems challenging to arrange x, y, and z such that EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z) all hold. However, I think it's possible. Imagine x and z as two large circles that partially overlap, and y as a shape that touches both x and z at their boundaries but doesn't overlap with either. This would satisfy all three relations.

TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part. This means x is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. Let's think if this is consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). If x is inside z and touches z's boundary at a point p, and y touches both x and z at that same point p, then EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z) are all satisfied.

NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part. This means x is a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y touches x at a point q, then y would overlap with z (because q would be in the interior of z), which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Inverse tangential proper part. This means z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary at a point p, and y touches both x and z at that same point p, then EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z) are all satisfied.

NTPPi(x,z): Inverse non-tangential proper part. This means z is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z at a point q, then y would overlap with x (because q would be in the interior of x), which contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): Equal. This means x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and x and z are the same, then y would externally connect to the same region twice, which doesn't make sense in the context of binary relations between distinct regions. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider my reasoning for PO, as I'm not convinced this is possible.

For PO(x,z), the interiors of x and z must intersect, but neither is a subset of the other. We also need EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), which means y touches both x and z at boundary points, but doesn't share interiors with either.

For x and z to partially overlap, they must share an interior region. If y touches x at a boundary point, this point must be on the boundary of x. Similarly, if y touches z at a boundary point, this point must be on the boundary of z.

Now, if x and z partially overlap, they share an interior region. But y needs to touch both x and z at boundary points without overlapping with either. This means y needs to touch x at a point on x's boundary that's not in the interior of z, and y needs to touch z at a point on z's boundary that's not in the interior of x.

Is this geometrically possible? Imagine x and z as two circles that partially overlap. The boundary of x consists of points that are in the interior of z (where x and z overlap), points that are outside z, and possibly points that are on the boundary of z (where the boundaries of x and z intersect). Similarly for the boundary of z.

For y to touch x and z while satisfying EC, y needs to touch x at a point on x's boundary that's not in the interior of z, and y needs to touch z at a point on z's boundary that's not in the interior of x.

This seems geometrically possible. For example, imagine x and z as two circles that partially overlap, and y as a shape that touches x at a point on x's boundary that's outside z, and touches z at a point on z's boundary that's outside x.

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

Actually, my reasoning for the above has been a bit inconsistent. Let me think more precisely.

For EC(x,y), the closures of x and y intersect, but their interiors don't. The closure of a set is the set itself plus its boundary, so EC means the boundaries of the sets intersect but the interiors don't.

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), let's examine the possible relationships between x and z:

DC(x,z): The closures of x and z don't intersect. This means x and z are completely separated. This is possible if x touches y on one side and z touches y on the other side, with no direct connection between x and z.

EC(x,z): The boundaries of x and z intersect, but their interiors don't. This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary point or along a boundary segment.

PO(x,z): The interiors of x and z intersect, but neither is a subset of the other. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), we need to ensure that y touches both x and z at boundary points, but doesn't overlap with either.

Let me visualize a configuration in a 2D Euclidean space:
- Let x be the interior and boundary of a unit disk centered at the origin: x = {(a, b) | a^2 + b^2 <= 1}.
- Let z be the interior and boundary of a unit disk centered at (1, 0): z = {(a, b) | (a-1)^2 + b^2 <= 1}.
- Note that x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z).
- Let y be the interior and boundary of a thin crescent-shaped region that touches x at (0, 1) and touches z at (1, 1).

In this configuration, x and z partially overlap (their interiors intersect, but neither is a subset of the other), y touches both x and z at boundary points, but y doesn't overlap with either x or z. So, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z) are all satisfied.

So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

TPP(x,z): The interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, and the boundary of x intersects the boundary of z. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch both x and z at boundary points. 

Consider this configuration:
- Let z be the interior and boundary of a unit disk centered at the origin: z = {(a, b) | a^2 + b^2 <= 1}.
- Let x be the interior and boundary of a disk with radius 0.5, centered at (0.5, 0): x = {(a, b) | (a-0.5)^2 + b^2 <= 0.25}.
- Note that x is a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z).
- Let y be the interior and boundary of a disk that touches both x and z at the point (1, 0).

In this configuration, x is a tangential proper part of z, y touches both x and z at the same boundary point, but y doesn't overlap with either x or z. So, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z) are all satisfied.

So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

NTPP(x,z): The interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, and the boundary of x doesn't intersect the boundary of z. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch x at a boundary point, and y must touch z at a boundary point.

But if the boundary of x doesn't intersect the boundary of z (due to NTPP), then the point where y touches x is in the interior of z. This means y and z would overlap, not just touch, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): The interior of z is a subset of the interior of x, and the boundary of z intersects the boundary of x. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch both x and z at boundary points.

Consider this configuration:
- Let x be the interior and boundary of a unit disk centered at the origin: x = {(a, b) | a^2 + b^2 <= 1}.
- Let z be the interior and boundary of a disk with radius 0.5, centered at (0.5, 0): z = {(a, b) | (a-0.5)^2 + b^2 <= 0.25}.
- Note that z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z).
- Let y be the interior and boundary of a disk that touches both x and z at the point (1, 0).

In this configuration, z is a tangential proper part of x, y touches both x and z at the same boundary point, but y doesn't overlap with either x or z. So, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z) are all satisfied.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

NTPPi(x,z): The interior of z is a subset of the interior of x, and the boundary of z doesn't intersect the boundary of x. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch z at a boundary point, and y must touch x at a boundary point.

But if the boundary of z doesn't intersect the boundary of x (due to NTPPi), then the point where y touches z is in the interior of x. This means y and x would overlap, not just touch, which contradicts EC(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): The regions x and z are identical. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and x and z are the same, then y would externally connect to the same region twice, which doesn't make sense in the context of binary relations between distinct regions. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In conclusion, after a comprehensive analysis, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

Actually, wait a moment. Let me re-examine the NTPP case, because I've been making a conceptual error.

For NTPP(x,z), the interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z, and the boundary of x doesn't intersect the boundary of z. This means x is completely contained in the interior of z.

Now, if EC(x,y), then y touches x at a boundary point. This boundary point of x is in the interior of z (because the boundary of x is in the interior of z for NTPP). So, y shares a point with the interior of z, which means y and z overlap, not just touch. This contradicts EC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), the interior of z is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the boundary of z doesn't intersect the boundary of x. This means z is completely contained in the interior of x.

Now, if EC(y,z), then y touches z at a boundary point. This boundary point of z is in the interior of x (because the boundary of z is in the interior of x for NTPPi). So, y shares a point with the interior of x, which means y and x overlap, not just touch. This contradicts EC(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y touches the same region (x or z) at a boundary point. This is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Wait, I just contradicted myself. Let me be more precise. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and EQ(x,z), then y touches x at a boundary point and y touches z at a boundary point. But x and z are the same region, so y touches the same region at boundary points. This is conceptually sound.

But if x and z are identical, and they both externally connect to y, doesn't this imply that y externally connects to the same region twice?

Actually, in the context of the RCC-8 relations, we're considering binary relations between regions. If x and z are the same region, then the relations EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are the same. It doesn't mean y connects to the same region twice; it means the same relation is stated twice. So, EQ(x,z) is a valid possibility.

But wait, I'm overthinking this. If x and z are the same region, then the relations EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are the same. This is trivially satisfiable: imagine x and z are identical circles, and y is a circle that touches x/z at a boundary point. So, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and EQ(x,z) are all satisfied.

So, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait again. I initially ruled out NTPP and NTPPi, but I need to reconsider the constraints. The reason I ruled them out was that if EC(x,y), and NTPP(x,z), then y would overlap with z, which contradicts EC(y,z). Similarly, if EC(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)), then y would overlap with x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

But this reasoning assumes a standard topological model where regions are regular closed sets and the EC relation means the boundaries intersect but the interiors don't. Is this the correct interpretation for the RCC-8 calculus?

The RCC-8 calculus is based on the Region Connection Calculus, where regions are non-empty, regular closed sets, and the C relation is reflexive and symmetric. In the RCC-8 calculus, EC(a,b) means C(a,b) and ¬O(a,b), where C is the connection relation and O is the overlap relation.

Given this, if EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and NTPP(x,z), then x is completely contained in the interior of z. If y touches x at a boundary point, this boundary point is in the interior of z. But if a boundary point of y is in the interior of z, then y and z would overlap, not just touch, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible, and by symmetry, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let's check the EQ relation again. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y touches the same region (x or z) at a boundary point. This is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

But, if EQ(x,z), then saying EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) is redundant, as they express the same constraint. This suggests that we're treating x and z as distinct regions in the problem statement. If we're supposed to treat them as distinct, then EQ(x,z) would not be a valid answer to the question. But from a purely mathematical standpoint, EQ(x,z) doesn't introduce any inconsistency with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Given the standard interpretation of the RCC-8 calculus, and the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and possibly EQ.

Let me double-check my reasoning once more. According to the problem, the RCC-8 relations are "pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive binary spatial relations." This means that for any two regions, exactly one of the eight relations holds. Given this, the EQ relation should be treated on the same footing as the other relations.

If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y touches both x and z at boundary points, but doesn't overlap with either. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region, which means y touches the same region twice, which is consistent.

In fact, given the standard transitivity table for RCC-8, when we compose EC with EC, the result includes all eight relations. However, that's a general result. In the specific context of our problem, NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible for the reasons I've already explained.

So, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

But I made a conceptual error in my earlier analysis. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y touches the same region (x or z) at boundary points. The key question is: can y touch the same region at multiple boundary points? Yes, it can. There's nothing in the RCC-8 calculus that prevents a region from touching another region at multiple boundary points.

So, EQ(x,z) is a valid possibility.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I've been overthinking this. Let's take a step back and consider a more concrete example.

If we have three regions x, y, and z where EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x touches y on one side and z touches y on the other side, with no direct connection between x and z.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary point but share no interior. This is possible if x, y, and z are arranged such that x and z also touch at a boundary point.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some interior but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible if x and z overlap in a region, and y touches both at boundary points outside the overlap.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z, touches z's boundary at a point, and y touches both x and z at that same point.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If y touches x at a boundary point, and x is completely inside the interior of z, then y would overlap with z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of TPP(x,z) and is possible by the same reasoning.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of NTPP(x,z) and is not possible by the same reasoning.

EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and x and z are the same, then y touches the same region at boundary points. This is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

But wait, let me reconsider EQ more carefully. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y touches both x and z at boundary points. But if x and z are the same, then the relations EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are identical. This means they express the same constraint: y touches the region (x or z) at a boundary point. There's no requirement or contradiction that y touches the region at multiple boundary points.

So, EQ(x,z) is a valid possibility.

After all these detailed considerations, I believe the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

But before concluding, let me rethink the NTPP and NTPPi scenarios once more, as they're the least clear to me.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside the interior of z. Given EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary point. Since x is inside the interior of z, this boundary point of x is in the interior of z. This means y and z share a point in the interior of z, which implies they overlap, contradicting EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside the interior of x. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at a boundary point. Since z is inside the interior of x, this boundary point of z is in the interior of x. This means y and x share a point in the interior of x, which implies they overlap, contradicting EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y touches both x and z at boundary points. But if x and z are the same, then the relations EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) express the same constraint: y touches the region (x or z) at a boundary point. This is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I just realized there's a mistake in my reasoning about EQ. The problem states that the RCC-8 relations are "pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive binary spatial relations." If we're considering x and z as distinct regions, then they're related by one of the eight RCC-8 relations. But if EQ(x,z), then x and z are not distinct regions; they are the same region.

Given that the problem is asking for the relationship between x and z, it's implied that x and z are distinct regions. So, EQ(x,z) would not be a valid answer.

But on further reflection, I don't think this is the correct interpretation. The fact that x and z are denoted by different variables doesn't necessarily mean they are distinct regions. The problem asks for the possible relationships between x and z, and EQ is one of the possible RCC-8 relations. So, EQ(x,z) should be considered as a valid possibility.

Let me focus on the core of the problem: given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

EC(a,b) means the closures of a and b intersect, but their interiors don't. In point-set topology, this means a and b share boundary points but no interior points.

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), x and y share boundary points but no interior points, and y and z share boundary points but no interior points.

For DC(x,z), x and z are disconnected, which is possible if x and z are separated by y or are otherwise not connected.

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior, which is possible if x and z are arranged to touch at a boundary.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap, sharing an interior region but neither is a subset of the other, which is possible if x and z are arranged to overlap in this way.

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary, which is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches both x and z at that point.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary. If x is inside the interior of z, and y touches x at a boundary point, then y would share a point with the interior of z, which means y and z would overlap, contradicting EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary, which is possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches both x and z at that point.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary. If z is inside the interior of x, and y touches z at a boundary point, then y would share a point with the interior of x, which means y and x would overlap, contradicting EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y touches the region (x or z) at a boundary point. This is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait, let me challenge my own reasoning about PO(x,z) once more. For PO(x,z), the interiors of x and z must intersect, and neither is a subset of the other. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y touches both x and z at boundary points, but shares no interior with either.

Imagine two circles x and z that partially overlap, and a third circle y that touches both x and z at boundary points outside the overlap region. In this configuration, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z) are all satisfied.

Is this geometrically possible? Yes. For example, imagine x as a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1, and z as a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 1. The two circles overlap in a region. Now, imagine y as a circle centered at (1.5, 0) with radius 0.5. The circle y touches z at the point (2,0), which is on the boundary of both y and z. Additionally, y might touch x at some point on its boundary, although this might require adjusting the radius or position of y.

Regardless, it's geometrically possible to have PO(x,z) along with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

I think I've been overthinking this problem. Let's simplify and refer to the standard transitivity table for RCC-8. According to this table, when we compose EC with EC, the possible resulting relations include all eight RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

However, in the specific context of our problem, we've established that NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible based on the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I made an error in reasoning. I was thinking of the general composition of EC with EC, which can result in any relation. But we're not doing a general composition; we have specific regions x, y, and z where EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, I think this is actually a case where the composition table gives weak composition or not tight composition for this specific pair of relations. So we need to narrow it down.

Given the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

We've already verified that NTPP and NTPPi are not possible in this context.

So, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait. Let's get really clear here, and draw pictures for the different scenarios we've been considering.

First, EC(x,y) means that the regions x and y touch at their boundaries, but don't overlap. Their closures intersect, but their interiors don't. Similarly, EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries, but don't overlap.

Now, let's start by examining a case where we have DC(x,z) (x and z are disconnected).
Imagine a line with y in the middle, x touching y on the left, and z touching y on the right. Here, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z). This is a valid arrangement that satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and DC(x,z).

Next, let's examine a case where we have EC(x,z) (x and z touch at a boundary, but don't overlap).
Imagine three circles in a triangle arrangement, where each pair of circles touches at a boundary. This arrangement satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z).

For PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap), imagine two large circles x and z that partially overlap, and a smaller circle y that touches both x and z at boundaries but doesn't overlap with either. This arrangement satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

For TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z), imagine a large circle z, a smaller circle x inside z that touches z's boundary at a point, and a circle y that touches both x and z at that same point. This arrangement satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z), imagine a large circle z, a smaller circle x completely inside z and not touching z's boundary, and a circle y. The constraint is that y touches both x and z at boundary points, but doesn't overlap with either. If y touches x at a boundary point, then this boundary point is in the interior of z. But if a boundary point of y is in the interior of z, then y and z would overlap, not just touch, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x), the reasoning is analogous to the TPP case, just with the roles of x and z interchanged. This arrangement satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x), the reasoning is analogous to the NTPP case, just with the roles of x and z interchanged. By similar logic, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) (x and z are the same region), if x and z are the same, then the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) mean the same thing: y touches the region (x or z) at a boundary point. This is consistent. Imagine a circle x/z and another circle y that touches x/z at a boundary point. This arrangement satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and EQ(x,z).

In conclusion, based on my detailed analysis, the possible relationships between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

I'm now fully convinced of this answer.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let me recall what EC means: x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Possible. Imagine x touching y on one side and z touching y on another side, with no connection between x and z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Possible. Imagine x, y, and z arranged in a triangle, each touching the others at boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Possible. Imagine x and z overlapping in a region, with y touching both at boundaries outside the overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Possible. Imagine x inside z, touching z's boundary at a point, with y touching both x and z at that same point.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x at a boundary point, then y would have to intersect z's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Possible. Imagine z inside x, touching x's boundary at a point, with y touching both at that same point.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Not possible. By similar reasoning to NTPP case.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Possible. If x and z are identical, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are the same constraint.
