PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.

2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are equal (coincident). They occupy exactly the same space.

3. Now we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), they are the same region. That means anything that holds for y also holds for z. 

Given that x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), and y equals z, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this reasoning. 

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely inside y
- x does not touch y's boundary

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z are exactly the same region
- They have the same interior
- They have the same boundary

If y and z are exactly the same region, then:
- The interior of y is the interior of z
- The boundary of y is the boundary of z

Since x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y - x is completely contained within y without touching y's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space with identical boundaries and interiors.

Since y and z are exactly the same region (EQ(y,z)), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. 

Therefore, if x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is identical to z, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
