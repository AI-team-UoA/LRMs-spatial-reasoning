PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a proper part of x and y does not touch the boundary of x. In other words, y is completely contained in the interior of x.
- EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are coincident (identical in terms of spatial extent).

Now, I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between y and any other region also holds between z and that region.

Given that NTPPi(x,y), which means y is completely contained in the interior of x, and since z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), it follows that z is also completely contained in the interior of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is also NTPP inverse, i.e., NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is:
NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let's double-check this. 

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely contained in the interior of x).

EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical.

If y is completely contained in the interior of x, and z is identical to y, then z is also completely contained in the interior of x.

Therefore, NTPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is:
NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given the conditions NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

First, let's understand what these conditions mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely contained in the interior of x without touching x's boundary)
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are spatially identical (they occupy exactly the same region)

Since z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, it follows that z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, NTPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).
