PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to consider what relations between regions x and z are consistent with the given constraints: EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's analyze the scenario:
- EC(x,y): Regions x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- PO(y,z): Regions y and z partially overlap - they share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other

Now, I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z given these constraints.

Let me go through each of the 8 RCC-8 relations and check if it's possible for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   This is definitely possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, x could still be completely separate from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
   This is possible. x could touch y at a boundary point, and z could also reach that same boundary point without x and z sharing any interior.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is possible. Even though x only touches y at the boundary, z extends into y, so z could overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This seems unlikely because x only touches y at the boundary, so x shouldn't be able to be completely contained in z. But let me think more carefully... Actually, it could be possible if z extends far beyond y and completely encompasses x except where x touches y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is impossible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x cannot be externally connected (EC) to y because y and z share some parts.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   Similar to TPP, this seems possible if x is much larger than y and completely contains z except where z touches x's boundary (which is also where x touches y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This seems impossible because z shares parts with y, and y touches x only at the boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   This is impossible because x only touches y at the boundary, while z shares interior points with y.

Let me verify these intuitions by thinking about specific spatial configurations:

For DC(x,z): Imagine y as a mediating region between completely separate regions x and z.
For EC(x,z): Imagine x and z both touching y at the same boundary point.
For PO(x,z): Imagine z extending beyond y into x's territory.
For TPP(x,z): Imagine z being a large region that contains x except where x touches y's boundary.
For TPPi(x,z): Imagine x being a large region that contains z except where z touches x's boundary.

Wait, I need to be more systematic. Let me reconsider the constraints:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap - they share some interior points.

Let's carefully consider each relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x touches only y's boundary, while z overlaps with some internal part of y. x and z can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and z could touch at a boundary point where x also touches y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. Since z overlaps with y, and x touches y's boundary, z could extend beyond y to overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): Is this possible? If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, I need to determine if x can be completely inside z.

Let me think... If z encompasses a large area including all of x except where x touches y's boundary, and that boundary point of y is also on z's boundary, then x could be a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is this possible? If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But we know x touches y's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then the boundary point where x touches y must be inside z. But that would mean that boundary point of y is inside z, which contradicts the notion of partial overlap (as boundaries should be at the interface). So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is this possible? If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x but touches x's boundary. Given that z partially overlaps with y, and x touches y's boundary, I need to determine if z can be completely inside x.

Let me think... If x is a large region that includes all of z, and z touches x's boundary at the same point where x touches y's boundary, then z could be a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is this possible? If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x's boundary. This seems contradictory. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z overlaps with y, then y must extend inside x beyond z. But then y would have parts inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is this possible? If x and z are equal, then they occupy exactly the same space. But x touches y's boundary, while z partially overlaps with y. These are contradictory conditions. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

After this systematic analysis, I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x

Wait, let me double-check TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z). These seem the most dubious.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained in z but touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), this means that x touches y's boundary at a point that is also on z's boundary. Since y and z partially overlap, they share some interior points, and their boundaries intersect. It's possible for x to be inside z and touch z's boundary exactly where y also touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x but touch x's boundary. Given PO(y,z), z shares interior points with y. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y's boundary. For z to be completely inside x, the part of y that overlaps with z must also be inside x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says x and y don't share interior points. So TPPi(x,z) is actually impossible.

Let me reconsider TPPi(x,z) carefully. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x but touch x's boundary. Given PO(y,z), z shares interior points with y. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y's boundary.

Actually, I think my reasoning about TPPi was incorrect. Let's think about it differently. If z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary, and z partially overlaps with y, then the part of y that overlaps with z must be inside x. But EC(x,y) means x and y don't share interior points. This is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z

Actually, wait a minute. I need to be extremely careful about TPP(x,z). For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained in z but touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior points with y. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points.

If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then the point where x touches y's boundary must also be on z's boundary. This is possible in a scenario where z encompasses x, and both x and z touch y's boundary at the same point. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

So, after careful reconsideration, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z

Actually, I realize I could be overthinking this. Let me try to visualize clear examples of each possible relation to be sure:

DC(x,z): Imagine three regions where x touches y on the left, z overlaps with y on the right, and there's no direct contact between x and z.

EC(x,z): Imagine x and z both touching y at the same boundary point, with z also overlapping with part of y.

PO(x,z): Imagine z extending from its overlap with y into territory that is also occupied by x, creating a partial overlap between x and z.

TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large region that contains all of x except at one point where x touches y's boundary, which is also on z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z): This doesn't seem possible because x touches y's boundary, so it can't be completely inside z without touching z's boundary if z and y overlap.

TPPi(x,z): This doesn't seem possible because if z is completely inside x, then the part of y that overlaps with z would also be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this is impossible because it would require y to have parts inside x.

EQ(x,z): This is impossible because x touches y's boundary while z overlaps with y.

So, based on this visualization approach, I confirm that the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)

Let me double-check the TPP case one more time, as it's the trickiest:

For TPP(x,z), x is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior.

For x to be completely inside z while touching y at the boundary, the point where x touches y must also be on z's boundary. This is geometrically possible: imagine z as a large region containing x, with both x and z touching y's boundary at the same point.

Actually, now I have a doubt about TPP(x,z). For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z but touch z's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z (due to PO(y,z)), I need to confirm that the boundary point where x touches y can also be on z's boundary.

In the case of partial overlap (PO(y,z)), y and z share interior points, and their boundaries intersect. The boundary of y consists of points that are inside z, points that are outside z, and points that are on z's boundary. If x touches y at a point that is on z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is possible. If x touches y at a point that is outside z, then DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) or PO(x,z) is possible.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible if x touches y at a boundary point that is also on z's boundary.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z

But let me also consider if there are any specific requirements for TPP(x,z). 

For TPP(x,z), x must be a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be completely inside z while touching y's boundary, the point where x touches y must be on z's boundary.

In the case of PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points. The boundary of y consists of points that are inside z, points that are outside z, and points that are on z's boundary. For TPP(x,z) to be possible, x must touch y at a boundary point that is also on z's boundary.

If x touches y at a point that is outside z, then x cannot be completely inside z, so TPP(x,z) is not possible in that case. If x touches y at a point that is inside z, then x would touch y at a point that is in z's interior, which contradicts the requirement that x touches z's boundary for TPP(x,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is only possible if x touches y at a boundary point that is also on z's boundary. Given PO(y,z), such points exist where the boundaries of y and z intersect.

Therefore, I still believe the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between regions x and z given that EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some interior points)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible: x can touch y's boundary while z overlaps with a different part of y, keeping x and z completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible: x and z can touch at a boundary point (possibly at the same point where x touches y).

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: z can overlap with part of y and also extend to overlap with part of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible: x can be completely contained in z but touch z's boundary at the same point where x touches y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Impossible: If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, it couldn't simultaneously touch y's boundary when y and z only partially overlap.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Impossible: If z is contained in x, the part of y that overlaps with z would also have to be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Impossible: For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Impossible: x only touches y's boundary while z shares interior points with y.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z)
