PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully step by step. We're trying to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z, given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary)

Let's first visualize what these conditions mean:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x, and y touches x's boundary at some point.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary at all.

Given these two conditions, let's determine what we know about x and z:
- y is inside x, touching x's boundary
- z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary

So z is completely inside y, which is inside x. This means z is definitely inside x. But we need to determine whether z touches x's boundary or not.

Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y only touches x's boundary at some points, there's no way for z to touch x's boundary. Therefore, z must be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this reasoning. It's possible I'm missing something.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, z must be inside x (by transitivity of the "inside" relation). But does z touch x's boundary?

Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y only touches x's boundary at some points, z cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify my logic once more by thinking of this in terms of containment:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that z is completely contained in y (without touching y's boundary).

Since z is completely contained in y, and y is contained in x, z must be completely contained in x. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary and y only touches x's boundary at some points, z cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is completely contained in x without touching x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, let me think again. I'm not entirely sure if my reasoning is complete. Let me try to think about this in terms of the formal definitions of these relations.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is contained in x but not equal to x)
2. y touches the boundary of x

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. z is a proper part of y (i.e., z is contained in y but not equal to y)
2. z does not touch the boundary of y

Given these, we can deduce:
1. z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x (by transitivity of the proper part relation).
2. z does not touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x. 

The question is: does z touch the boundary of x?

Actually, I've made a subtle error in my reasoning. Just because y touches x's boundary and z is inside y, we can't immediately conclude whether z touches x's boundary or not. Let me reconsider.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary at some points.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Given these, we know:
1. z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary).
2. y is inside x and touches x's boundary at some points.

Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y might not be "deep" inside x, it's possible that z is still close enough to x's boundary such that it touches it. However, it's also possible that z is so "deep" inside y that it doesn't touch x's boundary.

Let me think about this differently. Imagine a set of concentric circles. The largest circle is x, the middle circle is y, and the innermost circle is z. In this case, y touches the boundary of x, and z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary). In this scenario, z does not touch x's boundary, corresponding to NTPPi(x,z).

But now imagine a different scenario where y is a crescent shape that touches the boundary of x at one end, and z is a circle inside y that's positioned close to where y touches x. In this case, it's theoretically possible for z to also touch x's boundary, which would correspond to TPPi(x,z).

However, upon further reflection, I realize my second scenario isn't possible. If z touches x's boundary, then that point must also be on y's boundary (since y is between x and z). But that contradicts the given condition that z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me check this once more. The constraint is that z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary. Can z touch x's boundary without touching y's boundary?

No, it can't. If z touches x's boundary, then that point of contact must also be on y's boundary (since y is between x and z). But that contradicts the given condition that z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, but I'm still not sure I have fully convinced myself. Let me go more deeply into the definitions of these relations.

First, let's be precise about the definitions of TPP and NTPP:

TPP(a,b) means:
1. Every point in a is also in b (a is a subset of b).
2. There exists a point in b that is not in a (a is a proper subset of b).
3. There exists a point on the boundary of a that is also on the boundary of b (a touches the boundary of b).

NTPP(a,b) means:
1. Every point in a is also in b (a is a subset of b).
2. There exists a point in b that is not in a (a is a proper subset of b).
3. There does not exist a point on the boundary of a that is also on the boundary of b (a does not touch the boundary of b).

Now, let's recall what we're given:
- TPPi(x,y) which is equivalent to TPP(y,x)
- NTPPi(y,z) which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)

From TPP(y,x), we know:
1. y is a subset of x.
2. y is a proper subset of x.
3. y touches the boundary of x.

From NTPP(z,y), we know:
1. z is a subset of y.
2. z is a proper subset of y.
3. z does not touch the boundary of y.

Given these, we can deduce:
1. z is a subset of y, and y is a subset of x, so z is a subset of x (by transitivity of the subset relation).
2. z is a proper subset of y, and y is a proper subset of x, so z is a proper subset of x.
3. z does not touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of x, then there exists a point p that is both on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. This point p must also be in y (since z is a subset of y). But is p on the boundary of y or in the interior of y?

If p is on the boundary of y, then z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts the given condition that z does not touch the boundary of y.

If p is in the interior of y, then p cannot be on the boundary of x (since a point in the interior of y cannot be on the boundary of x, given that y is a subset of x).

Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x, which means the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

I think my reasoning is correct: the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me double-check one more time. I'm trying to be very careful because these spatial reasoning problems can be tricky.

We are given:
- TPPi(x,y) which means TPP(y,x)
- NTPPi(y,z) which means NTPP(z,y)

TPP(y,x) means:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. y touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(z,y) means:
1. z is a proper part of y.
2. z does not touch the boundary of y.

Given these, we know:
1. z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x.
2. z does not touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of x, then there exists a point p that is both on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Since z is a proper part of y, p must also be in y. But is p on the boundary of y or in the interior of y?

If p is on the boundary of y, then z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts the given condition that z does not touch the boundary of y.

If p is in the interior of y, then p cannot be on the boundary of x (since y is a proper part of x, any point in the interior of y must also be in the interior of x, not on the boundary of x).

Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x, which means the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me once more try to clarify this using concrete examples, to be really sure.

Example 1:
x is a large circle.
y is a smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at one point.
z is an even smaller circle inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

In this example, TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) hold. What is the relationship between x and z? z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, so the relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

Example 2:
x is a square.
y is a smaller square inside x, with one corner touching the boundary of x.
z is a circle inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

In this example, TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) hold. What is the relationship between x and z? z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, so the relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

Both examples confirm my reasoning that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But let me challenge my own reasoning once more. Is there a counter-example where the relationship between x and z could be something other than NTPPi(x,z)?

Actually, I realize that I've been conflating the boundary of a region with the region itself. Let me restate what I'm given to make sure I'm being precise:

TPPi(x,y) means:
1. y is a proper part of x (y is a subset of x, but not equal to x).
2. The boundary of y shares at least one point with the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means:
1. z is a proper part of y (z is a subset of y, but not equal to y).
2. The boundary of z does not share any points with the boundary of y.

Alright, I think I've been correctly reasoning in my last few attempts. Let's think once more:

Given that z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, we know that z is a proper part of x.

We need to determine whether the boundary of z shares any points with the boundary of x. If it does, then the relationship is TPPi(x,z), and if it doesn't, then the relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

If the boundary of z shares a point with the boundary of x, then that point must also be on the boundary of y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the given condition that the boundary of z does not share any points with the boundary of y.

Therefore, the boundary of z cannot share any points with the boundary of x, which means the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I believe my reasoning is correct, and the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think of one more concrete example to be sure.

Imagine:
x is a square with side length 3.
y is a square with side length 2, positioned such that one of its corners coincides with a corner of x.
z is a square with side length 1, positioned in the center of y.

In this example, TPPi(x,y) holds because y is a proper part of x and shares a corner with x. NTPPi(y,z) holds because z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

What is the relationship between x and z? z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, so the relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

This example further confirms my reasoning that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

However, I do need to be careful about one thing. If z is positioned at the center of y, does that guarantee that z doesn't touch the boundary of x? It depends on the relative sizes and positions of x, y, and z. If y is very close to the boundary of x in multiple directions, and z is large relative to y, then z might touch the boundary of x.

Let me reconsider more generally. We're given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x.

The question is: is z tangential to x (i.e., does z touch the boundary of x)?

If z touches the boundary of x, then there exists a point p that is both on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Since z is a subset of y, p must also be in y. But is p on the boundary of y or in the interior of y?

If p is on the boundary of y, then the boundary of z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts the given condition NTPPi(y,z) (which states that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning the boundary of z does not touch the boundary of y).

If p is in the interior of y, then p cannot be on the boundary of x. This is because if p is in the interior of y, then there's a small neighborhood around p that's entirely contained in y. Given that y is a proper part of x, this neighborhood must also be entirely contained in x, which means p is in the interior of x, not on the boundary of x.

Actually, wait, that's not necessarily true. Let me rethink.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, I'm trying to determine if z can touch the boundary of x.

Actually, I think this comes down to the definition of TPPi. Let's be more precise.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. The boundary of y shares at least one point with the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means:
1. z is a proper part of y.
2. The boundary of z does not share any points with the boundary of y.

Given these precise definitions, if the boundary of z shares a point with the boundary of x, then that point must also be on the boundary of y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the given condition that the boundary of z does not share any points with the boundary of y.

Therefore, the boundary of z cannot share any points with the boundary of x, which means the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

I believe my reasoning is now correct, and the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized I had a bit of confusion about the precise definitions. Let me reason this through once more, making sure I'm being very precise.

In the RCC-8 qualitative spatial reasoning calculus:
- TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. This means a is a proper part of b, and a touches the boundary of b.
- NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b. This means a is a proper part of b, and a does not touch the boundary of b.
- TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a, which is the same as TPP(b,a).
- NTPPi(a,b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a, which is the same as NTPP(b,a).

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x.

The question is: is z tangential to x (i.e., does z touch the boundary of x)?

If z touches the boundary of x, then there exists a point p that is both on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Since z is a subset of y, p must also be in y. But is p on the boundary of y or in the interior of y?

If p is on the boundary of y, then the boundary of z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts the given condition NTPPi(y,z) (which states that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning the boundary of z does not touch the boundary of y).

But I actually don't think p can be in the interior of y. If p is on the boundary of x, and y is a proper part of x, then p must either be on the boundary of y or outside of y. It can't be in the interior of y because then it would be in the interior of x, not on the boundary of x.

Therefore, the boundary of z cannot share any points with the boundary of x, which means the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. I believe my reasoning is correct, and the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, actually, I'm wondering if this is really the case. Maybe there are other relationships that could hold between x and z given the constraints. Let me review the RCC-8 relations again:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch but don't overlap).
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We know that z is a subset of y, and y is a subset of x, so z is a subset of x. This immediately rules out DC, EC, and PO as possible relationships between x and z.

Since z is a proper subset of y, and y is a proper subset of x, z is a proper subset of x. This rules out EQ as a possible relationship.

So the possible relationships are reduced to TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Given that z is a proper subset of x, it can't be the case that x is a proper subset of z. This rules out TPPi and NTPPi as possible relationships.

So the possible relationships are reduced to TPP and NTPP.

TPP(z,x) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z touches the boundary of x. NTPP(z,x) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z does not touch the boundary of x.

As I've reasoned above, if z touches the boundary of x, then there exists a point p that is both on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Since z is a subset of y, p must also be in y. But p can't be in the interior of y (because then p would be in the interior of x, not on the boundary of x), so p must be on the boundary of y. But if p is on the boundary of y and on the boundary of z, then z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts the given condition NTPPi(y,z).

Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x, which means the relationship is NTPP(z,x), not TPP(z,x).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure I understand the constraints correctly. I believe:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

So y is a proper part of x (but y and x are not identical), and y touches the boundary of x.
And z is a proper part of y (but z and y are not identical), and z does not touch the boundary of y.

We're trying to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, I believe I've been correct in my reasoning (though I took a roundabout way to get there). Let me be precise once more.

1. By definition of NTPPi(y,z), z is a proper part of y (and not equal to y), and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
2. By definition of TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x (and not equal to x), and y touches the boundary of x.

Given that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, we know z is a proper part of x.

The question is: does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of x, then there exists a point p that is both on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Since z is a subset of y, p must also be in y. But is p on the boundary of y or in the interior of y?

If p is on the boundary of y, then the boundary of z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts the given condition NTPPi(y,z) (which states that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning the boundary of z does not touch the boundary of y).

If p is in the interior of y, then p cannot be on the boundary of x. This is because if p is in the interior of y, and y is a subset of x, then p must be in the interior of x (not on the boundary of x). This is because a point in the interior of a set cannot also be on the boundary of a superset of that set. For example, if a point is in the interior of a square, it cannot be on the boundary of a larger square that contains the first square.

Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x, which means the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I realize I'm repeating myself. Let me stop here and conclude.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the only possible relationship, and I've reasoned through it multiple times to confirm.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)

Let me reason through this:

1. From TPPi(x,y), I know that y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

2. From NTPPi(y,z), I know that z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

3. Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z must be inside x (transitivity of containment).

4. Could z touch the boundary of x? If z touches x's boundary, then that point of contact would also have to be on y's boundary (since z is fully contained in y). But this contradicts the fact that z doesn't touch y's boundary.

5. Therefore, z must be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

This means the only possible relationship is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).
