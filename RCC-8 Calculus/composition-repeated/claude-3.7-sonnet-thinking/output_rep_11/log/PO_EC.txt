PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Okay, I'm given two facts:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. This means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
2. EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. This means they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Now I need to determine what are all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z.

Let's think about this systematically. Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't reach y's boundary that touches z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This could happen if the part of x that overlaps with y reaches the boundary of y that touches z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This isn't directly implied by the given facts because y and z don't share interior parts. However, it could be possible in some configurations where x extends beyond y and into z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems unlikely given that y and z only touch at boundaries, and x partially overlaps with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This seems very unlikely for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This could happen if z is small and touches y at a boundary, and x encompasses both y and z, touching z at its boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This seems unlikely because y and z touch at boundaries, meaning z has a boundary point that's also a boundary point of y. If z were completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, it would be hard to reconcile with the fact that z touches y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This seems unlikely because if x and y partially overlap, and y and z are externally connected, it's hard to see how x and z could be the same region.

Let me reason through this more carefully.

Given PO(x,y), we know:
- x and y share some interior points.
- There are parts of x not in y, and parts of y not in x.

Given EC(y,z), we know:
- y and z touch at their boundaries.
- They don't share any interior points.

For DC(x,z) to be possible:
The part of x that overlaps with y doesn't reach the boundary of y that touches z. So x and z don't share any points and are disconnected. This is possible.

For EC(x,z) to be possible:
The part of x that overlaps with y reaches the boundary of y that touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at that boundary point. This is possible.

For PO(x,z) to be possible:
This would require x to overlap with z. Since y and z don't share interior points, for x to overlap with z, it would need to extend beyond y and into z. While this isn't directly implied by the given facts, it's not ruled out either. This is a possibility.

For TPP(x,z) to be possible:
This would mean x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at a boundary, it's hard to see how x could be completely contained within z. However, it's not logically impossible if, for instance, z is a very large region that contains most of y except for a small part that doesn't overlap with x. This is a possible edge case.

For NTPP(x,z) to be possible:
This would mean x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. For similar reasons as TPP, this seems logically possible but would require a very specific configuration where z is a large region that contains all of x, and the boundary of z is distant from x.

For TPPi(x,z) to be possible:
This would mean z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Given that z touches y at a boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z is a small region that's completely within x and touches x's boundary at the same point it touches y's boundary. This is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be possible:
This would mean z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. Given that z touches y at a boundary, this would require z to be completely surrounded by x, but also for z to touch y's boundary without touching x's boundary. This seems geometrically contradictory. I'm leaning towards this not being possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be possible:
This would mean x and z are the same region. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y and z are externally connected, it's hard to see how x and z could be the same region. If they were, then z would also partially overlap with y, which contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected. This is not possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- (I'm not sure about NTPPi(x,z) but leaning towards it not being possible)

Let me reconsider NTPPi(x,z):
For this to be true, z must be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But since EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. It seems like for z to touch y's boundary while being completely inside x, x would have to extend beyond y at that boundary point. But if x extends beyond y at that point, then z would also touch x's boundary. This feels contradictory. 

Actually, wait, that's not necessarily true. Let's visualize: Imagine y as a large square and z as a small square touching one side of y. If x is a larger square that encompasses z and part of y, but doesn't extend to the point where y and z touch, then z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while still touching y's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) seems to be possible.

But wait, that's still not right. If x doesn't extend to the point where y and z touch, then z isn't completely inside x. For z to be inside x, every point of z must be a point of x, including the boundary point of z that touches y. But if that boundary point is a point of x, then z touches x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's try again. The key insight is that the boundary of a region can extend beyond the region itself. So, imagine y as a large square and z as a small square touching one side of y. If x is another square that overlaps with part of y and contains z, but the boundary of x doesn't touch z, then we'd have NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, this is still not right. The boundary of a region is by definition the boundary between that region and everything else. So if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then z has no boundary points that are not interior points of x. But if EC(y,z), then z has a boundary point that touches y's boundary. This boundary point of z would also be a boundary point of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I've been thinking of this the wrong way. Let's be very explicit about the definitions. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. For EC(y,z) to be true, y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. 

Actually, I think the easiest way to reason through this is to be more concrete and consider the predicates in terms of set theory and topology.

For PO(x,y), we have:
- The intersection of the interiors of x and y is non-empty.
- Neither x is a subset of y nor y is a subset of x.

For EC(y,z), we have:
- The intersection of y and z is non-empty.
- The intersection of the interiors of y and z is empty.

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means x and z have an empty intersection. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't reach the boundary of y that touches z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means x and z have a non-empty intersection, but their interiors don't intersect. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y reaches the boundary of y that touches z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means the interiors of x and z have a non-empty intersection, and neither is a subset of the other. Given the constraints, it's hard to see how this could happen, because the interiors of y and z don't intersect, and x overlaps with y. But actually, this can still happen if x extends beyond y and into z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is a proper subset of z, and the boundaries of x and z have a non-empty intersection. Given the constraints, this seems unlikely, but it's not logically ruled out.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is a proper subset of z, and the boundaries of x and z have an empty intersection. This also seems unlikely given the constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is a proper subset of x, and the boundaries of x and z have a non-empty intersection. This is possible if z is a small region that's completely within x and touches x's boundary at the same point it touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is a proper subset of x, and the boundaries of x and z have an empty intersection. Given that z touches y at a boundary, this seems contradictory. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, then y must also extend inside x. But if y extends inside x, and z touches y's boundary, it's hard to see how z wouldn't also touch x's boundary. I'm leaning towards this not being possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means x and z are the same set. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y and z are externally connected, this is not possible.

Let me think through this one more time for clarity.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true:
1. z is a proper subset of x.
2. The boundaries of z and x don't intersect.

Given EC(y,z):
1. y and z touch at their boundaries.
2. The interiors of y and z don't intersect.

Now, if z is touching y at its boundary, and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then the boundary point of z that touches y is an interior point of x. But if y and z touch at their boundaries, and this point is an interior point of x, then y must also extend into the interior of x (because the point is on the boundary of y). And if y extends into the interior of x, and y is also EC to z, then it's hard to visualize how z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Hmm, I'm not sure my reasoning is completely clear. Let me try a different approach.

Let's consider a specific example. Imagine a 2D space where:
- y is a large circle.
- z is a small circle that touches y at a single point.
- x is a region that partially overlaps with y, specifically the left half of y.

Now, if z touches y on the left side, then z might be completely inside x. If z is small enough and positioned correctly, it could be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. This would make NTPPi(x,z) true.

Actually, you know what, I'm overthinking this. I think NTPPi(x,z) is possible. The fact that z touches y at its boundary doesn't necessarily mean it has to touch x's boundary, especially if x extends beyond y at the point where y and z touch.

Let's finalize my analysis:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- DC(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y doesn't reach the boundary of y that touches z.
- EC(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y reaches the boundary of y that touches z.
- PO(x,z): Possible. x extends beyond y and into z.
- TPP(x,z): Possible, but requires a specific configuration where z is a very large region.
- NTPP(x,z): Possible, but also requires a specific configuration.
- TPPi(x,z): Possible. z is a small region that's completely within x and touches x's boundary at the same point it touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible, if x extends beyond y at the point where y and z touch, and z is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were the same region, z would also partially overlap with y, which contradicts EC(y,z).

Wait, I think I'm being too tentative about some of these. Let me think about them more concretely:

For TPP(x,z):
This means x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x partially overlaps with y. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. If x is completely within z, then all the areas where x overlaps with y must also be within z. But this would mean that y and z overlap, which contradicts the fact that EC(y,z). Thus, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
Similarly, if x is completely within z, then the parts of x that overlap with y would also be within z, which would make y and z overlap. This contradicts EC(y,z). Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), z touches y at its boundary. If z is completely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then the boundary point of z that touches y must be an interior point of x. But if this point is an interior point of x, then y must also extend into the interior of x. This seems plausible, especially if y partially overlaps with x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me check NTPPi(x,z) again:
For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If EC(y,z), z touches y at its boundary. Let's visualize: y is a large circle, z is a small circle that touches y at a single point. If x is a region that partially overlaps with y and completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) would be true.

But here's the issue: For z to touch y without touching the boundary of x, x must extend beyond y at the point where y and z touch. But if x extends beyond y at that point, that point would also be a point on the boundary of x (since it's the boundary between x and the rest of the space). But if z touches that point, then z touches the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, wait, that's still not quite right. The boundary of a region is the set of points that have both points inside the region and points outside the region in any neighborhood. If x extends beyond y at the point where y and z touch, that point might be an interior point of x, not a boundary point.

Actually, I think the issue here is that I've been assuming a very simplistic view of boundaries. In a more topological view, the boundary of a region is the closure of the region minus the interior of the region. If x extends beyond y at the point where y and z touch, and if x is a nice, well-behaved region, then that point would indeed be a boundary point of x. But regions can have complex boundaries. For example, x could have a "spike" that extends out to the point where y and z touch, making that point an interior point of x.

Actually, I need to be more careful. The boundary of a region in topology is indeed the closure minus the interior. The closure of a set is the set plus its boundary. The interior of a set is the set minus its boundary.

Let's consider a specific example again. Imagine a 2D space where:
- y is a large square.
- z is a small square that touches y at a single point, say the top-right corner of z touches the top-left corner of y.
- x is a region that partially overlaps with y, extending into the left half of y, and also extends upwards to completely enclose z.

In this configuration, z is completely inside x. But does z touch the boundary of x? If x extends beyond both y and z at the point where they touch, then that point could be an interior point of x, not a boundary point. In that case, z wouldn't touch the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) true.

Actually wait, I think I've been making a mistake in my understanding. If two regions touch at a point, it doesn't necessarily mean that point is on the boundary of both regions. It could be an interior point of one region and a boundary point of the other.

Let's redefine some terms for clarity:
- The boundary of a region is the set of points that have both points inside the region and points outside the region in any neighborhood.
- The interior of a region is the set of points such that there's a neighborhood around each point that's completely contained within the region.
- Two regions are externally connected (EC) if they have a common point, but no common interior point.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider NTPPi(x,z):
For this to be true, z must be completely inside x without any of the boundary points of z being boundary points of x. This means all boundary points of z are interior points of x.

Now, consider EC(y,z). This means y and z have a common point, but no common interior point. Let's say the common point is p. Since p is a point of z, it's either an interior point of z or a boundary point of z. Given that y and z have no common interior point, p must be a boundary point of z. Similarly, p must be a boundary point of y.

So, p is a boundary point of both y and z. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, p (being a boundary point of z) must be an interior point of x. But if p is an interior point of x, and p is also a boundary point of y, then y must extend into the interior of x. This seems plausible, especially if y partially overlaps with x.

In conclusion, I think NTPPi(x,z) is possible. It would require a specific configuration where x extends beyond y at the point where y and z touch, making that point an interior point of x.

So, let's finalize my analysis:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y doesn't reach the boundary of y that touches z.
2. EC(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y reaches the boundary of y that touches z.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. x extends beyond y and into z.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely within z, then y and z would overlap, contradicting EC(y,z).
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP(x,z).
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z is a small region that's completely within x and touches x's boundary at the same point it touches y's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z is completely within x, and the point where z touches y is an interior point of x.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were the same region, z would also partially overlap with y, which contradicts EC(y,z).

But I just realized I may have made a mistake with TPP(x,z). For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z. Given PO(x,y), x partially overlaps with y. But, and this is the key insight, x doesn't have to overlap with y in the parts that are inside z. That is, x could be completely inside z, and the parts of x that overlap with y could be exactly the parts where z touches y. In this way, y and z would still only touch at their boundaries, but x would be completely inside z.

Hmm, let me work through this more carefully:

For TPP(x,z) to be true:
1. x is a proper subset of z.
2. The boundaries of x and z have a non-empty intersection.

Given PO(x,y):
1. The interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection.
2. Neither x is a subset of y nor y is a subset of x.

Given EC(y,z):
1. y and z have a non-empty intersection.
2. The interiors of y and z have an empty intersection.

If x is completely inside z, and x partially overlaps with y, then there's a part of x that's inside y. This part of x is also inside z. But if a part of y contains a part of x, and x is inside z, then there's a part of y that's inside z, which contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I'm pretty confident in this conclusion.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), we'd face the same contradiction. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, then there's a part of y that's inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me confirm once more that NTPPi(x,z) is possible:
For this to be true, z must be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), z touches y at its boundary. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then the boundary point of z that touches y must be an interior point of x. This is possible if x extends beyond y at the point where y and z touch.

I'm quite confident in this analysis now.

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): Possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

Let me actually think through this one last time, starting from PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) and reasoning through each relation between x and z:

For DC(x,z) (x and z are disconnected):
- This means x and z have no common points.
- Given that y and z touch at a point, and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to not reach the point where y and z touch, making DC(x,z) true.
- Example: Imagine y as a large square, z as a small square touching the right side of y, and x as a region that overlaps with the left half of y but doesn't reach the right side.
- DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z) (x and z are externally connected):
- This means x and z touch at a point but don't overlap.
- Given that y and z touch at a point, and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to reach the point where y and z touch, making EC(x,z) true.
- Example: Imagine y as a large square, z as a small square touching the right side of y, and x as a region that overlaps with y and extends to the right side, touching z at the same point where y touches z.
- EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap):
- This means x and z have a common interior part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- Given that y and z touch but don't overlap, and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to extend beyond y and overlap with z.
- Example: Imagine y as a large square, z as a small square touching the right side of y, and x as a region that overlaps with the left half of y and also extends to the right, overlapping with part of z.
- PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z):
- This means x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.
- Given that x overlaps with y, if x is completely contained within z, then the parts of x that overlap with y would also be within z. But if y and z only touch at a boundary and don't overlap, it's not possible for a part of y to be within z.
- TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z):
- This means x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.
- Similar to the TPP case, this is not possible because it would require a part of y to be within z, which contradicts EC(y,z).
- NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x):
- This means z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- Given that y and z touch at a point, and x overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be completely contained within x and for the point where y and z touch to also be a boundary point of x.
- Example: Imagine y as a large square, z as a small square touching the right side of y, and x as a region that completely surrounds z and also overlaps with part of y, with the point where y and z touch being a boundary point of x.
- TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x):
- This means z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.
- Given that y and z touch at a point, and x overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be completely contained within x and for the point where y and z touch to be an interior point of x.
- Example: Imagine y as a large square, z as a small square touching the right side of y, and x as a region that completely surrounds z and extends beyond the point where y and z touch, making that point an interior point of x.
- NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal):
- This means x and z are the same region.
- Given that x partially overlaps with y, if x and z were the same region, z would also partially overlap with y, which contradicts EC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, to summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z): Possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
5. NTPPi(x,z): Possible.

And the impossible relationships are:
1. TPP(x,z): Not possible.
2. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
3. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

I believe this analysis is correct, but I'm also cognizant of the fact that I've made some errors in my reasoning earlier. To be absolutely sure, I'd want to provide concrete examples for each of the possible relations. But I'm confident in the above analysis.

In summary, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

Let me triple check my analysis of NTPPi(x,z) one last time. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If EC(y,z), then z touches y at a boundary point. Let's call this point p. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, p must be an interior point of x. Now, p is also a boundary point of y. 

In fact, let's try to construct a specific example to verify this. Imagine:
- y is a large circle with its center at the origin.
- z is a small circle with its center at (1, 0), and its radius is such that it touches y at the point (0, 0).
- x is a region that encompasses the right half of y, extends to the right to include all of z, and also extends further beyond z. Specifically, x includes the point (0, 0) in its interior, not as a boundary point.

In this example, PO(x,y) is true because x overlaps with half of y, but neither is contained within the other. EC(y,z) is true because y and z touch at the point (0, 0) but don't overlap. And NTPPi(x,z) is true because z is completely inside x, and the point where z touches y, which is (0, 0), is an interior point of x, not a boundary point.

This confirms that NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation given the constraints.

So my final answer is:
The possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap - they share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

Let me analyze each possible relationship:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible if x doesn't extend to the boundary point where y and z touch.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible if x extends exactly to the boundary point where y and z touch.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible if x extends beyond y and overlaps with part of z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Not possible. If x were completely contained in z and PO(x,y), then part of y would have to be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible if z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x and z were identical and PO(x,y), then z would partially overlap with y, contradicting EC(y,z).
