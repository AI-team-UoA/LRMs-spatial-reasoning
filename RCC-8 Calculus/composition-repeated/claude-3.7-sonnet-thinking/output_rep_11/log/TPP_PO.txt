PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's analyze what each of the given relations means:

1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
   - x is completely inside y
   - x touches y's boundary

2. PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z. This means:
   - y and z share some interior points
   - neither is completely contained in the other
   - both y and z have parts that are not in the other

Now we need to determine what are the possible relations between x and z. Let's go through each of the eight RCC-8 relations and check if it's possible:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
   Given that x is inside y, and y overlaps with z, is it possible for x to be completely disconnected from z?
   Yes, it's possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   Can x touch the boundary of z without sharing interior points?
   Yes, it's possible if x touches the boundary of y exactly at the point where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   Can x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other?
   Yes, this is possible if x overlaps with the region where y and z overlap, but also has parts outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   Can x be completely inside z and touch z's boundary?
   Yes, if x is in the overlapping region of y and z, and touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   Can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?
   Yes, if x is in the overlapping region of y and z, and is sufficiently far from z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part (z is a TPP of x):
   Can z be completely inside x and touch x's boundary?
   No, this is not possible. Since x is contained in y (TPP(x,y)), and z is not contained in y (PO(y,z)), it's impossible for z to be contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part (z is an NTPP of x):
   Can z be completely inside x without touching x's boundary?
   No, for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   Can x and z be the same region?
   No, because x is strictly contained in y (TPP(x,y)), but z is not contained in y (PO(y,z)).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check by thinking about concrete examples:

Imagine y as a large circle. Since TPP(x,y), x is a smaller circle that touches the boundary of y from the inside. Since PO(y,z), z is another circle that partially overlaps with y.

Now let's think about the different possibilities for the position of z relative to x:

1. DC(x,z): z can be positioned so that it overlaps with y but is completely separate from x.
2. EC(x,z): z can be positioned so that it just touches x at a point, while still partially overlapping with y.
3. PO(x,z): z can be positioned so that it partially overlaps with x, while still partially overlapping with y.
4. TPP(x,z): z can be positioned so that it completely contains x, with x touching the boundary of z, while z still partially overlaps with y.
5. NTPP(x,z): z can be positioned so that it completely contains x, with x not touching the boundary of z, while z still partially overlaps with y.

So my analysis confirms that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me just double-check with a slightly different approach to confirm:

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely contained in y
- x touches the boundary of y

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z share some interior points
- both y and z have parts that are not in the other

Now, let's think about where x can be located relative to z:

1. If x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z at all, then DC(x,z).
2. If x is in a part of y that just touches z at the boundary, then EC(x,z).
3. If x is partly in the overlap region of y and z, and partly in y but not in z, then PO(x,z).
4. If x is completely in the overlap region of y and z, and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z).
5. If x is completely in the overlap region of y and z, and x does not touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z).

These are the only possibilities given the constraints, which confirms our answer:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely contained within y
- x touches y's boundary

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z partially overlap
- neither is contained within the other
- both have parts not shared with the other

Now I'll analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible if x touches z's boundary in the region where y and z meet.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x partially extends into the y-z overlap region.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely within the y-z overlap region and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely within the y-z overlap region without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible because x is contained in y while z is not.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because x must be properly contained in y while z is not.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
