PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze the possible relationships between x and z given that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's recall the definitions:
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now I need to determine what this implies for the relationship between x and z.

Given that EC(x,y), x and y share a boundary point but no interior.
Given that TPP(y,z), y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Let's think about the possible configurations:

1. Since x touches y at the boundary (EC), and y touches z's boundary (TPP), it's possible that x could touch z at the boundary as well. This would give us EC(x,z).

2. It's also possible that x could be disconnected from z entirely. This would give us DC(x,z).

3. It's possible that x and z could partially overlap. This would give us PO(x,z).

4. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, and x touches y only at the boundary, it's not possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. It's possible that x could be inside z and touching z's boundary, which would give us TPP(x,z).

6. Since x is not necessarily larger than z, it's not possible to guarantee that z is a proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not necessarily true.

7. Since x and y are only touching at the boundary (EC), and y is strictly contained within z (TPP), it's not possible for x and z to be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

For DC(x,z):
If x touches y only at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, it's possible that x could be completely outside z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z):
If x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z at the boundary, it's possible for x to also touch z at the boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, it's possible for x to partially overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, it's possible for x to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z at the boundary, it seems unlikely that x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. However, this might be possible in some configurations. Let me think about this more...

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) is not possible because if x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z at the boundary, then x must either touch z at the boundary or be outside z.

Let me double-check this. If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. x touches y at the boundary. If x were completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP), then it couldn't touch y at the boundary because y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, it's possible for z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, it's possible for z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me think about TPPi and NTPPi more carefully. If TPP(y,z), then z is larger than y and contains it. Given that x only touches y at the boundary, it's not clear that x could contain z. Let me reconsider...

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a tangential proper part of x. But if TPP(y,z), then z contains y. And if EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at the boundary. It doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x in this case. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a non-tangential proper part of x. But again, if z contains y (as TPP(y,z) indicates), and x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), then z cannot be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and y touch only at the boundary, and y is strictly contained within z, then x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me try to think about it from a slightly different angle using the properties of these spatial relations.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y share a boundary but no interior points.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since TPP(y,z), y is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. 

Let's consider the point (or set of points) where x and y touch. Call this set of points p.

Since EC(x,y), p is a subset of both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.
Since TPP(y,z), the boundary of y can be divided into two parts: one part that touches the boundary of z, and one part that is inside z.

If p is on the part of y's boundary that touches z's boundary, then x and z would also touch at the boundary, giving us EC(x,z). Actually, I'm not sure this is necessarily true, let me think...

Actually, even if p is on the part of y's boundary that touches z's boundary, it's not guaranteed that x touches z. It could be that x and y touch at a point that is inside z. In this case, x would partially overlap with z, giving us PO(x,z).

So, p could be on the part of y's boundary that is inside z, or on the part that touches z's boundary.

If p is on the part of y's boundary that is inside z, then part of x's boundary is inside z. This could give us a few possibilities:
- Part of x could be inside z and part outside, giving us PO(x,z).
- All of x could be inside z, touching z's boundary, giving us TPP(x,z).
- All of x could be inside z, not touching z's boundary, giving us NTPP(x,z).

But wait, I need to be more careful about the last case. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. If p is on the part of y's boundary that is inside z, then that part of x's boundary is also inside z. But this doesn't guarantee that all of x is inside z. It could still be that part of x extends outside z, which would give us PO(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this from a different angle. If we consider the complement of z, which I'll denote as z', then TPP(y,z) implies that y is disjoint from z'. Since EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. This means that x could overlap with z', or it could be disjoint from z'.

If x overlaps with z', then it's not contained within z, which gives us either DC(x,z), EC(x,z), or PO(x,z).

If x is disjoint from z', then it's contained within z, which gives us TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or EQ(x,z).

But since EC(x,y) implies that x and y are distinct, and TPP(y,z) implies that y and z are distinct, x and z must also be distinct, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think I need to be more careful in my reasoning.

Let's denote the topological boundary of a region r as B(r), and the topological interior as I(r). 

Given:
- EC(x,y): B(x) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅ and I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅.
- TPP(y,z): y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and B(y) ∩ B(z) ≠ ∅.

What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's consider the point (or set of points) where x and y touch. Call this set of points p. So p = B(x) ∩ B(y).

Since TPP(y,z), y is contained within z, which means that both I(y) and B(y) are contained within z. So p, which is a subset of B(y), is also contained within z.

This gives us a few possibilities:

1. If p is the only part of x that intersects with z, and p is on the boundary of z, then x and z touch at the boundary, giving us EC(x,z).

2. If p is the only part of x that intersects with z, and p is in the interior of z, then x and z don't share any points, giving us DC(x,z). Actually, this doesn't make sense. If p is in z, then x and z share points, so they can't be disconnected. Let me rethink this...

Actually, if p is contained within z, then x and z must share some points (at least those in p). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

3. If some part of x other than p is also inside z, but not all of x is inside z, then x and z partially overlap, giving us PO(x,z).

4. If all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z, then x is a tangential proper part of z, giving us TPP(x,z).

5. If all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, giving us NTPP(x,z).

Options 4 and 5 require all of x to be inside z. But given that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's not clear that this is always possible. 

Hmm, let me reconsider. Given that EC(x,y), x shares a boundary with y but no interior points. Given that TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If p = B(x) ∩ B(y) is the set of points where x and y touch, then p is contained within z (since all of y is in z).

So x and z must share some points (at least those in p). This means that DC(x,z) is not possible.

Now, p could be on the boundary of z (since y touches the boundary of z). If this is the case, and no other part of x is inside z, then x and z touch at the boundary, giving us EC(x,z).

If some part of x other than p is inside z, but not all of x is inside z, then x and z partially overlap, giving us PO(x,z).

If all of x is inside z, there are two possibilities: either x touches the boundary of z, giving us TPP(x,z), or x doesn't touch the boundary of z, giving us NTPP(x,z).

Now, let's consider each of these possibilities and see if they're consistent with the given constraints.

EC(x,z): This is possible if p is on the boundary of z, and no other part of x is inside z.

PO(x,z): This is possible if some part of x other than p is inside z, but not all of x is inside z.

TPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z.

NTPP(x,z): For this to be possible, all of x would need to be inside z, and x would not touch the boundary of z. But since p is on the boundary of y, and EC(x,y), at least part of x touches y. If p is on the part of y's boundary that touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) impossible. But if p is on the part of y's boundary that is inside z (not touching z's boundary), then it's possible for all of x to be inside z without touching z's boundary, giving us NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me take a step back. I think I'm making things too complicated.

If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with it. The question is: what could be the relationship between x and z?

Since y is inside z and x touches y, x and z must at least share a point (the point where x touches y). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Since x doesn't overlap with y, and y is inside z, it's possible for x to not overlap with z as well. In this case, x would touch z at the boundary, giving us EC(x,z).

It's also possible for x to overlap with z. If this is the case, it could be a partial overlap (PO(x,z)), or x could be completely inside z.

If x is completely inside z, it could either touch z's boundary (TPP(x,z)) or not (NTPP(x,z)).

Since y is inside z and x touches y, it's not possible for z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Since x and y are distinct, and y and z are distinct, x and z must also be distinct. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But wait, I need to reconsider NTPP(x,z). For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would have to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y touches z at the boundary.

Now, the question is: can x touch y at the boundary, while being completely inside z without touching z's boundary? If the point where x and y touch is on the part of y's boundary that touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) impossible. But if the point where x and y touch is on the part of y's boundary that is inside z (not touching z's boundary), then it's possible for x to be inside z without touching z's boundary.

So NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible, but only in the specific case where x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that is not on z's boundary.

Let me verify this with a concrete example. Consider a nested set of circles:
- z is the outermost circle.
- y is a circle inside z, touching z at a point.
- x is a circle inside z, not touching z, but touching y at a point that is not where y touches z.

In this example, EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) hold, and the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

One moment, let me double-check whether DC(x,z) is possible. I initially concluded it wasn't, but let me verify.

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. The question is: can x be completely outside z?

If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then x and z must share at least the point where x touches y. So x cannot be completely outside z, which means DC(x,z) is not possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning once more.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's denote the point (or set of points) where x and y touch as p.

Since TPP(y,z), y is inside z. This means that p, which is on the boundary of y, is also inside or on the boundary of z.

If p is on the boundary of z, then x and z touch at the boundary, giving us EC(x,z).

If p is inside z, then there are a few possibilities:
- x could be partially inside z, giving us PO(x,z).
- x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary at some point, giving us TPP(x,z).
- x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, giving us NTPP(x,z).

It's also possible that x extends outside of z, but still touches y at p. In this case, since p is inside or on the boundary of z, x and z must share at least that point. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Since y is inside z and x touches y, it's not possible for z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Since x and y are distinct, and y and z are distinct, x and z must also be distinct. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But wait, I need to double-check if this is indeed the case for DC(x,z).

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a point that is inside z (not on z's boundary), then x and z share that point, so they are not disconnected. If x touches y at a point that is on z's boundary, then x and z also share that point, so they are not disconnected.

But is it possible for x to touch y at a point that is neither inside z nor on z's boundary? No, because TPP(y,z) implies that all of y, including its boundary, is either inside z or on z's boundary. So it's not possible for x to touch y at a point that is outside z.

Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I need to be a bit more careful about DC(x,z). If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. The question is: can x be completely outside z?

If TPP(y,z), then all of y, including its boundary, is inside or on the boundary of z. This means that any point where x touches y is either inside z or on the boundary of z. If x touches y at a point on the boundary of z, then x also touches z at that point, so they are not disconnected. If x touches y at a point inside z, then x and z share that point, so they are not disconnected.

So, regardless of where x touches y, x and z must share at least one point. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

First, I'll determine what's definitely not possible:

- DC(x,z) is impossible: Since x touches y at the boundary and y is inside z, x must share at least one point with z (the point where x touches y).

- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible: These would require z to be a proper part of x, but since y is already a proper part of z and x only touches y at a boundary, z cannot be contained in x.

- EQ(x,z) is impossible: Since y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, x and z cannot be equal.

Now for the possible relationships:

1. EC(x,z): Possible if x touches y exactly at the point where y touches z's boundary, with no other part of x entering z.

2. PO(x,z): Possible if part of x extends into z (beyond just touching y) but another part of x remains outside z.

3. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

4. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely contained inside z without touching z's boundary (x touches y at a point of y's boundary that is not on z's boundary).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
