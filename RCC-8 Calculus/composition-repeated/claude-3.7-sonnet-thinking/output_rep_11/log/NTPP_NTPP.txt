PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's recall the definitions of the relations:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x).
7. NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

We're told that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, it means x is contained entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary. And since y is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means y is contained entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary.

So, transitively, x must be contained entirely within z. Moreover, since x does not touch y's boundary and y does not touch z's boundary, it follows that x cannot touch z's boundary. Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Wait, let me double-check. If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z. So x must be a proper part of z. Furthermore, since x doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary, x can't touch z's boundary. So x must be a non-tangential proper part of z. That's NTPP(x,z).

Let's go through each relation and see if it's possible:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know x is contained in y and y is contained in z, so x is contained in z. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. But we know x is contained in y and y is contained in z, so x is contained in z and must share interior parts with z. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. But we know x is contained in y and y is contained in z, so x is contained in z. This means x is a part of z. Thus, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is part of z and touches z's boundary. We know x is contained in y and y is contained in z. But we also know y does not touch z's boundary. Since x is contained within y, x cannot touch z's boundary. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. We know x is contained in y and y is contained in z, so x is contained in z. Furthermore, y doesn't touch z's boundary, so x, being inside y, can't touch z's boundary. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is part of x and touches x's boundary. But we know x is contained in y and y is contained in z, so z cannot be a part of x. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. But we know x is contained in y and y is contained in z, so z cannot be a part of x. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But we know x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, so x cannot be equal to z. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this one more time. 

We're given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). 

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (x is a subset of y).
- x does not touch y's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (y is a subset of z).
- y does not touch z's boundary.

From these, we can conclude:
- x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z. By transitivity, x is a proper part of z.
- y does not touch z's boundary, and x is contained inside y (without touching y's boundary). Therefore, x also cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, which is exactly the definition of NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check once more. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is contained inside y without touching its boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is contained inside z without touching its boundary.

Visual representation:
```
z: [           ]
   y: [      ]
      x: [ ]
```

Clearly, x is contained inside z without touching its boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is that the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) tell us about the spatial arrangement.

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is properly contained within y
- x does not touch y's boundary

NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is properly contained within z
- y does not touch z's boundary

Given these conditions:
1. Since x is properly contained in y, and y is properly contained in z, then x must be properly contained in z.
2. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is entirely within y (not touching y's boundary), then x cannot possibly touch z's boundary.

These two facts together mean that x is properly contained within z without touching z's boundary, which is precisely the definition of NTPP(x,z).
