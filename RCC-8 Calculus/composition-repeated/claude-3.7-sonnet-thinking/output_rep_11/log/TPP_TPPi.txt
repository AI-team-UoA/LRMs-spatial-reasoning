PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me work through the problem step by step.

We know that:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Since both x and z are parts of y and both touch y's boundary, there are several possibilities for how x and z relate to each other.

Let me analyze the possibilities by considering the RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Since both are inside y and touch its boundary, they could be in different parts of y, not touching each other at all.
2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries? Yes, they could both touch y's boundary and also touch each other at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they could share some common area while each having some area that the other doesn't.
4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, x could be inside z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? Yes, they could be the same region, both being tangential proper parts of y.

Let me double-check each of these possibilities by considering the constraints:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

For DC(x,z):
If x and z are both parts of y touching y's boundary, they could be in different "corners" of y, not touching each other. This seems possible.

For EC(x,z):
If x and z are both parts of y touching y's boundary, they could also touch each other at a boundary. This seems possible.

For PO(x,z):
If x and z are both parts of y touching y's boundary, they could overlap partially. This seems possible.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, and z is part of y touching y's boundary, then x is also part of y and could touch y's boundary (through z). This seems possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and z is part of y touching y's boundary, then x is still part of y but might not touch y's boundary. This would violate TPP(x,y) which requires x to touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and z is part of y touching y's boundary, then x is also part of y. But for z to touch y's boundary, x must also touch y's boundary at the same point. This seems possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z is part of y touching y's boundary, then for z to touch y's boundary, x must also touch y's boundary at the same point. But this contradicts the definition of NTPPi, which requires z to not touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are equal, and both are tangential proper parts of y, then all conditions are satisfied. This seems possible.

Wait, I think I need to be more precise. Let me reconsider some of these cases:

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and z is part of y touching y's boundary, then x is also part of y. But since x doesn't touch z's boundary, and part of z's boundary is y's boundary, x cannot touch y's boundary. This violates TPP(x,y), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, then z must touch x's boundary at the point where it touches y's boundary. This contradicts the definition of NTPPi. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, and z is part of y touching y's boundary, we need to ensure x still touches y's boundary. This is possible if x touches z's boundary at a point where z touches y's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z):
Similarly, if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, then z must touch x's boundary at a point where it touches y's boundary. This seems possible.

Now, let me verify the remaining cases:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

For DC(x,z):
If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any parts. But they both touch y's boundary. This means they touch y's boundary at different points. This seems consistent with TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

For EC(x,z):
If x and z touch at their boundaries, they still don't share interior parts. They both touch y's boundary, possibly at the same point or different points. This seems consistent.

For PO(x,z):
If x and z partially overlap, they share some parts but not all. They both touch y's boundary, possibly sharing some boundary points with y. This seems consistent.

Let me make a final check by considering the transitive closure of these relations.
For TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y), the composition table for RCC-8 would give us the possible relations between x and z.

Actually, we have TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y). Let me check what the composition table says for this scenario.

Actually, I need to be careful here. We have TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y). This doesn't directly give us the relation between x and z.

Let me redraw the problem. 
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So the hierarchy is: x is inside y, which is inside z. Both x and y touch their respective "containers" at the boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x must be inside z. But does x touch z's boundary?

If y touches z's boundary and x touches y's boundary, there are two possibilities:
1. x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x also touches z's boundary, making it TPP(x,z).
2. x touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary. In this case, x doesn't touch z's boundary, making it NTPP(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. I think I made an error.

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This gives us the structure where both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? Since both are inside y and touch y's boundary, they could be:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, located in different parts of y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

I think NTPP and NTPPi are not possible because both x and z touch y's boundary, so if one is completely inside the other, it would need to touch the other's boundary at the point where it touches y's boundary.

Wait, let me reconsider the definition of TPPi. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. But that would mean both x and z are inside y, which doesn't give us a hierarchical structure where y is inside z.

Let me re-interpret TPPi(y,z) using the definition:
- TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of the inverse of z, which doesn't make sense.
- TPPi(y,z) means the inverse of TPP(y,z), which would be TPP(z,y).
- Let's see, I think the "i" stands for "inverse", so TPPi(y,z) means the inverse of TPP(y,z), which is TPP(z,y).

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now, with this understanding:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. They both are inside y and touch y's boundary.

With this understanding, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, located in different parts of y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. (This is possible if z is larger than x and both touch y's boundary.)
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. (This is possible if x is larger than z and both touch y's boundary.)
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

OK, I think I made a mistake in my interpretation. Let me re-analyze this more carefully.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, and x touches y's boundary at at least one point.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is completely inside y, and z touches y's boundary at at least one point.

Given these, both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they could be in different parts of y, not sharing any points.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping? Yes, they could be adjacent within y, touching at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they could share some common region while each having some unique region.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible because even if x touches y's boundary, it might not touch z's boundary if z is larger and encompasses x completely.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, similar to the reasoning for NTPP.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? Yes, they could be the same region, both being tangential proper parts of y.

So, all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me be more systematic.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z): TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. They are both completely inside y and touch y's boundary.

Let's consider the RCC-8 composition table for this situation. The composition TPP(x,y) ∘ TPP(z,y) (which is NOT directly applicable here because we're not composing relations in a chain) would tell us about the relation between x and z if we were given that TPP(y,z), not TPP(z,y).

Instead, let's reason directly about the possible relationships between two regions that are both tangential proper parts of a third region.

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they could be in different parts of y, not sharing any points.
2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping? Yes, they could be adjacent within y, touching at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they could share some common region while each having some unique region.
4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? Yes, they could be the same region, both being tangential proper parts of y.

Based on the spatial constraints, all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when both are tangential proper parts of y.

Hmm, wait, I think I'm still missing a key insight here. Let me really think about the physical implications.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary.

Let me think about the constraints more carefully:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be completely disconnected? Yes, they can be in different parts of y, not sharing any points.
   
2. EC(x,z): Can x and z externally connect (touch at a boundary)? Yes, they can be adjacent within y, touching at a boundary.
   
3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share some common region while each having some unique region.
   
4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that both x and z are inside y, and z touches y's boundary, this is possible. But it's crucial that x touches z's boundary at a point where z touches y's boundary for x to also touch y's boundary, as required by TPP(x,y).
   
5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, how can it touch y's boundary (as required by TPP(x,y))? It can't. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.
   
6. TPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of TPP(x,z), so it means z is a tangential proper part of x. Similar to the reasoning for TPP(x,z), z must touch x's boundary at a point where x touches y's boundary for z to also touch y's boundary. This is possible.
   
7. NTPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(x,z), so it means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Using the same reasoning as for NTPP(x,z), if z doesn't touch x's boundary, it can't touch y's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.
   
8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? Yes, they can be the same region, both being tangential proper parts of y.

Given these constraints, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): Disconnected
- EC(x,z): Externally connected
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

The impossible relationships are:
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Let me verify that once more.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x can't touch y's boundary because z forms a buffer between x and y. But TPP(x,y) requires x to touch y's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x): If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then z can't touch y's boundary because x forms a buffer between z and y. But TPPi(y,z) (or TPP(z,y)) requires z to touch y's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Yes, I'm confident in my conclusion.

Actually, let me be even more careful and precise. Let's consider each relation one at a time, and I'll be very explicit.

1. DC(x,z):
   - Definition: x and z are disconnected.
   - Given TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Given TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be in different parts of y, both touching y's boundary but not sharing any points with each other.
   - Verdict: DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   - Definition: x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
   - Given TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Given TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Can x and z touch at a boundary? Yes, they can be adjacent within y, touching at a boundary, while both also touching y's boundary.
   - Verdict: EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   - Definition: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but not all.
   - Given TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Given TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share some region while each having a unique part, and both can touch y's boundary.
   - Verdict: PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z):
   - Definition: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   - Given TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Given TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x must be inside z, and x must touch z's boundary. Additionally, for x to touch y's boundary (as required by TPP(x,y)), it must touch z's boundary at a point where z touches y's boundary.
   - This scenario is physically possible: Imagine z as a larger region inside y that touches y's boundary, and x as a smaller region inside z that touches z's boundary precisely at a point where z touches y's boundary.
   - Verdict: TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   - Definition: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - Given TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Given TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? If x doesn't touch z's boundary, it can't touch y's boundary (because z forms a buffer between x and y). But TPP(x,y) requires x to touch y's boundary.
   - This contradiction means that NTPP(x,z) is not possible given the constraints.
   - Verdict: NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x):
   - Definition: z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
   - Given TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Given TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Can z be a tangential proper part of x? For this to be true, z must be inside x, and z must touch x's boundary. Additionally, for z to touch y's boundary (as required by TPP(z,y)), it must touch x's boundary at a point where x touches y's boundary.
   - This scenario is physically possible: Imagine x as a larger region inside y that touches y's boundary, and z as a smaller region inside x that touches x's boundary precisely at a point where x touches y's boundary.
   - Verdict: TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x):
   - Definition: z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - Given TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Given TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? If z doesn't touch x's boundary, it can't touch y's boundary (because x forms a buffer between z and y). But TPP(z,y) requires z to touch y's boundary.
   - This contradiction means that NTPPi(x,z) is not possible given the constraints.
   - Verdict: NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
   - Definition: x and z are the same region.
   - Given TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Given TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
   - Can x and z be the same region? Yes, if x and z are the same, they both satisfy the conditions of being inside y and touching y's boundary.
   - Verdict: EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): Disconnected
- EC(x,z): Externally connected
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

The impossible relationships are:
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Wait, I've been consistently reading the problem statement correctly, but I realize I've been getting confused in my analysis. Let me read the problem one more time and be crystal clear about the constraints.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y). So, z is a tangential proper part of y. z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So, both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, I think I've been consistent in my interpretation throughout, and my conclusion seems right. Let's double-check once more.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But since TPP(x,y) requires x to touch y's boundary, and z is inside y with z touching y's boundary, the only way for x to touch y's boundary is to touch z's boundary at a point where z touches y's boundary. If x doesn't touch z's boundary (as in NTPP), then x can't touch y's boundary, contradicting TPP(x,y).

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But since TPP(z,y) requires z to touch y's boundary, and x is inside y with x touching y's boundary, the only way for z to touch y's boundary is to touch x's boundary at a point where x touches y's boundary. If z doesn't touch x's boundary (as in NTPP(z,x)), then z can't touch y's boundary, contradicting TPP(z,y).

All other relations allow both x and z to touch y's boundary, so they are possible.

The possible relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): Disconnected
- EC(x,z): Externally connected
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

And the impossible relationships are:
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the relationships between x, y, and z given the conditions:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

So both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. Let me analyze each possible relationship:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z can be in different parts of y while both touching y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z can touch at their boundaries while both touching y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap while both touching y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be inside z and touch z's boundary at a point where z touches y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - if x doesn't touch z's boundary (which NTPP requires), then x cannot touch y's boundary (which TPP(x,y) requires).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be inside x and touch x's boundary at a point where x touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - if z doesn't touch x's boundary, then z cannot touch y's boundary (which TPPi(y,z) requires).

8. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be the same region.
