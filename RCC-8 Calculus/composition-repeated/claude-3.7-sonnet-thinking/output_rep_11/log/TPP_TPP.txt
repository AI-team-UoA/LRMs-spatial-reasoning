PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what TPP(x,y) means: x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
Similarly, TPP(y,z) means: y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Given that x is part of y, and y is part of z, we know that x is part of z (by the transitivity of the part-of relation). But we need to determine more specifically which of the RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z.

Let's consider each of the possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because x is part of y and y is part of z, so x must be part of z, which means they share spatial parts.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This is also impossible because x is part of z, so they do share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is impossible because x is part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. If x touches y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, then x could touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This is also possible. If x is inside y without touching y's boundary, or if x touches y's boundary only at parts where y does not touch z's boundary, then x would not touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is impossible because x is part of y and y is part of z, so z cannot be part of x (by the antisymmetry of the part-of relation).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is also impossible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This is impossible because if x is part of y and y is part of z, and y touches the boundary of z, then x and z cannot be equal.

So, the possible relationships are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by carefully thinking about some specific scenarios.

Scenario 1: TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), with x touching z's boundary.
Here, x is part of y and touches y's boundary. y is part of z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 2: TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), with x not touching z's boundary.
Here, x is part of y and touches y's boundary. y is part of z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary only at points where y does not touch z's boundary, then x would not touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more explicit to double-check the NTPP(x,z) case, since I want to be sure x can be a non-tangential proper part of z.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is wholly contained within y and x touches the boundary of y.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is wholly contained within z and y touches the boundary of z.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be wholly contained within z and x must not touch the boundary of z.

Given that x is wholly contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), and y is wholly contained within z (from TPP(y,z)), we know that x is wholly contained within z.

Now, does x touch the boundary of z? Not necessarily. Even though x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, it's possible that x touches y's boundary only at points where y does not touch z's boundary. In this case, x would not touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me try thinking about this problem in a different way, using a specific example to double-check.

Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z but touching z's boundary, and x as an even smaller circle inside y.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) true.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y does not touch z's boundary, then x would not touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Let me verify this yet again, thinking about a possible counterexample. Could there be any other RCC-8 relation that could hold between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z)?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because x is part of y and y is part of z, so x must be part of z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This is impossible because x is part of z, so they share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is impossible because x is part of z.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because x is part of y and y is part of z, so z cannot be part of x.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

6. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is impossible because if x is part of y and y is part of z, and y touches the boundary of z, then x and z cannot be equal.

So, the only possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check EQ(x,z) once more. For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be the same region. If TPP(x,y), then x is a proper part of y, meaning x is a strict subset of y. Similarly, if TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z, meaning y is a strict subset of z. By transitivity, x is a strict subset of z, which means x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is indeed impossible.

To confirm, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships can hold between x and z when TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

Since x is part of y and y is part of z, x must be part of z (by transitivity of the part-of relation). This immediately eliminates several relations: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

The remaining question is whether x touches z's boundary or not:

1. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x will also touch z's boundary → TPP(x,z)

2. If x touches y's boundary only at points where y does not touch z's boundary, then x will not touch z's boundary → NTPP(x,z)

Both scenarios are possible given the constraints.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
