{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Based on the RCC-8 calculus relations:\n\n1. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts\n2. EQ(y,z) means y and z occupy exactly the same spatial region\n\nSince y and z are identical spatial regions (EQ(y,z)), any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Because x is externally connected to y, and z is identical to y, x must also be externally connected to z.\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 13.286871671676636, "reasoning-tokens": 444, "completion-tokens": 444}
