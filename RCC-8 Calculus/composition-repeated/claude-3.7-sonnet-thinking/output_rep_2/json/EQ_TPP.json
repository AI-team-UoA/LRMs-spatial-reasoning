{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Let me analyze what we know:\n\n1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (identical in spatial extent)\n2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)\n\nSince x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), x must have exactly the same spatial relationship with z that y has with z. \n\nSince y is a tangential proper part of z that touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), x must also be a tangential proper part of z that touches z's boundary.\n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 10.886329174041748, "reasoning-tokens": 658, "completion-tokens": 658}
