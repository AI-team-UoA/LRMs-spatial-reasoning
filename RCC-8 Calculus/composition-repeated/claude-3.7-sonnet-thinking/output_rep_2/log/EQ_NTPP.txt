PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this.

First, let's understand the given conditions:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial entity. They have the same size, shape, and location.

Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Given that x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), and y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), it follows that x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z would be NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this by thinking about the definition of NTPP: NTPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Given that:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same spatial entity.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x and y are the same, if y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is also a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationship(s) between x and z given the following:
- EQ(x,y): x and y coincide (occupy exactly the same space)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (fully contained in z without touching z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial entity with identical spatial properties. 

Since y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), and x coincides with y (EQ(x,y)), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
