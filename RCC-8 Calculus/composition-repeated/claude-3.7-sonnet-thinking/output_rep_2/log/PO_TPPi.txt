PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze what we know:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share some parts but neither is a part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y. This means that z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that z is inside y (touching y's boundary) and x partially overlaps with y, there are several possible configurations for x and z:

1. x and z might be completely disconnected (DC) if the part of y that x overlaps with is completely separate from z.

2. x and z might externally connect (EC) if x touches z at the boundary but doesn't overlap with it. This can happen if x touches y at the same place where z touches y's boundary.

3. x and z might partially overlap (PO) if x extends into z.

4. x might be a tangential proper part of z (TPP) if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. x might be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP) if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

The other possibilities are:

6. z might be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi) if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. z might be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi) if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. x and z might be equal (EQ) if they coincide.

Let me analyze each of these possibilities more carefully to see which ones are consistent with the given constraints.

1. DC(x,z):
   - x and z are disconnected.
   - Given that z is inside y and x partially overlaps with y, they might be disconnected if they don't share any points.
   - This is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   - x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points.
   - Given that z is inside y and touches y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, they might touch at the boundary if x touches y at the same place where z touches y's boundary.
   - This is possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   - x and z partially overlap.
   - Given that z is inside y and x partially overlaps with y, they might partially overlap if part of x extends into z.
   - This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z):
   - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.
   - Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, this scenario would require x to be completely inside z, which means x is also completely inside y. But this contradicts the fact that x partially overlaps with y, which means x is not completely inside y.
   - This is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary.
   - Similar to the TPP case, this would require x to be completely inside y, which contradicts the partial overlap relation between x and y.
   - This is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - For this to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.
   - Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, this scenario would require z to be completely inside the overlapping region of x and y, and z must touch the boundary of both x and y.
   - This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - For this to be true, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary.
   - Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, this scenario would require z to be completely inside the overlapping region of x and y, and z must not touch the boundary of x but must touch the boundary of y.
   - This seems inconsistent because if z touches the boundary of y but not the boundary of x, then z can't be completely inside x. But actually I made a small mistake, since y and x overlap, the boundary of y could be partly outside of x, so z could touch that part of y's boundary and not x's boundary. So z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while still touching y's boundary.
   - This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
   - x and z are equal.
   - Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, this would mean x is also a tangential proper part of y.
   - But PO(x,y) means that x partially overlaps with y, which contradicts the idea that x is a tangential proper part of y.
   - This is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC (Disconnected)
- EC (Externally Connected)
- PO (Partially Overlapping)
- TPPi (z is a Tangential Proper Part of x)
- NTPPi (z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x)

I'm a bit unsure of my reasoning here, so let me double-check, especially for the TPPi and NTPPi cases.

For TPPi(x,z):
We know that TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y). So z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
We also know that PO(x,y), so x and y share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other.
Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x? If z is inside y and touches y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, then z could indeed be inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and it could touch x's boundary within y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
Similarly, z could be completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and it might not touch x's boundary at all, making NTPPi(x,z) possible as well.

Actually I think my conclusions are correct. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC (Disconnected)
- EC (Externally Connected)
- PO (Partially Overlapping)
- TPPi (z is a Tangential Proper Part of x)
- NTPPi (z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x)

But actually let me think about this a little more carefully.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

This means:
1. x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
2. z contains y completely, and y touches z's boundary.

Let's think about this geometrically. In a 2D setting:
- y is a smaller shape inside z, touching the boundary of z.
- x is a shape that partially overlaps with y, meaning some parts of x are inside y and some parts are outside y.

Now, let's consider all possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z don't share any points. But since x partially overlaps with y, and y is inside z, at least some part of x is inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. But since x partially overlaps with y, and y is inside z, at least some part of x is inside z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is inside z, some part of x is inside z. But since y is only a part of z, it's also possible for x to extend beyond z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. It's possible for x to overlap with y in such a way that x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, it's possible for x to overlap with y in such a way that x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know z contains y completely, and x doesn't contain y completely (since they partially overlap). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to the above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. But we know y partially overlaps with x, which means some part of y is outside x. But this contradicts the fact that y is entirely inside z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO (Partially Overlapping)
- TPP (x is a Tangential Proper Part of z)
- NTPP (x is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of z)

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning above. I was thinking of TPPi(y,z) as "y is a tangential proper part of z", but TPPi(y,z) actually means the inverse, i.e., "z is a tangential proper part of y".

So correcting:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This is the same as TPP(z,y).

This means:
1. x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
2. z is a smaller shape inside y, touching the boundary of y.

Oh, actually it was right the first time. TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y).

Let me just go through this one more time:

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let me reconsider all possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points. Since x partially overlaps with y, and z is inside y, there are two possibilities: either x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't contain z (in which case DC(x,z) is possible), or x overlaps with a part of y that does contain z (in which case x and z would not be disconnected). So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. Similar to the above, if x touches z at the boundary of y, then EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. This is definitely possible, especially if x extends into z but also extends outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But since x partially overlaps with y, and z is a tangential proper part of y, x would have to be inside a smaller shape (z) that's inside y, while also extending outside of y. This is geometrically inconsistent. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to the above, this is geometrically inconsistent. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if the part of y that x overlaps with contains z. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also possible, similar to the above. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. But since x partially overlaps with y, and z is inside y, they can't be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC (Disconnected)
- EC (Externally Connected)
- PO (Partially Overlapping)
- TPPi (z is a Tangential Proper Part of x)
- NTPPi (z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x)

I think there is an issue with my reasoning for the TPP and NTPP cases. Let me re-examine them:

For TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is smaller than y. And since x partially overlaps with y, it extends outside of y. This means x can't be entirely inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But as argued above, x can't be entirely inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So my conclusion was correct (at least for these two cases), and the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC (Disconnected)
- EC (Externally Connected)
- PO (Partially Overlapping)
- TPPi (z is a Tangential Proper Part of x)
- NTPPi (z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x)

Hmm, wait, let me think about the TPP and NTPP cases one more time:

For TPP(x,z): 
We have PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) which is the same as TPP(z,y).

PO(x,y) means x and y share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
TPP(z,y) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

If TPP(x,z) were true, it would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
But since z is inside y, and x is not fully inside y (due to PO(x,y)), it's not possible for x to be fully inside z.
So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
Similarly, if NTPP(x,z) were true, it would mean x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
Again, since z is inside y, and x is not fully inside y, it's not possible for x to be fully inside z.
So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed:
- DC (Disconnected)
- EC (Externally Connected)
- PO (Partially Overlapping)
- TPPi (z is a Tangential Proper Part of x)
- NTPPi (z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x)

Let me test this by thinking of some concrete examples:

1. DC(x,z): 
Imagine y is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y.
x is another circle that overlaps with the part of y that doesn't contain z.
In this case, x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): 
Imagine y is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y at a point p.
x is another circle that overlaps with y in such a way that x also touches the point p.
In this case, x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): 
Imagine y is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y.
x is another circle that overlaps with y in such a way that it also partially overlaps with z, but neither x nor z is fully contained in the other.
In this case, x and z partially overlap.

4. TPPi(x,z): 
Imagine y is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y.
x is another circle that overlaps with a part of y, and z is fully inside the overlapping region, touching the boundary of x.
In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x.

5. NTPPi(x,z): 
Similar to the above, but z is fully inside the overlapping region and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC (Disconnected)
- EC (Externally Connected)
- PO (Partially Overlapping)
- TPPi (z is a Tangential Proper Part of x)
- NTPPi (z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x)

So the correct answer is:

ANSWER:

To determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, I need to analyze the constraints given:

1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap - they share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
2. TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y - z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

- DC(x,z): Possible if x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't contain z.
- EC(x,z): Possible if x touches z at the boundary but doesn't share interior points.
- PO(x,z): Possible if x and z share some interior points but neither contains the other.
- TPP(x,z): Not possible because x partially extends outside of y (due to PO(x,y)), while z is fully within y, so x cannot be fully contained in z.
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
- TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is fully within the part of x that overlaps with y, and z touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z is fully within the part of x that overlaps with y, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because x partially overlaps with y while z is fully contained in y.
