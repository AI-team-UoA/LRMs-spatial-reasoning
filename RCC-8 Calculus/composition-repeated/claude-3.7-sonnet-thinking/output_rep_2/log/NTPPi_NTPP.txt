PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's go through what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- y is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Could x and z be disconnected (DC)? 
No, because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y, so they can't be disconnected.

2. Could x and z externally connect (EC)?
No, because they share the region y, so they can't just touch at a boundary.

3. Could x and z partially overlap (PO)?
Yes, this is possible. If x and z overlap partially, sharing the region y but each having parts that the other doesn't have.

4. Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))?
No, this would require x to be entirely contained in z and touch z's boundary. But y is inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y doesn't touch z's boundary. So if x touched z's boundary, there would be parts of x touching z's boundary that aren't y, which means x would have to extend beyond z, contradicting TPP(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this. If y is properly inside both x and z, and x is tangentially inside z, then x touches z's boundary but y doesn't touch either x or z's boundary. This seems consistent.

Actually, I think TPP(x,z) is possible. If y is properly inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y is properly inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x could be tangentially inside z (touching z's boundary).

5. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))?
Yes, this is possible. If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y is also completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x))?
Yes, this is possible. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y is also completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

7. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x))?
Yes, this is possible. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y is also completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. Could x and z be equal (EQ)?
No, this would require x = z. But we know y is properly inside both x and z, so this would mean y is properly inside itself, which is a contradiction. More explicitly, if x = z, then NTPP(y,z) = NTPP(y,x), but we're given NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x), so we would have NTPP(y,y), which is impossible because a region can't be properly inside itself.

Hmm, let me reconsider. We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

So y is properly inside both x and z. Since the interior of y must be in the interior of both x and z, the interiors of x and z must overlap. This rules out DC and EC.

Let me think more carefully about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if there are parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x, while they share the region y.

2. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if all of x is contained in z, and x touches the boundary of z.

3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if all of x is contained in z, and x does not touch the boundary of z.

4. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if all of z is contained in x, and z touches the boundary of x.

5. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if all of z is contained in x, and z does not touch the boundary of x.

6. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is not possible because y is a proper part of both x and z, so neither x nor z can be equal to y, and hence they can't be equal to each other unless y is improper part of both which contradicts our assumptions.

Actually, wait. Let me be more careful. There's a subtlety here.

If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then we have:
- NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

So y is properly inside both x and z. Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must overlap at least in the region y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch only at their boundaries. This is not possible because y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must overlap in their interiors.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if there are parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x, while they share the region y.

4. TPP(x,z): Now, I need to be careful. This means all of x is in z, and x touches z's boundary. Is this possible? If all of x is in z, and y is non-tangentially in x, then y is also in z. And y is non-tangentially in z by assumption. So TPP(x,z) is consistent with our knowledge.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means all of x is in z, and x does not touch z's boundary. Again, if all of x is in z, and y is non-tangentially in x, then y is also in z. And we know y is non-tangentially in z. So NTPP(x,z) is also consistent.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x): This means all of z is in x, and z touches x's boundary. If all of z is in x, and y is non-tangentially in z, then y is also in x. And we know y is non-tangentially in x. So TPPi(x,z) is consistent.

7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x): This means all of z is in x, and z does not touch x's boundary. If all of z is in x, and y is non-tangentially in z, then y is also in x. And we know y is non-tangentially in x. So NTPPi(x,z) is also consistent.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. Let me check if this is possible. If x and z are the same, and y is non-tangentially in x, then y is non-tangentially in z. This matches our knowledge, so EQ(x,z) is consistent.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check. 

If EQ(x,z), then x = z. We're given:
- NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

If x = z, then NTPP(y,x) = NTPP(y,z), which is consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually let's get even more precise. Let me think through each possibility again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch only at their boundaries. This is not possible because y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must overlap in their interiors.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means some of x is in z, some of x is not in z, some of z is in x, and some of z is not in x. Given that y is non-tangentially in both x and z, this is possible if y is in the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means all of x is in z, and x touches z's boundary. Given that y is non-tangentially in x, and thus non-tangentially in z, this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means all of x is in z, and x does not touch z's boundary. Given that y is non-tangentially in x, and thus non-tangentially in z, this is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is in x, and z touches x's boundary. Given that y is non-tangentially in z, and thus non-tangentially in x, this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is in x, and z does not touch x's boundary. Given that y is non-tangentially in z, and thus non-tangentially in x, this is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This means x = z. Given that y is non-tangentially in both x and z, this is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Wait. Let's be careful about the transitivity of NTPP. If y is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, it doesn't necessarily mean that x and z have a specific relationship.

Let's draw an example for each possible relationship (except DC and EC which we've ruled out) to convince myself:

3. PO(x,z): Imagine x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2, z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2, and y is a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 0.5. Then y is non-tangentially in both x and z, but x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, x is a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 1, and y is a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 0.5. Then y is non-tangentially in x, x is tangentially in z, and y is non-tangentially in z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Imagine z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 4, x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2, and y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1. Then y is non-tangentially in x, x is non-tangentially in z, and y is non-tangentially in z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, z is a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 1, and y is a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 0.5. Then y is non-tangentially in z, z is tangentially in x, and y is non-tangentially in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 4, z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2, and y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1. Then y is non-tangentially in z, z is non-tangentially in x, and y is non-tangentially in x.

8. EQ(x,z): Imagine x and z are both a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2, and y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1. Then y is non-tangentially in x, y is non-tangentially in z, and x is equal to z.

So I can indeed construct examples for all of these cases, which confirms that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Given our knowledge:
- NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

The possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let's narrow it further. I need to think more carefully about the case where x and z are equal (EQ). We know:
- NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

If x = z, then NTPP(y,x) = NTPP(y,z). This is consistent with our knowledge, so EQ(x,z) is indeed possible.

What about the case where x and z partially overlap (PO)? Is it possible for y to be non-tangentially inside both x and z if they only partially overlap? 

Yes, it's possible if y is in the overlapping region. For example, imagine x is the left half of a square, z is the right half of the square, and y is a small circle in the middle of the square (in the overlapping region). Then y is non-tangentially inside both x and z, but x and z only partially overlap.

So, again, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

So the answer is: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me interpret what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

Since y is contained in the interior of both x and z (not touching either boundary), I can rule out:
- DC(x,z): impossible because y is in both x and z, so they must share at least region y
- EC(x,z): impossible because y is in the interior of both, so they can't just touch at boundaries

For the remaining relationships:

1. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z could partially overlap, with y in their common region
2. TPP(x,z): Possible - x could be entirely within z and touch z's boundary
3. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x could be entirely within z without touching z's boundary
4. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z could be entirely within x and touch x's boundary
5. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z could be entirely within x without touching x's boundary
6. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z could be identical regions

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
