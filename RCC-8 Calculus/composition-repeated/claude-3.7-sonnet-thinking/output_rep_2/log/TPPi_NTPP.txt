PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

We're given:
1. TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x (y is contained within x), and y touches the boundary of x.
2. NTPP(y,z): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is a proper part of z (y is contained within z), but y does not touch the boundary of z. y is completely inside z.

We need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about the spatial arrangement. y is a proper part of x, and y is also a proper part of z. But the position of x relative to z is what we need to determine.

Since y is completely contained in z (NTPP relationship), and y touches the boundary of x (TPPi relationship), we can deduce that parts of x overlap with z. But the exact nature of this overlap could vary.

Let's consider different possibilities:

1. Is it possible for x to be disconnected (DC) from z? No, because y is a common region that is part of both x and z.

2. Is it possible for x to be externally connected (EC) to z? No, because y is a common region that is part of both x and z, so they must overlap, not just touch.

3. Is it possible for x to partially overlap (PO) with z? Yes, this seems valid. Since y is a proper part of both x and z, but the relationship between x and z is not fully determined, they could partially overlap.

4. Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part (TPP) of z? Yes, it's possible that x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of z? Yes, it's possible that x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part (TPPi) of x? No, I don't think this is possible. If z contains y fully (NTPP), and y touches the boundary of x (TPPi), then z must extend beyond x in some direction, which conflicts with z being a proper part of x.

7. Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part (NTPPi) of x? No, similar reasoning as above. If z contains y fully, and y touches the boundary of x, then z must extend beyond x, which conflicts with z being a proper part of x.

8. Is it possible for x to be equal (EQ) to z? No, because y is a tangential proper part of x, but a non-tangential proper part of z. If x and z were equal, y would have the same relationship with both, which is not the case.

But as I think about this more, I realize that I might have misunderstood some of the implications. Let me reconsider more carefully.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is fully contained within x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

If NTPP(y,z), then y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is fully contained within z.
- y does not touch the boundary of z; it's completely inside z.

Now, if y touches the boundary of x and y is completely inside z, what does that tell us about the relationship between x and z?

It suggests that the boundary of x that y touches is inside z, because y is completely inside z. But we still need to consider other parts of x and z.

It seems like PO, TPP, and NTPP are potential relationships between x and z. Let me double-check by visualizing examples:

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Since y is in both x and z, there's definitely overlap. But if x extends beyond z in some areas and z extends beyond x in others, they would partially overlap.

- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If the only part of x that touches the boundary of z is at the same point where y touches the boundary of x, then x would be a TPP of z.

- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If the boundary of x is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x would be an NTPP of z.

Wait, I want to re-think this. If TPPi(x,y), then actually y is a proper part of x and the boundary of y touches the boundary of x.

Let me correct myself:
If TPPi(x,y), then that means that TPP(y,x). In other words, y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is fully contained in x and y touches x's boundary.

If NTPP(y,z), then y is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, we've established:
- y is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- y is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z.

First of all, there's definitely some overlap, since y is a common region contained in both x and z. So the relations DC and EC are not possible.

Let's check the potential relationships again:

1. PO(x,z): Partial overlap. This is possible. For example, picture y as a small blob, x as a bigger blob containing y, and z as another blob containing y, with x and z both extending beyond each other in different areas.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. If x is entirely contained in z and the boundary of x (which y touches) also touches the boundary of z at some point, this relationship is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, this is possible. It means z is a much larger region that fully contains x, and there's a buffer zone between the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. But since y is in z and touches x's boundary, and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), z must extend beyond y towards x's boundary. This might be possible.

Hmm, let me think again. TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x) or that z is fully contained in x and z touches x's boundary. The question is, given that NTPP(y,z) (y is inside z, not touching z's boundary) and TPPi(x,y) (y is inside x, touching x's boundary), can z be inside x and touch x's boundary?

The fact that y touches x's boundary and y is inside z without touching z's boundary suggests that z extends beyond y in the direction of x's boundary. If z extends up to x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since y touches x's boundary and y is inside z, z must extend up to x's boundary at the point where y touches it. So, NTPPi(x,z) seems unlikely. But no, wait: y doesn't have to touch x's boundary at *every* point, just somewhere. So it's still possible that z is completely contained within x without touching the boundary of x.

6. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. As I reasoned earlier, if x and z were equal, y would have the same relationship with both, which is not the case. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the potential relationships are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and possibly NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm making this too complicated. Let me be more systematic.

First, the RCC-8 relations are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

If TPPi(x,y), then TPP(y,x). This means:
- y is a proper part of x (y is fully inside x).
- y touches the boundary of x.

If NTPP(y,z), this means:
- y is a proper part of z (y is fully inside z).
- y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, y is a common region to both x and z. So, DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are immediately ruled out, as x and z must at least partially overlap.

EQ(x,z) is ruled out, because if x and z were equal, y would have the same relationship with both, which is not the case.

Let me check the remaining possibilities:

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a part (which they do, namely y), but neither is a part of the other. Clearly this is possible, with x and z both extending beyond each other in different areas.

2. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of z. To visualize, imagine z is a big circle, x is a smaller circle inside z but touching z's boundary, and y is an even smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary. This seems possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. To visualize, imagine z is a big circle, x is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and y is an even smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary. This seems possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of x. Given what we know, let's visualize: imagine x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary at point A, and z is a region that contains y and extends to touch the boundary of x at point B. This is odd, because if z touches the boundary of x at point B, and y touches the boundary of x at point A, and y is inside z, then it seems like z contains all of y, but the boundary of y at point A is also the boundary of z, which means y would touch z's boundary. But we know from NTPP(y,z) that y does not touch z's boundary. So there's a contradiction here. I conclude that TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. I can visualize this. Imagine x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary at point A, and z is a region inside x that contains y. Since y touches x's boundary at point A, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, z must extend beyond y, away from x's boundary. If z is properly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary at any point, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I'm getting confused about the TPPi(x,z) possibility. Let me try again more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is fully inside x and z touches the boundary of x. We also know that NTPP(y,z), which means y is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, we have:
- z touches the boundary of x.
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y) or TPP(y,x)).
- y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, at the point where y touches the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x, because if it did, y would touch the boundary of z, which contradicts NTPP(y,z). But z needs to touch the boundary of x somewhere else for TPPi(x,z) to be true. It seems possible for z to touch the boundary of x at a point different from where y touches the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Now, I'm second-guessing myself on NTPPi(x,z) as well. NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is fully inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. But y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z. So, z must reach at least to the point where y touches the boundary of x, which means z would touch the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z). But wait, I think I'm confusing myself. Just because y is inside z doesn't mean z includes the point where y touches the boundary of x. That point is on the boundary of both x and y. z surrounds y completely, except at the boundary point, which is not strictly inside y and thus not necessarily inside z. So z does not necessarily touch the boundary of x, and NTPPi is possible.

Let's quickly revise, using clearer reasoning, focusing only on the possibilities I think are plausible.

1. PO(x,z): x and z share a part (y), but neither is a proper part of the other. This is possible. For example, picture y as a small circle, x as a bigger circle containing y, and z as another circle containing y, with x and z both extending beyond each other in different areas. We can arrange this so that y touches the boundary of x and is completely inside z.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of z. This is possible. Image: z is a big circle, x is a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and y is an even smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary at a different point.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. This is possible. Image: z is a big circle, x is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and y is an even smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of x. This needs careful thought. We know y is inside both x and z. y touches the boundary of x. y doesn't touch the boundary of z. It's a bit unclear how z could touch the boundary of x at a point different from where y touches it. I don't have a clear picture.

Let me try to visualize TPPi(x,z) more carefully. We need scenarios where:
- y touches the boundary of x at a point A.
- y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- z is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x.

Let's see. If y is fully inside z, and y touches the boundary of x at point A, then z must at least reach the boundary of x at point A. But at that point A, y would touch not only the boundary of x but also the boundary of z, contradicting the statement that y doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, TPPi(x,z) seems implausible.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the properties of boundaries in this context. If y touches the boundary of x at point A, it means point A is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x. This doesn't mean y includes the boundary; it just means they touch.

So, if y touches the boundary of x at point A, and y is inside z, does that mean z includes the boundary of y at point A? If z includes the boundary of y at point A, then z would touch the boundary of x at point A, making TPPi(x,z) possible. But if z includes the boundary of y at point A, then y would touch the boundary of z at point A, which contradicts NTPP(y,z).

I think the key insight here is to understand what it means for y to be "inside" z. If y's boundary is part of z's boundary at point A, then y touches the boundary of z at point A, which contradicts NTPP(y,z). So, in the context of NTPP(y,z), y is truly inside z, with no part of y touching the boundary of z. But if that's the case, and y touches the boundary of x at point A, then z must extend at least a tiny bit beyond y in the direction of the boundary of x at point A. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of x at point A, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the plausible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm misunderstanding a key thing again about these boundary relationships. Let me go back to the original definitions: 

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. y is fully inside x and y touches the boundary of x. We can think of it like y touches the boundary of x from the inside.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. x is fully inside z and x touches the boundary of z. x touches the boundary of z from the inside.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. y is fully inside z and y doesn't touch the boundary of z. There's a buffer zone between y and the boundary of z.

So, the scenarios we have are:
- y is fully inside x and y touches the boundary of x from the inside.
- y is fully inside z and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If y is fully inside z and fully inside x, then there's overlap between z and x. If y touches the boundary of x from the inside, then even if z surrounds y, it may not entend all the way to the boundary of x. That would create a situation where z is not a proper part of x, but rather z and x overlap.

I'll keep refining my reasoning. I believe the possible relationships are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, with y being in the overlap region. This is possible. For example, imagine a scenario where:
   - x is a circle.
   - y is a smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at a single point.
   - z is a circle containing y, but not containing all of x, and x doesn't contain all of z. z is positioned such that y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. Imagine:
   - z is a large circle.
   - x is a smaller circle inside z, touching the boundary of z at a single point.
   - y is an even smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point different from where x touches the boundary of z.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. Imagine:
   - z is a large circle.
   - x is a smaller circle completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z.
   - y is an even smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is fully inside x and z touches the boundary of x.

   Let me think about this step by step. We have:
   - y touches the boundary of x at a point A.
   - y is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - We want to determine if z can touch the boundary of x.

   If y touches the boundary of x at point A, and y is fully inside z, then z must at least reach up to the boundary of x at point A. But if z touches the boundary of x at point A, and y also touches the boundary of x at point A, then y would touch the boundary of z at point A, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

   I need to be very careful here. Touching the boundary means being connected to but not sharing any interior parts. So, if y touches the boundary of x at point A, it means point A is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x. That doesn't mean y includes the boundary of x; it just means they touch at the boundary.
   
   But wait, if point A is on the boundary of y, and y is fully inside z, then point A is part of z (since z contains y). And if point A is on the boundary of x, and point A is part of z, then z touches the boundary of x at point A. This would make TPPi(x,z) possible. However, then point A would also be on the boundary of y and part of z. Since y is fully inside z without touching the boundary of z, point A can't be on the boundary of z. But if point A is not on the boundary of z, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x at point A.

   This is confusing... I think the error is in how I'm thinking about regions. In region-based qualitative spatial reasoning, regions are typically imagined as open sets. A region x is fully inside region y if the closure of x is a subset of the interior of y. When y touches the boundary of x, it means there's a point that's on both the closure of y and the boundary of x, but y's interior doesn't intersect x's boundary.

   Given that, the issues is this: if y touches the boundary of x at point A, and y is non-tangentially inside z, then the boundary point A is not within the interior of z. But for z to touch the boundary of x at point A, the point A must be within the closure of z. This creates a contradiction with NTPP(y,z), which implies y's closure is in the interior of z. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is fully inside x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

   Let's think step by step. We have:
   - y touches the boundary of x at a point A.
   - y is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - We want to determine if z can be fully inside x without touching the boundary of x.

   Since y touches the boundary of x at point A, and y is fully inside z, for z to not touch the boundary of x, it must not include the boundary point A or any other boundary point of x. But if y touches the boundary of x at point A, and y is fully inside z, then z must at least include point A, which would make z touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

   Hmm, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me clarify: Touching the boundary means there's a point of connection but no overlap in the interiors. Overlapping objects share a space that belongs to both.

OK let me handle this completely differently. I need to reason about this using the constraints directly. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then it is completely within x, touching the boundary of x. If y is also a non-tangential proper part of z, then it is completely within z, not touching the boundary of z. So we have a region y that is inside both x and z, and touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. Let me draw some pictures.

Imagine we have x as a circle, and y as a smaller circle inside it, touching the boundary of x at a point. Now, z must completely include y, and y cannot touch the boundary of z. So z has to be a "buffer" around y, where this buffer is sufficiently thick so that y doesn't touch the boundary of z. But this buffer is going to be thin near where y touches the boundary of x. So if y gets pushed all the way to the boundary of x (which it is, since TPPi(x,y)), then the buffer z has to cover y in that direction too. So the boundary of z has to go beyond the boundary of x. Otherwise, if you try to draw the boundary of z on or inside the boundary of x, then there will be a point where y touches the boundary of z. So z cannot be fully inside x, which rules out NTPPi(x,z) and TPPi(x,z). So z must extend beyond the boundary of x, at least at the point where y touches the boundary of x.

At the same time, we know y is in the overlap of x and z. This means x and z could partially overlap (PO), or x could be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP). Let me reconsider each of these.

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, with y in the overlap region. This is possible. We draw y inside both x and z, with y touching the boundary of x, but not the boundary of z. z extends beyond the boundary of x so that y doesn't touch the boundary of z. And x extends beyond the boundary of z in another direction.

- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. We draw x completely within z, touching the boundary of z. y is inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point. This point is inside z but away from the boundary of z, so y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x is completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z. y is inside x, touching the boundary of x. Since x doesn't touch the boundary of z, y also doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check by using the composition table from the RCC-8 calculus.

The composition table for the RCC-8 calculus gives what the possible relations between x and z could be if we know the RCC-8 relation between x and y, and also between y and z. In our case, we we know TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

I realize I've been referring to the wrong direction in my definitions above. TPPi(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, inverted. It's the inverse of TPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,y) actually means TPP(y,x), which is what I've been using.

Let's look at the composition table entry for TPPi(x,y) ∘ NTPP(y,z). According to the RCC-8 composition table, the possible relations are:
TPPi(x,y) ∘ NTPP(y,z) = {PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)}

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is:
Partial Overlap (PO), Tangential Proper Part (TPP), and Non-tangential Proper Part (NTPP).

Actually, I just remembered that in RCC-8, TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. And NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So I was using the correct definitions above, not the wrong direction. I'm not sure where I got confused.

In summary: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me understand what these constraints tell us:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained within x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

From these constraints, I can deduce:
1. Since y is part of both x and z, there must be some overlap between x and z, so DC and EC are ruled out.
2. Since y touches the boundary of x but doesn't touch the boundary of z, z must extend beyond x at the point where y touches x's boundary.
3. The relationship can't be EQ(x,z) because y has different relationships with x and z.
4. TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because z must extend beyond x's boundary.

The only possible relationships remaining are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP
