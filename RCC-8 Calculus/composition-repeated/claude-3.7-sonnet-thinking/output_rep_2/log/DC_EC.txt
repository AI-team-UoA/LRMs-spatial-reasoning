PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

We're given that:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries)

And we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

DC(x,y) means that x and y have no spatial overlap and don't even touch at their boundaries. They are completely separate.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Now, let's think about what this means for the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. If x is disconnected from y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x could be completely disconnected from z as well.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, x could touch z at their boundaries, especially if z extends beyond y in some direction.

3. PO(x,z): Partial overlap is possible. Even though x doesn't overlap with y, it could partially overlap with z, especially in regions where z extends away from y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems possible if x is located in a part of z that is completely separate from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part. This is also possible if x is contained entirely within z, away from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. I need to think more about this. If z is a part of x, and y touches z, then y would also touch x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me re-examine this. If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y touches z at the boundary, y could touch z at a part of z's boundary that coincides with x's boundary. But if y touches x's boundary, then it would be EC(x,y), not DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is contained entirely within x (away from x's boundary), and y touches z at its boundary, then y would also touch x's interior, which would make it more than just DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. If z is a part of x (whether tangential or non-tangential), and y touches z, then y also touches or overlaps with x. This contradicts DC(x,y). So, both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y touches z at the boundary, then y would also touch x at the boundary, making it EC(x,y) instead of DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Wait, I need to think about this more carefully. Let's double-check each possibility more rigorously:

1. DC(x,z): If x and y are disconnected (DC(x,y)) and y and z touch at the boundary (EC(y,z)), then x and z can definitely be disconnected. For instance, imagine z as a circle, y as another circle touching z from the outside, and x as a third circle that is separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): This also seems possible. Imagine z as a circle, y as another circle touching z from the outside, and x as a third circle that touches z from another side but is still disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z): This also seems possible. Imagine z as a large circle, y as a small circle touching z from the outside, and x as another circle that partially overlaps with z but doesn't touch y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside z and touches its boundary, and y is outside z but touches z's boundary, then x and y would be disconnected. So, this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is deeply inside z, and y touches z from the outside, then x and y would definitely be disconnected. So, this is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary from the outside, then y would also touch x's boundary from the outside (since the part of z's boundary that y touches would also be a part of x's boundary). This would make it EC(x,y), not DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary from the outside, then y would also touch x's interior (since z's boundary is inside x). This would make it more than just DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, and y touches z's boundary, then y would also touch x's boundary, making it EC(x,y) instead of DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Hmm, hold on. Let's think about this from another angle.

If TPPi(x,z) is true, this means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and EC(y,z) is true, meaning y touches z's boundary, then y would touch z at a part of z's boundary that is also a part of x's boundary. This would make it EC(x,y) and not DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, if NTPPi(x,z) is true, this means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and EC(y,z) is true, meaning y touches z's boundary, then y would touch x's interior (because z's boundary is inside x). This would make it more than just DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

And if EQ(x,z) is true, this means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and EC(y,z) is true, meaning y touches z's boundary, then y would also touch x's boundary, making it EC(x,y) and not DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me think about the remaining options one more time:

1. DC(x,z): If x and y are disconnected (DC(x,y)) and y and z touch at the boundary (EC(y,z)), then x and z can definitely be disconnected. Imagine z as a circle, y as another circle touching z from the outside, and x as a third circle that is separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. Imagine z as a circle, y as another circle touching z from the outside, and x as a third circle that touches z from another side but is still disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z): This is also possible. Imagine z as a large circle, y as a small circle touching z from the outside, and x as another circle that partially overlaps with z but doesn't touch y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside z and touches its boundary on a side opposite to where y touches z, then x and y would be disconnected. So, this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is deeply inside z, and y touches z from the outside, then x and y would definitely be disconnected. So, this is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I think we should double-check TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z (meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary), and y touches z's boundary from the outside, then it's possible for y to touch z at a point that's far away from where x touches z's boundary. In such a case, x and y would be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z (meaning x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary), and y touches z's boundary from the outside, then x and y would definitely be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

So my final list of possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's verify this against the constraints one more time, with concrete examples where possible.

For all these examples, we need to maintain: DC(x,y) and EC(y,z). This means x and y are disconnected, and y and z are externally connected.

Example of DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) and DC(x,z):
- z is a circle on the left
- y is a circle touching z from the right
- x is a circle to the right of y, without touching y or z
In this scenario, x and z are disconnected (DC).

Example of DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) and EC(x,z):
- z is a circle in the center
- y is a circle touching z from the right
- x is a circle touching z from the left, without touching y
In this scenario, x and z are externally connected (EC).

Example of DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) and PO(x,z):
- z is a large circle
- y is a small circle touching z from the outside on the right
- x is a circle that overlaps with a portion of z on the left, but doesn't touch or overlap with y
In this scenario, x and z partially overlap (PO).

Example of DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) and TPP(x,z):
- z is a large circle
- y is a small circle touching z from the outside on the right
- x is a circle inside z, touching z's boundary on the left, but far from y
In this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP).

Example of DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) and NTPP(x,z):
- z is a large circle
- y is a small circle touching z from the outside
- x is a small circle inside z, but not touching z's boundary
In this scenario, x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).

All these examples confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

We've also confirmed that the other RCC-8 relations (TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ) are not possible because they contradict the given constraints.

Final answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations could possibly hold between x and z, given that DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no shared parts, no touching)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x could be completely separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x could touch z's boundary at a different location than where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x could partially overlap with z while remaining completely disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be inside z, touching z's boundary, while y touches z at a different boundary point.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) while y touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a tangential proper part of x, then y touching z would mean y also touches x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were contained inside x, then y touching z would mean y touches x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, and y touches z, then y would touch x, contradicting DC(x,y).
