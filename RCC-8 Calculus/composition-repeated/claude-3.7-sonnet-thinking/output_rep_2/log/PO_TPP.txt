PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think carefully about these relations.

Given that PO(x,y) means that x and y share some spatial part, but neither is completely a part of the other.

And TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's consider each of the 8 RCC-8 relations one at a time:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Well, we know that x shares some part with y, and y is completely contained in z. This means that at least that shared part of x and y must also be in z, which means x and z must share at least that part. So x and z cannot be disconnected. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected (i.e., touching but not overlapping)? We know that x and y overlap, and y is completely contained in z. That means at least part of x is inside z, which means x and z overlap. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? This seems possible. If x partially overlaps with y, and y is inside z, then x could overlap with z. But x might not be completely contained in z, as x might extend outside of z as well. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This is possible if x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Since y touches z's boundary and x partially overlaps with y, x could touch z's boundary at the same point as y. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is completely inside z but does not touch z's boundary. This can happen if the overlap between x and y is such that x is completely inside z but doesn't reach to z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean that z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since y is inside z, and x overlaps with y, x would have to be much larger than z to completely contain it. But given that y touches z's boundary and x partially overlaps with y, it's not clear that z can be completely inside x. Let me think more about this.

Actually, if z is a proper part of x, then every part of z is a part of x. However, we know that y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y, meaning that there are parts of y that are not parts of x. But this contradicts the assumption that z is a proper part of x, because if z were a proper part of x, then all parts of y would also be parts of x (since y is a part of z). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this would mean z is completely contained in x but doesn't touch x's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPPi, if z is a proper part of x, then all of z, and thus all of y, would have to be parts of x. But we're given that x only partially overlaps with y, so this is not possible. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? If they were, then x would contain all of y. But since x only partially overlaps with y, there are parts of y that are not part of x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), since I want to make sure I'm getting this right.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. We know that y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's go back to basics. PO(x,y) means that x and y have some spatial part in common, but neither is part of the other. TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, we need z to be a proper part of x. But if z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, we need z to be a proper part of x. By the same reasoning as above, this contradicts PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me double-check this reasoning. We have PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Hmm, actually I may have made a mistake earlier. Let me think more about TPPi(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, we need z to be a proper part of x. If z is a proper part of x, then all of z is contained in x.

We know that y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is contained in z and touches z's boundary. We also know that x partially overlaps with y, meaning that x and y share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

So if z is a proper part of x, then all of z, including y, would be inside x. But we're told that x and y only partially overlap. 

Actually, no, there's a subtle but important distinction here. PO(x,y) means that x and y have some parts in common, but each also has parts that are not shared. It doesn't mean that the entirety of either object has to be partially inside the other.

Let me try to draw this out. Suppose we have:

```
     z
    ___
   |   |
   | y |
   |___|
```

And then x could be:

```
     z
    ___
   |   |
   | y |
   |_|_|
     | |
     |_|
      x
```

In this case, x and y partially overlap, y is a tangential proper part of z, but x is not a part of z, nor is z a part of x. So PO(x,z) seems to be the relation here.

But what if x looks like:

```
     z
    ___
   |   |
   | y |
 __|___|__
|  |   |  |
|  |___|  |
|          |
|__________|
      x
```

In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x.

Wait, I think I'm still making a mistake. Let me re-check the definitions carefully:

- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a part of z and touches z's boundary.

So if we have:

```
     z
    ___
   |   |
   | y |
   |___|
```

And x is:

```
     z
    ___
   |   |
  _|_y_|_
 |  |   | |
 |  |___| |
 |        |
 |________|
      x
```

Then PO(x,y) is true because x and y share a part but neither is a part of the other. TPP(y,z) is true because y is a part of z and touches z's boundary.

And what's the relation between x and z? In this case, it seems that TPPi(x,z) is true because z is a part of x and touches x's boundary.

Wait, no, in this case, z is not a part of x. Let's try again with a different diagram.

Suppose we have:

```
     z
    ___
   |   |
   | y |
   |___|
```

And x is:

```
      x
    _____
   |     |
   |  ___|___
   | |   |   |
   | | y |   |
   | |___|   |
   |         |
   |_________|
         z
```

Here, PO(x,y) is true because x and y share a part but neither is a part of the other. TPP(y,z) is true because y is a part of z and touches z's boundary.

And what's the relation between x and z? It seems that PO(x,z) is true because x and z share a part but neither is a part of the other.

Let me try to clarify the situation by reasoning about the different regions involved.

Since PO(x,y), there are three regions to consider: x∩y (the overlap of x and y), x-y (the part of x not in y), and y-x (the part of y not in x).

Since TPP(y,z), we know that all of y is in z, and y touches z's boundary. This means that both x∩y and y-x are in z.

Now let's consider the relationship between x and z. We have the following regions: x∩z, x-z, and z-x.

We know that x∩y is a subset of x∩z because all of y is in z. We also know that x-y may or may not overlap with z-y, so it's not clear whether x-z is empty or not.

If x-z is not empty, then the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

But we also need to consider the case where x-z is empty, which would mean that all of x is inside z. In this case, the relationship could be either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z), depending on whether x touches z's boundary.

So the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But wait, what about the case where z is inside x? If z is entirely inside x, and given that y is inside z and x overlaps with y, then the relationship could be TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Let me think about this more carefully.

If PO(x, y) and TPP(y, z), then y is a proper part of z, and y touches z's boundary. And x partially overlaps with y, meaning that they share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

Let's again consider the relationship between x and z.

PO(x, z) would mean that x and z have a common part but neither is a part of the other. We know that x and y share a part, and all of y is in z, so x and z definitely share a part. If x extends outside of z, then PO(x, z) is the relationship.

TPP(x, z) would mean that x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x, z) is the relationship.

NTPP(x, z) would mean that x is a proper part of z but does not touch z's boundary. If all of x is inside z, and x does not touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x, z) is the relationship.

TPPi(x, z) would mean that z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. For this to be true, all of z must be inside x. But we know that y is inside z, and x only partially overlaps with y. This seems to be a contradiction, because if all of z is inside x, and all of y is inside z, then all of y must be inside x, contradicting PO(x, y). So TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x, z) would mean that z is a proper part of x but does not touch x's boundary. By similar reasoning as for TPPi(x, z), this would contradict PO(x, y). So NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Hmm, I'm still not 100% satisfied with my reasoning about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me re-check.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's see... If z is a proper part of x, then all of z is inside x. Since y is a part of z, all of y is also inside x. But we're given that PO(x,y), which means that not all of y is inside x. This is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), all of z would be inside x, so all of y would be inside x, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So we have only three possible relationships between x and z: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I may have been misunderstanding the definition of PO(x,y). Let me double-check.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Specifically, there's at least one point that is both in x and in y, but there's at least one point in x that's not in y, and there's at least one point in y that's not in x.

So, if we have PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we know:
- x and y overlap, but neither is a part of the other.
- All of y is in z, and y touches z's boundary.

Now, for TPPi(x,z) to be true, all of z would have to be in x. Since y is in z, all of y would be in x. But we're given that PO(x,y), which means that not all of y is in x. This is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), all of z would be in x, so all of y would be in x, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's double-check each of these.

PO(x,z): This would mean that x and z share a part, but neither is a part of the other. Since y is in z and x overlaps with y, x and z definitely share a part. If x extends outside of z, then neither is a part of the other, so PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): This would mean that all of x is in z, and x touches z's boundary. Given that y is in z and touches z's boundary, and x overlaps with y, it's possible that all of x is in z and x touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): This would mean that all of x is in z, but x does not touch z's boundary. Since y is in z and x overlaps with y, it's possible that all of x is in z. If x is small enough that it doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me draw some diagrams to make sure I understand the problem correctly.

First, let's establish a clear understanding of PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z):

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Visually, this could be:

```
    ______      ______
   |      |    |      |
   |  x   |____|  y   |
   |______|    |______|
```

TPP(y,z) means that y is a part of z and touches z's boundary. Visually, this could be:

```
        _____________
       |             |
       |      z      |
       |   ______    |
       |  |      |   |
       |  |  y   |   |
       |  |______|   |
       |_____________|
```

Now, let's combine these. We have:

```
        _____________
       |             |
       |      z      |
       |   ______    |
   ____|__|      |   |
  |    |  |  y   |   |
  | x  |__|______|   |
  |____|             |
       |_____________|
```

In this case, the relationship between x and z would be PO(x,z), because x and z share a part, but neither is a part of the other.

But x could also be entirely inside z:

```
        _____________
       |             |
       |      z      |
       |   ______    |
       |  |      |   |
   ____|__|  y   |   |
  |    |  |______|   |
  | x  |             |
  |____|_____________|
```

In this case, the relationship between x and z would be TPP(x,z), because all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary.

Or x could be entirely inside z but not touching its boundary:

```
        _____________
       |             |
       |      z      |
       |   ______    |
       |  |      |   |
       |  |  y   |   |
       |  |______|   |
       |   ____      |
       |  |    |     |
       |  | x  |     |
       |  |____|     |
       |_____________|
```

In this case, the relationship between x and z would be NTPP(x,z), because all of x is inside z, but x does not touch z's boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's just double-check our reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) to be sure.

For TPPi(x,z), z would have to be a proper part of x, touching x's boundary. Let's try to draw this:

```
   ________________
  |                |
  |     x          |
  |    ________    |
  |   |        |   |
  |   |   z    |   |
  |   |  ____  |   |
  |   | |    | |   |
  |   | | y  | |   |
  |   | |____| |   |
  |   |________|   |
  |________________|
```

But this contradicts our given PO(x,y), because in this diagram, all of y is inside x, but PO(x,y) requires that some part of y is not in x.

Similarly for NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x not touching x's boundary, which would still mean all of y is inside x, contradicting PO(x,y).

So we've confirmed that the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just make sure I have the definition of PO(x,y) correct. The given definition is: PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Wait, actually, I want to double-check. If y is a proper part of z, and x shares a part with y but is not a part of y, could x be large enough that z is a proper part of x?

Let me try to construct such a situation.

Suppose x is like this:

```
   __________________
  |                  |
  |        x         |
  |   ____________   |
  |  |            |  |
  |  |     z      |  |
  |  |   ______   |  |
  |  |  |      |  |  |
  |  |  |  y   |  |  |
  |  |  |______|  |  |
  |  |____________|  |
  |__________________|
```

Here, z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z. But if x is to partially overlap with y, not all of y should be in x. This contradicts the diagram, so such a configuration is not possible.

I think the issue is that if y is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x, then y must be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

So we've verified that the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me review carefully one more time.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This means that x∩y ≠ ∅, x\y ≠ ∅, and y\x ≠ ∅.
- TPP(y,z): y is a part of z and touches z's boundary. This means that y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, I want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's consider what we can say about x∩z. Since y ⊂ z, we know that x∩y ⊂ x∩z. Since x∩y ≠ ∅ (from PO(x,y)), we can say that x∩z ≠ ∅. So x and z must share a part.

This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), which both require that x and z have no common interior. 

Now, let's consider the possible relationships:

1. PO(x,z): x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. This requires that x\z ≠ ∅ and z\x ≠ ∅. We know that y\x ≠ ∅ (from PO(x,y)), and y ⊂ z, so y\x ⊂ z, which means z\x ≠ ∅. If x also extends outside of z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x touches z's boundary. This means that x ⊂ z and x touches the boundary of z. From PO(x,y), we know that x and y share a part but neither is a part of the other. Nothing in these constraints prevents x from being a proper part of z, provided x touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch z's boundary. Like with TPP(x,z), there's nothing in our constraints that prevents this, provided x doesn't touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z touches x's boundary. This means that z ⊂ x and z touches the boundary of x. But if z ⊂ x, and y ⊂ z, then y ⊂ x. This contradicts PO(x,y), which states that neither x nor y is a part of the other. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch x's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPPi(x,z), this would contradict PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. EQ(x,z): x is equal to z. If x = z, and y is a proper part of z, then y would be a proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me double-check my reasoning for EQ(x,z). If x = z, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then y would be a tangential proper part of x. This would mean that y is a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y), which states that neither x nor y is a part of the other.

So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Now, let's double-check our reasoning for DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

DC(x,z) would mean that x and z have no common part. But we've established that x∩z ≠ ∅, because x∩y ≠ ∅ and y ⊂ z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but have no common interior. But again, we've established that x∩z ≠ ∅ in the interior. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's finally review our answer one more time:

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a part of z and touches z's boundary.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): if x extends outside of z.
- TPP(x,z): if all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): if all of x is inside z, and x does not touch z's boundary.

So the answer is:
### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z, given that:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is part of z, x must share at least that overlapping region with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. As above, x and z must share interior points, not just boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x partially extends outside of z, they would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were part of x, then y would be completely part of x (since y is part of z), which contradicts PO(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be a proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
