PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

2. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary

Now, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must also be inside x (by transitivity of containment). But the question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y does not touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. This is because if z were to touch the boundary of x, it would mean there is a point of z that is on the boundary of x. But since all of y (including its boundary) is strictly inside x, and z only touches the boundary of y, z cannot reach the boundary of x.

Therefore, z must be completely inside x without touching its boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:
- If z touched the boundary of x, it would mean the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x, which contradicts the given NTPPi(x,y).
- So z must be fully inside x, and since it doesn't touch the boundary of x, we have NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I need to reconsider this. The fact that z touches the boundary of y doesn't necessarily tell us exactly where z is in relation to x.

Let's think about it differently. We know:
- y is properly inside x (NTPPi(x,y) → NTPP(y,x))
- z is tangentially inside y (TPPi(y,z) → TPP(z,y))

From these, we can deduce:
- Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, z must be inside x.
- The question is: does z touch the boundary of x?

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), z cannot touch the boundary of x. This is because the boundary of y is strictly inside x, and z only reaches as far as the boundary of y.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, wait. I'm making some unjustified leaps here. Let me be more systematic.

Let me reason with the actual definitions:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y does not share any part with the boundary of x.

2. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and z shares at least one point with the boundary of y.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is a proper part of y (from TPP(z,y)), and y is a proper part of x (from NTPP(y,x)), by transitivity, z is a proper part of x.

But is z tangential or non-tangential to x? That depends on whether z touches the boundary of x.

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), z cannot touch the boundary of x. This is because the boundary of y is inside x, not on the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, let me triple-check that z can't possibly touch the boundary of x. 

Given:
- y is strictly inside x (no part of y touches the boundary of x)
- z touches the boundary of y

If z were to touch the boundary of x, there would be a point p such that p is in both z and the boundary of x. But z is inside y, and y is strictly inside x, so all points of z are strictly inside x. This means no point of z can be on the boundary of x.

Therefore, z must be strictly inside x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I realize I need to consider another aspect of these relations. RCC-8 considers regions that may have "holes" or be disconnected. But I think the reasoning still holds.

If y is strictly inside x (NTPP(y,x)), then the boundary of y cannot intersect with the boundary of x. And if z touches the boundary of y (TPP(z,y)), then z is still confined to be within y and can't reach the boundary of x.

So, I believe the correct answer is: if NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,x)).

But actually, let me be even more careful. Let's consider the RCC-8 composition table. For NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the result should be the composition of NTPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y). 

Actually, let me double check my understanding of RCC-8 again. Let's see each relation:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (disjoint).
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch but don't overlap).
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Ok, so my prior reasoning is correct:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So now let's carefully reason about the possible relationships between x and z:

First, it's clear that z is a proper part of x, because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x. So the possible relationships are TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x) (equivalently, TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)).

To determine which one, we need to know if z touches the boundary of x. Given that z touches the boundary of y (because TPP(z,y)), and y is strictly inside x without touching its boundary (because NTPP(y,x)), we can conclude that z cannot touch the boundary of x. This is because the boundary of y is strictly inside x, and z can only reach the boundary of y.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, to answer the original question, if NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider this more carefully. I think I'm being too restrictive. 

We have:
1. NTPPi(x,y) → NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) → TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

We can visualize y as being completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z as being inside y and touching y's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is not possible because z is inside y, which is inside x, so z must be inside x.
2. EC(x,z): This is not possible for the same reason; z cannot touch the boundary of x without overlapping with x.
3. PO(x,z): This is not possible because z is completely inside x, not just partially.
4. TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But given that z is inside y and y is strictly inside x (not touching the boundary of x), z cannot touch the boundary of x. So this is not possible.
5. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z is inside y, and y is strictly inside x, z must be strictly inside x. This is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): This means z contains x tangentially. But z is inside y, which is inside x, so z cannot contain x. This is not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z contains x non-tangentially. This is also not possible for the same reason.
8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But z is inside y, which is inside x, so z cannot be equal to x. This is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, if NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's double check that this is the only possible relation.  

As a sanity check, I'm going to trace through this with prototypical examples.

Let x be a big circle, y be a smaller circle inside x but not touching the boundary, and z be a smaller circle inside y and touching y's boundary.

Is it possible in this case for z to touch the boundary of x? No, because y, including its boundary, is strictly inside x, so z can only extend as far as the boundary of y, which is still inside x.

So, z is strictly inside x, which means NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Let's see if I can find a counter-example. Can z be in any other relationship with x?

Let's try to make z be TPP to x. That would mean z touches the boundary of x. But we know z is inside y, and y is strictly inside x. So z can't touch the boundary of x.

Let's try to make z be PO with x. That would mean z partially overlaps with x. But if z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, then z must be completely inside x. So z can't be PO to x.

I think I've confirmed that the only possible relation is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized I wasn't being careful enough about what "tangential" and "non-tangential" mean. Let me look up the definitions:

In RCC-8, "tangential proper part" (TPP) means that one region is a proper part of another region, and they share at least one point on their boundaries. "Non-tangential proper part" (NTPP) means that one region is a proper part of another region, and they do not share any points on their boundaries.

So, let's revisit:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x, and the boundary of y does not touch the boundary of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y.

Now, where is z in relation to x? We know z is inside y, and y is inside x. So z is inside x. But does the boundary of z touch the boundary of x? Given that y, including its boundary, is completely inside x (not touching the boundary of x), and z is inside y with its boundary touching the boundary of y, the boundary of z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, my answer remains the same: if NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I'm overthinking this. The whole issue comes down to just a question of transitivity of these part-of relations.

We have:
1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

The transitivity rule would tell us that if y is a proper part of x, and z is a proper part of y, then z is a proper part of x. But the question is whether z is a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x.

The key lies in understanding where the boundary of z is in relation to the boundary of x. Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y is strictly inside x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer remains the same: if NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let's triple check with a specific example:

- Let x be the set of points in the Euclidean plane with distance < 3 from the origin.
- Let y be the set of points with distance < 2 from the origin.
- Let z be the set of points with distance ≤ 1 from the origin.

Then:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(y,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,y)).
- z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y) or equivalently, TPPi(y,z)).

Now, what is the relationship between x and z? Clearly, z is a proper part of x. But is it tangential or non-tangential? The boundary of z is the circle of radius 1, and the boundary of x is the circle of radius 3. These boundaries don't intersect, so z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

This confirms my reasoning. If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize I could have been more systematic by using a composition table for RCC-8. The composition of NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) would give the possible relations between x and z. Looking at composition tables for RCC-8, I find that the composition of NTPP(y,x) (which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,y)) and TPP(z,y) (which is equivalent to TPPi(y,z)) is indeed NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is: if NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I should do a deeper literature review. Let me consult the RCC-8 composition table:

The composition of NTPPi and TPPi gives:

Since NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), and TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), we're looking for the composition of NTPP and TPP in the reverse order.

Let's visualize this.
- NTPP(y,x) means y is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.
- TPP(z,y) means z is inside y, touching the boundary of y.

When composing these in order from z to y to x, we get:
- z is inside y, touching the boundary of y.
- y is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.

Putting these together, z is inside x and cannot touch the boundary of x, since it can at most touch the boundary of y, which is strictly inside x. 

So the relation is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify this with a direct check of the RCC-8 composition table. Specifically, I am trying to compute what I would find from the row of NTPPi and the column of TPPi. 

According to the RCC-8 composition table (which I am drawing from memory based on my knowledge of qualitative spatial reasoning), we should have:

NTPPi ∘ TPPi = NTPPi

Hmm, but this doesn't seem quite right. Let me think about this in terms of inverses. 

The inverse of NTPPi is NTPP, and the inverse of TPPi is TPP. So:
NTPPi(x,y) ∘ TPPi(y,z) = NTPPi(x,z) if and only if NTPP(z,x) = NTPP(y,x) ∘ TPP(z,y)

The composition of NTPP and TPP is NTPP, because when you go from something that is NTPP to another thing via TPP, you certainly can't touch the boundary of the first thing.

So, yes, the relation is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident now: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me clarify once more since I'm hedging a bit.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

From these, we can deduce that z is inside x. But to determine the exact relation, we need to know if z touches the boundary of x.

Given that y is strictly inside x, and z is inside y touching y's boundary, z can only touch the boundary of y, not the boundary of x. Therefore, z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

Now, to find the relation between x and z:

Since z is inside y (from TPP(z,y)), and y is inside x (from NTPP(y,x)), z must be inside x.

The question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not. Since y doesn't touch the boundary of x (it's non-tangential), and z only reaches as far as the boundary of y, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
