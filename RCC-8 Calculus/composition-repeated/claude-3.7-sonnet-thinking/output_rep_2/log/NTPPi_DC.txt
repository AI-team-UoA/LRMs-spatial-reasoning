PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Okay, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between regions x and z given that:
1. NTPPi(x,y) - which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. DC(y,z) - which means that y and z are disconnected, i.e., they don't share any points and don't touch.

Let me think through this carefully:

Since y is completely inside x (with a gap between y and x's boundary), and z is completely separated from y, there are multiple possibilities for how x and z could relate:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected (touching at their boundaries).
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap.
4. TPP(z,x): z could be a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).
5. NTPP(z,x): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary).
6. EQ(x,z): This can't be true because if x equals z, then z would have to contain y (since x contains y), contradicting DC(y,z).
7. TPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z contains x and their boundaries touch.
8. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. This is possible.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning for 6, 7, and 8:

For 6 (EQ): If x equals z, then y would have to relate to z the same way it relates to x. But we know NTPPi(x,y), meaning y is completely inside x. This contradicts DC(y,z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

For 7 (TPPi): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary (due to NTPPi(x,y)), y would also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This contradicts DC(y,z), so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For 8 (NTPPi): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, since y is completely inside x, y would also be completely inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider my analysis for 4 and 5 as well:

For 4 (TPP): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), and z is disconnected from y (DC(y,z)), this scenario is possible.

For 5 (NTPP): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This would place z in a similar position to y within x. Since y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), this scenario is also possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(z,x)
5. NTPP(z,x)

Actually, now I'm unsure about my analysis for 4 and 5. Let me reconsider:

Given NTPPi(x,y), y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points and don't touch.

For 4 (TPP(z,x)): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This means z and y are both parts of x, but they don't overlap (due to DC(y,z)). This is possible.

For 5 (NTPP(z,x)): Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y and z don't overlap, this is also possible.

Let me verify my overall conclusion once more:

The possible relationships between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(z,x)
5. NTPP(z,x)

Actually, let me check myself. I need to be more specific when I'm considering whether region z relates to region x in a particular way.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. The 'i' indicates the inverse relation, so in this case, it means y is completely enclosed within x without touching x's boundary. 

DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected - they don't share any parts and don't touch.

Let's go through all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   For this to be true, x and z must not share any parts and not touch. Given that y is inside x, and z is disconnected from y, it's still possible for x and z to be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect.
   For this to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior parts. Given that y is inside x, and z is disconnected from y, it's still possible for x and z to touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   For this to be true, x and z must share some interior parts, but neither is contained within the other. Given that y is inside x, and z is disconnected from y, z could partially overlap with x as long as the overlapping region doesn't include y. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. If x is inside z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. But this contradicts DC(y,z), which states that y and z are disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to the reasoning for TPP, if x is inside z, then y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given that y is inside x, and z is disconnected from y, this scenario is possible as long as z and y don't overlap. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given that y is also inside x without touching its boundary, this scenario is possible as long as z and y don't overlap. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   For this to be true, x and z must be coincident. If x equals z, then z would contain y (since x contains y), but this contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check:

Actually, I think I made a mistake in my latest analysis. Let's be more careful:

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. 
DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected.

Let's go through each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x and z are disconnected, then any part of x (including y) would also be disconnected from z. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect.
   If x and z touch at their boundaries, then the interior of x (which includes y) would still be disconnected from z. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   If x and z share some region, but y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z, then y and z would be disconnected. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z), which states that y and z are disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP, if x is inside z, then y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is also inside x without touching its boundary (due to NTPPi(x,y)), z and y could be separate regions within x. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is also inside x without touching its boundary, they could be separate regions within x. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   If x and z are the same, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But let me double-check again by drawing out the scenarios to make sure they're consistent.

For TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)). Since y and z are disconnected (from DC(y,z)), they don't share any parts or touch. This scenario is valid.

For NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since y and z are disconnected, they don't share any parts or touch. This scenario is also valid.

Actually, let me think more about the PO(x,z) case:

PO(x,z) means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Given that y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y doesn't share any part with z (from DC(y,z)), the overlap between x and z must not include y. This requires y to be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. This scenario is consistent with our constraints.

In summary, given NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me use a more pictorial approach to verify. 

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, fully contained with a gap between y and x's boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z don't share any space and don't touch.

Let's consider each potential relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are completely separate. This is consistent with y being in x and z being separate from y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is also consistent since y, being inside x with a gap to x's boundary, would still be separate from z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some space but neither is contained in the other. This is consistent as long as the shared space doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is contained in z without touching z's boundary. Again, this would place y inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent as long as z and y don't overlap within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is contained in x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent as long as z and y don't overlap inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x equals z, then y would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

This confirms our earlier conclusion: given NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (no shared points)

Now I'll examine each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are completely disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries only. This is possible since y is well inside x and would still be disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible as long as the overlapping region doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is impossible because if x were inside z, then y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is impossible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible since z could be inside x (touching x's boundary) while remaining disconnected from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible since z could be inside x (not touching x's boundary) while remaining disconnected from y.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This is impossible because if x=z, then y would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).
