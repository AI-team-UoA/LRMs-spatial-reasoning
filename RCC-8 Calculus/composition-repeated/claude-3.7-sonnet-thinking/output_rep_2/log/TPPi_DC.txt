PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given information and determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- DC(y,z): This means y and z are disconnected. They don't share any points, and they don't even touch.

Now, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Let's think about the spatial arrangement:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- z is completely outside of y, with no connection

Given this setup, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected (they touch at their boundaries).
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely within z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely within x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal.

Now, I'll evaluate each of these possibilities given the constraints:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If z is outside the boundary of x, then x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): This is possible. If z touches the boundary of x but doesn't overlap with it, then x and z are externally connected.
3. PO(x,z): This is possible. z could overlap with part of x (but not with y).
4. TPP(x,z): Is this possible? It would mean x is completely within z. But y is completely within x and y is disconnected from z. This seems contradictory. If x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y should be inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be a tangential proper part of x, as long as z doesn't overlap with y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, as long as z doesn't overlap with y.
8. EQ(x,z): Is this possible? If x and z are equal, and y is inside x, then y would also be inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, hold on. Let me double-check my reasoning for case 6 and 7...

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is also a tangential proper part of x, is it possible for z to be in x but disconnected from y? Yes, z could be in a different part of x, away from y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, z could be in a different part of x, away from y.

Actually, let me be more careful. I made a mistake above. TPPi(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y (not the other way around). Let's re-analyze:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of x. This actually means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

But wait, that can't be right because the "i" in TPPi means "inverse". So TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

OK, let me re-read the definitions to be sure:

- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected. They don't share any points, and they don't even touch.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is this possible? If x is completely disconnected from z, and y is inside x, then y would also be disconnected from z. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is possible.
2. EC(x,z): Is this possible? If x and z are externally connected (touching at their boundaries), and y is inside x and touches x's boundary, could y still be disconnected from z? Yes, if y touches a part of x's boundary that doesn't touch z. So EC(x,z) is possible.
3. PO(x,z): Is this possible? If x and z partially overlap, and y is inside x, could y still be disconnected from z? Yes, if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Is this possible? It would mean x is completely within z. But y is inside x and touches x's boundary. If x is inside z, then y would also be inside z, which means y and z would have to share some points, contradicting DC(y,z). Actually, wait, I'm making a mistake here. If x is inside z, it doesn't mean every point in x intersects with z. It means x is a subset of z, so every point in x is also in z. So if y is inside x, then y would also be inside z, which means DC(y,z) would be violated. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): By the same reasoning, this is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Is this possible? It would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is also a tangential proper part of x, and y is disconnected from z, is this possible? Yes, z could be in a different part of x away from y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Is this possible? It would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, z could be in a different part of x away from y. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Is this possible? If x and z are equal, and y is inside x, then y would also be inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

To double-check, let's clarify the definitions of TPP and NTPP:

- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

If TPP(x,z), it means x is a proper part of z, and x touches z's boundary. If y is inside x (which we know from TPPi(x,y)), then y would also be inside z. But we're given that DC(y,z), which means y and z are disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, if NTPP(x,z), it means x is a proper part of z, but x doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if y is inside x, then y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me re-analyze the TPPi and NTPPi cases a bit more carefully:

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is also a tangential proper part of x, and y is disconnected from z, is this possible? Yes, z could be in a different part of x away from y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, z could be in a different part of x away from y. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I need to be more specific here. NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Now we need to consider whether this is consistent with DC(y,z) (that is, y and z are disconnected, meaning z and y don't share any spatial parts). The fact that y and z both belong to x doesn't itself imply they share spatial parts. So as long as y and z don't overlap, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This can be consistent with DC(y,z) if z and y don't share any spatial parts.

Wait, actually I need to think about the definition of DC more precisely. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected. In the RCC-8 calculus, it means they don't share any points (not even boundary points). They are completely separate.

Now, let me re-examine the cases:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is a part of x) and z are also disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z).
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means they touch at their boundaries. Is this compatible with TPPi(x,y) (y is a tangential proper part of x) and DC(y,z) (y and z are disconnected)? Yes, if y touches a part of x's boundary that doesn't touch z. So EC(x,z) is possible.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share some interior points. Is this compatible with TPPi(x,y) (y is a tangential proper part of x) and DC(y,z) (y and z are disconnected)? Yes, if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely within z and touches z's boundary. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is within x and touches x's boundary. Since x is within z, y would also be within z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPP, this would mean y is within z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely within x and touches x's boundary. Is this compatible with TPPi(x,y) (y is a tangential proper part of x) and DC(y,z) (y and z are disconnected)? Yes, z could be in a different part of x away from y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPPi, this is possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then y would also be a tangential proper part of z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

OK I think that's the correct answer. To make sure, let me draw a diagram for each of the 5 possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z):
   x is a region, y is a tangential proper part of x, z is a region disconnected from both x and y.
   This is clearly possible, and DC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z):
   x is a region, y is a tangential proper part of x and touches x's boundary at a point that doesn't touch z, and z is a region that touches x at their boundaries.
   This is possible, and DC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z don't share any points (they are in different parts of the space).

3. PO(x,z):
   x is a region, y is a tangential proper part of x and is located in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z, and z is a region that partially overlaps with x.
   This is possible, and DC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z don't share any points (they are in different parts of the space).

4. TPPi(x,z):
   x is a region, y is a tangential proper part of x, z is a tangential proper part of x, and y and z don't share any points.
   This is possible, and DC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z don't share any points.

5. NTPPi(x,z):
   x is a region, y is a tangential proper part of x, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y and z don't share any points.
   This is possible, and DC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z don't share any points.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected (they share no points and don't touch)

Now I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x and z are completely disconnected, this is consistent with y and z being disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x and z touch at their boundaries, y can still be in a part of x that doesn't touch z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x and z partially overlap, y can be in the non-overlapping part of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is inside z, then y would have to be inside z too (since y is inside x), which contradicts DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, while remaining separate from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while remaining separate from y.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are identical, then y would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
