PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what RCC-8 spatial relationships are possible between regions x and z given that we know:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they share no spatial parts)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means that z is a tangential proper part of y, or TPP(z,y)

Let's analyze this:

1. TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
2. DC(x,y) means x and y are completely disconnected.

Now I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Given that z is completely inside y (touching y's boundary), and x is completely outside y, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y and x is outside y, x and z cannot overlap or be equal. They also cannot have any part-whole relationships (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) because those would require some form of overlap.

It seems like the only possible relationship between x and z is DC (disconnected), because:
- x is completely outside of y
- z is completely inside y
- Therefore, x and z must be disconnected

However, I should double-check whether EC (externally connected) is possible. Could x and z touch at their boundaries while still maintaining the other relationships?

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any points, not even boundary points
- TPP(z,y): z is completely inside y, touching y's boundary

If z touches y's boundary from the inside, and x is completely separate from y (not even touching y's boundary), then x cannot possibly touch z's boundary. So EC is not possible either.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC (disconnected).

Actually, I need to be more careful here. Let me revisit the definitions:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y, or TPP(z,y)

So TPPi(y,z) means that y properly contains z, and z touches the boundary of y. 

Let me visualize this:
- y contains z, with z touching the boundary of y from inside
- x is completely disconnected from y

Since x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y touching y's boundary, x must be disconnected from z as well. So the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me think through this more carefully. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- DC(x,y): x and y share no points
- TPP(z,y): z is properly inside y, touching y's boundary

Since x is completely disconnected from y, and z is inside y, x must be disconnected from z as well. So the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Let me correct my understanding.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

So the correct interpretation is:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- TPPi(y,z): y is properly contained in z, touching z's boundary

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since y is properly contained in z, z is larger than y and contains it. And since x is disconnected from y, x could have various relationships with z:

1. DC(x,z): x could be completely disconnected from z
2. EC(x,z): x could touch z's boundary without overlapping with z
3. PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z in areas outside of y
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z (outside of y)
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (completely inside z but outside of y)

Let me think through these possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) is definitely possible. If x is disconnected from y, and y is part of z, then x could be disconnected from z as well.

2. EC(x,z) is possible too. x could touch z's boundary without overlapping with z or y.

3. PO(x,z) is possible. x could overlap with a part of z that doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z) is possible. x could be completely inside z, touching z's boundary, without overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) is possible. x could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and still not overlapping with y.

The other relations (TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible:
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a proper part of x, but z contains y and x is disconnected from y, so this can't happen.
- NTPPi(x,z) would similarly mean z is completely inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region, which contradicts DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, I need to check if these are all valid. Let me analyze each case more carefully.

Case 1: DC(x,z)
If x is disconnected from z, and y is a part of z, then x would also be disconnected from y. This is consistent with our given DC(x,y), so DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Case 2: EC(x,z)
If x is externally connected to z, then x touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, we need to check if x can touch z's boundary without touching y. This is possible if x touches a part of z's boundary that y doesn't touch. So EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Case 3: PO(x,z)
If x partially overlaps z, then x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since y is inside z and x is disconnected from y, x can overlap with parts of z that don't include y. So PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Case 4: TPP(x,z)
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is also inside z and touches z's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, x would have to be in a different part of z than y. This is possible, so TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Case 5: NTPP(x,z)
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, x can be in a different interior part of z than y. So NTPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

To confirm my understanding, TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning z properly contains y and y touches the boundary of z.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
- TPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z, touching z's boundary

Since y is contained in z, and x is disconnected from y, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Hmm, let me think about these spatial relations more carefully.

The key insight is that TPPi(y,z) means y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary, while DC(x,y) means x and y are completely disconnected.

Let me draw a diagram mentally:
- z is a large region
- y is a smaller region completely inside z, touching z's boundary
- x is completely disconnected from y

Now, what could be the relationship between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x could be completely outside z, sharing no points with z.
2. EC(x,z): x could touch z's boundary without overlapping with z.
3. PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z, sharing some interior points.
4. TPP(x,z): x could be completely inside z, touching z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

All of these are consistent with x being disconnected from y, as long as x doesn't overlap with the part of z that contains y.

The remaining relations are not possible:
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is properly contained in x, which contradicts TPPi(y,z) and DC(x,y).
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary, which also contradicts TPPi(y,z) and DC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region, which contradicts TPPi(y,z) and DC(x,y).

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, I just realized that I'm not checking the constraints carefully. Let me verify that each of these possibilities is consistent with the given conditions.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Case 1: DC(x,z)
If x is disconnected from z, and y is inside z, then x is disconnected from y. This is consistent with DC(x,y), so DC(x,z) is valid.

Case 2: EC(x,z)
If x touches z's boundary without overlapping z, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, then x and y could potentially touch if they both touch the same part of z's boundary. But we know DC(x,y), which means x and y must not share any points, including boundary points. So x and y must touch different parts of z's boundary. This is possible, so EC(x,z) is valid.

Case 3: PO(x,z)
If x partially overlaps z, then x shares some interior points with z. Since y is contained in z, we need to ensure that the overlap between x and z doesn't include y, to maintain DC(x,y). This is possible if x overlaps with parts of z that don't include y. So PO(x,z) is valid.

Case 4: TPP(x,z)
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is also inside z and touches z's boundary, we need to ensure that x and y don't overlap, to maintain DC(x,y). This is possible if x and y are in different parts of z. So TPP(x,z) is valid.

Case 5: NTPP(x,z)
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y touches z's boundary, x and y would be in different parts of z, which is consistent with DC(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is valid.

So my analysis holds: the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, let me revisit the TPP(x,z) case. If TPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if y is also inside z and touches z's boundary, could x and y touch at some point on z's boundary? 

Let's think through this:
- TPP(x,z) means x is tangentially properly part of z
- TPPi(y,z) means y is tangentially properly part of z
- DC(x,y) means x and y share no points

So if both x and y touch z's boundary, they must touch different parts of z's boundary to maintain DC(x,y). This is certainly possible, so TPP(x,z) remains a valid possibility.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between regions x and z based on the given constraints:

1. DC(x,y) - x and y are disconnected, sharing no points
2. TPPi(y,z) - y properly contains z, with z touching y's boundary (or equivalently, TPP(z,y))

Let me analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

Since DC(x,y) means x and y share no points, and TPPi(y,z) means y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary, I can determine:

- DC(x,z): Possible - x can be completely outside z
- EC(x,z): Possible - x can touch z's boundary without overlapping
- PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap with z in areas that don't include y
- TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z touching z's boundary, but not overlapping with y
- NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, not overlapping with y

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible because they would require z to be contained in x, which would conflict with the given conditions.
