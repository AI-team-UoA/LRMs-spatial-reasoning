PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have NTPP(x,y), which means that x is a part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary. In other words, x is a proper part of y and is strictly inside y.

We also have EQ(y,z), which means that y and z are coincident, or effectively identical as far as their spatial extent.

So we need to determine what relationship holds between x and z.

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), then any relationship that holds between x and y should also hold between x and z.

Given that NTPP(x,y), i.e., x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z are identical, then x should also be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check that. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical.

Since y and z are identical, z has the same boundary as y. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary, x doesn't touch z's boundary either. And since x is a proper part of y, and y and z are identical, x is also a proper part of z.

So indeed, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me verify this from a different angle. Since y and z are identical, we can substitute z for y in the statement NTPP(x,y) to get NTPP(x,z). This should be a valid inference given the semantics of EQ.

So the answer is: NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

The question asks for the relationship between x and z when NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are spatially identical.

Since y and z are identical (EQ relation), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Because x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is identical to z, x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
