PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about the RCC-8 relations and how they compose.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap - they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

I need to determine what the possible relations are between x and z.

Let's analyze this:

Since PO(x,y), x and y share some region, but x also has some part outside of y.
Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

What does this tell us about the possible relationships between x and z?

The part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z (because y is inside z).
However, the part of x that is outside y could be:
1. Completely outside z (resulting in DC(x,z) or EC(x,z))
2. Overlapping with z (resulting in PO(x,z))
3. Completely inside z but touching z's boundary (resulting in TPP(x,z))
4. Completely inside z without touching z's boundary (resulting in NTPP(x,z))

Let me consider each case:

Case 1: Can x be disconnected from z (DC(x,z))?
If x and y share a region, and y is completely inside z, then x must share that region with z as well. So x cannot be disconnected from z. DC(x,z) is not possible.

Case 2: Can x externally connect with z (EC(x,z))?
If x and y share a region, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then the part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z, away from z's boundary. The remaining part of x could touch z's boundary from the outside, creating an external connection. But this would mean x shares an interior part with z (the part that overlaps with y), which contradicts EC. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Case 3: Can x partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))?
Yes, if part of x overlaps with y (which is inside z), and part of x extends outside z, then x partially overlaps with z.

Case 4: Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))?
Yes, if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, while also overlapping with y (which is inside z), then TPP(x,z) holds.

Case 5: Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))?
Yes, if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while also overlapping with y (which is inside z), then NTPP(x,z) holds.

Case 6: Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))?
This would mean x properly contains z, and z touches x's boundary. But we know y is properly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)). If z were inside x, then y would be completely inside x, contradicting PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Case 7: Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))?
Similar to case 6, this would contradict PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Case 8: Can x be equal to z (EQ(x,z))?
If x and z were equal, then y would have to be properly inside x (NTPP(y,x)). But we know PO(x,y), which means y is not properly inside x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me go through each case again carefully, because I'm not fully confident in my analysis.

We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x and y share a region (from PO(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), then x must share a region with z as well. So x cannot be disconnected from z. DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch only at their boundaries.
   If x and y share interior points (from PO(x,y)), and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), then x and z must share interior points as well. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y) and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, while also overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while also overlapping with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But we know y is completely inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), and x and y partially overlap (from PO(x,y)). If z were inside x, then y would be completely inside x, contradicting PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to case 6, this would contradict PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z were equal, then y would be completely inside x (from NTPP(y,z)). But we know PO(x,y), which means y is not completely inside x. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Hmm, I see there's a possible issue in my reasoning for cases 6 and 7. Let me reconsider those cases.

Case 6 (TPPi(x,z)): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z would be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. We know y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), which means y is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This contradicts PO(x,y), which requires that neither x nor y be part of the other. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Case 7 (NTPPi(x,z)): Similarly, if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y would be completely inside x, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

So, based on this more careful analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning by thinking more visually about this.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Let's call the shared part of x and y as "s". So s is part of both x and y.

Since NTPP(y,z), the entirety of y, including s, is inside z and away from z's boundary.

Now, the rest of x (x-s) could be:
1. Completely outside z (leading to PO(x,z))
2. Partly inside and partly outside z (still PO(x,z))
3. Completely inside z and touching z's boundary (leading to TPP(x,z))
4. Completely inside z and not touching z's boundary (leading to NTPP(x,z))

So the possible relations are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This confirms my previous conclusion.

Let me make one more check. The RCC-8 composition table should tell us the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). According to the RCC-8 composition table, PO(x,y) âˆ˜ NTPP(y,z) = {PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)}.

This confirms our reasoning.

So the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what possible relationships can hold between x and z given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

From PO(x,y), we know x and y share some interior region, but neither is contained within the other.

From NTPP(y,z), we know y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Since x and y overlap, and y is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), there are three possibilities for x:

1. x could extend beyond z's boundary, creating a partial overlap with z: PO(x,z)

2. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary: TPP(x,z)

3. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary: NTPP(x,z)

No other relationships are possible because the part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
