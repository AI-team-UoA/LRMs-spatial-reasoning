PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's understand the given information:
- EQ(x,y): This means that x and y are coincident. In other words, they occupy the same space.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Now, I want to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. 

And since NTPPi(y,z), that means z is a region that properly contains y, and y (and hence x) doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given that x is the same region as y (due to EQ(x,y)), and y is a proper part of z that doesn't touch the boundary of z (due to NTPPi(y,z)), we can infer that x is also a proper part of z that doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

No, wait, I think I got it wrong. Let me reconsider:
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). It's not that "y is a proper part of z", but rather "z is a proper part of y".

Since NTPPi(y,z), it means that y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

And since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. So, x also properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this one more time to be sure:

- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident or the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means that y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since x and y are the same region, and y properly contains z, it follows that x also properly contains z. And since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and x and y are the same region, it means z doesn't touch the boundary of x either.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I got mixed up. Let me clarify the meaning of NTPPi(y,z):

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). It means NTPP(z,y), which is that z is a proper part of y and does not touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's reason step by step:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (the same region).
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and does not touch the boundary of y.

Since x and y are the same region, and z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y, it follows that z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm still mixing up the meaning of NTPPi. Let me clarify:

I said earlier that "NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y)". But the "i" in NTPPi stands for "inverse", so NTPPi(y,z) actually means NTPP(z,y).

Given that:
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y).
- NTPP(z,y) means that z is a proper part of y and does not touch the boundary of y.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means that y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's analyze:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (the same region).
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since x and y are the same region, and y properly contains z, it follows that x also properly contains z. And since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and x and y are the same region, it means z doesn't touch the boundary of x either.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I feel like I'm going in circles. Let me rethink more clearly:

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). It means that y is the NTPP (Non-Tangential Proper Part) of z. In other words, y is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z.

Given that:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z.

Since x and y are identical regions, and y is a proper part of z that doesn't touch the boundary of z, it follows that x is also a proper part of z that doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I got confused again. Let's clarify one more time:

The definition of NTPPi(y,z) is that it's the inverse of NTPP(y,z). It means NTPP(z,y), which is that y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's break it down more systematically:

- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z that doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which would be NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, the problem states:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since x and y are identical regions, and z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y, it follows that z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hold on, let me reconsider the definitions again:

- NTPPi(y,z) is defined as "the same as NTPP(z,y)", which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given that:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since x and y are identical regions, and z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y, it follows that z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I apologize for my confusion earlier. Let's make sure we're correct:

NTPPi(y,z) means "y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z". The "i" stands for "inverse". This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, or NTPP(z,y).

So, NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, given that:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since x and y are identical regions, and z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y, it follows that z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I just realized I've been inconsistently interpreting NTPPi(y,z). Let's be more precise:

- NTPP(a,b) means that a is a proper part of b and doesn't touch the boundary of b.
- NTPPi(a,b) is the inverse of NTPP(a,b), which means NTPP(b,a). So, NTPPi(a,b) means that b is a proper part of a and doesn't touch the boundary of a.

Given that:
- NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, which is NTPP(z,y).

Now, let's reason step by step:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given that x and y are identical, if z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y, then z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, there's something I've been getting confused about. Let's define the relations more clearly:

- NTPP(a,b): a is a proper part of b and doesn't touch the boundary of b.
- NTPPi(a,b): b is a proper part of a and doesn't touch the boundary of a.

Given the definition, NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's reason step by step:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since x and y are identical regions, and z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y, it follows that z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself again. Let's be systematic:

TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b. TPPi(a,b) means that b is a tangential proper part of a. TPPi(a,b) is equivalent to TPP(b,a).

Similarly, NTPP(a,b) means that a is a non-tangential proper part of b. NTPPi(a,b) means that b is a non-tangential proper part of a. NTPPi(a,b) is equivalent to NTPP(b,a).

Actually, now that I think about it, I realized something we have to be careful about:
- NTPPi(y,z) would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- But we need to derive the relationship between x and z.

Let's try to reason more systematically for all RCC-8 relations. We know that:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, since x and y are identical regions (EQ(x,y)), x has the same relationship with z as y does. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to be even more precise about the meaning of NTPPi:

- NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which is the same as NTPP(z,y). This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Given this definition:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since x and y are identical regions, and z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Ok, I feel like I've been overthinking this. I got confused about the meaning of NTPPi, but I think I have it clear now:

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which is equivalent to saying NTPP(z,y). This means that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given this:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since x and y are identical regions, and z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I have my directions reversed here.

Let's consider what the problem is asking again:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is the non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which means NTPP(z,y). This implies that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

We want to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since x and y are identical (due to EQ(x,y)), and z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch the boundary of y (due to NTPPi(y,z)), it follows that z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Thus, the relationship between x and z can be expressed as NTPPi(x,z).

Ok, I'm pretty sure I have the correct understanding now. Let's check one more time.

Let's use the explicit definition provided in the prompt:

1. EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident. This implies that x and y are identical regions.
2. NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Given these, if z is a part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary, and x and y are identical regions, then z is also a part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This gives us NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me check my work using the definitions provided in the problem statement:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
2. NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x), which means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
3. EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

Given the problem:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region, and z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary, it implies that z is also part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This gives us NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let's verify my answer:

1. Given: EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).
2. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident, i.e., they are the same region.
3. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
4. Since x and y are the same region, if z is a part of y, then z is also a part of x.
5. Also, since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and the boundaries of x and y are the same, z doesn't touch x's boundary either.
6. Thus, z is a part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary, which gives us NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, my final answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check by reasoning in the reverse direction:

If the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), then:
1. NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is a part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. Given that EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region, so their boundaries are the same.
3. If z is a part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary, then z is also a part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary, which means NTPP(z,y) or equivalently, NTPPi(y,z).

This confirms that NTPPi(x,z) is the relationship between x and z.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to understand what each relation means and then determine how they compose.

First, let's clarify the given relations:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same region)
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary

Now, I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), this means x and y are identical regions. They have the same boundaries and interior.

Since NTPPi(y,z), this means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Because x and y are identical (due to EQ(x,y)), and z is contained completely within y without touching its boundary, the same relationship must hold between x and z:
- z must be a proper part of x
- z must not touch x's boundary

This relationship is precisely NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
