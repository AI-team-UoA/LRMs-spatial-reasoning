PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. 

We're given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is a proper part of y (so x is entirely contained within y), and x touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are the same spatial region. So any relationship that x has with y, it will also have with z.

In this case, TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary).

Since z is equal to y, x will have the same relationship with z. So we have TPP(x,z).

But wait, I should verify this more carefully.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (x is fully contained within y, and x ≠ y)
- x touches the boundary of y

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z occupy exactly the same spatial region

Given these, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since y and z are the same spatial region, and x is a tangential proper part of y, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Let me double-check by considering the definitions of all the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: This cannot be true because x is inside y, which is equal to z, so x must be inside z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected: This cannot be true because x is inside y, which is equal to z, so x must be inside z, not just touching it externally.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: This cannot be true because x is fully contained within y, which is equal to z, so x must be fully contained within z, not just partially overlapping.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This is true because x is a tangential proper part of y, and y equals z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This cannot be true because we know x touches the boundary of y, and since y equals z, x must also touch the boundary of z, making it a tangential rather than non-tangential proper part.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This cannot be true because x is inside y, which equals z, so z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This cannot be true for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This cannot be true because x is a proper part of y, which equals z, so x must be a proper part of z and therefore not equal to z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, I want to confirm one more time by analyzing the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition of TPP and EQ is defined as:
TPP ∘ EQ = TPP

This means that if TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z). This confirms our reasoning above.

Therefore, the answer is TPP(x,z).

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful. Let me check using the RCC-8 composition table.

For the composition of TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the resulting relation between x and z should be TPP.

The RCC-8 composition table for TPP ∘ EQ:
TPP ∘ EQ = TPP

So, the answer is indeed TPP(x,z).

Let me summarize:
- We have TPP(x,y), which means x is a tangential proper part of y.
- We have EQ(y,z), which means y and z are the same spatial region.
- Therefore, x must also be a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the existing relationships constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical spatial regions, any relationship that x has with y must be the same relationship x has with z.

Therefore, if TPP(x,y) and y is identical to z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
