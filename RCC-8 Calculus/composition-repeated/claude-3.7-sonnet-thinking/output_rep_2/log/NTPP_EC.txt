PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's recall the meanings of these relations:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is properly contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap.

Now I need to determine what relationships could hold between x and z given these constraints.

Let's go through the possibilities one by one:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, sharing no parts. This is definitely possible. Since x is strictly inside y, and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z could be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, touching at their boundaries. This is impossible. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x does not touch y's boundary. And since z only touches y at y's boundary (EC(y,z)), z cannot reach inside y to touch x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This seems impossible given the constraints. Since x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, z cannot overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is impossible for the same reason as EC and PO. Since z only touches y at the boundary, it cannot contain x, which is strictly inside y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is impossible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because z touches y's boundary (by EC(y,z)), but x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is impossible because if x and z were equal, and x is strictly inside y, then z would also be strictly inside y, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, based on my analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z) - they are disconnected.

Actually, let me double-check this by reasoning about it differently. 

We know that NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. We also know that EC(y,z) means that y and z touch only at their boundaries.

Given these facts, can z overlap with x? No, because that would mean z overlaps with y's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

Can x overlap with z? No, for the same reason - x is completely inside y, so any overlap with z would contradict EC(y,z).

Can x contain z? No, because x is completely inside y, and z is (at least partially) outside y.

Can z contain x? No, because z only touches y at the boundary, so it can't reach inside y to contain x.

Can x and z be equal? No, because x is inside y and z is (mostly) outside y.

Can x and z be externally connected? No, because x doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch z, which only touches y at y's boundary.

So, the only possibility left is that x and z are disconnected: DC(x,z).

Actually, wait a moment. Let me think about this more carefully. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.

Now, could there be a situation where x and z have a relation other than DC? Let's think about each possibility:

1. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries. But x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, so x and z cannot touch.

2. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But if z overlaps with x, it would overlap with y's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

3. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But for x to be part of z, z would have to overlap with y's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

4. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But again, for x to be part of z, z would have to overlap with y's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But z is externally connected to y, so it can't be completely contained within y, which x is.

6. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But z touches y's boundary, while x does not, so z cannot be a proper part of x.

7. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. But x is completely inside y, while z is not, so they cannot be equal.

So, the only possible relation is DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.

Oh wait, I just realized there's a flaw in my reasoning. The fact that z is externally connected to y doesn't necessarily mean that z is "mostly" outside y. It could be that z is mostly inside y but touches y's boundary at some point. This could allow for some additional possible relations between x and z.

Let's reconsider from the beginning:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, sharing no parts. This is definitely possible, as I've already reasoned.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, touching at their boundaries. This still seems impossible. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x does not touch y's boundary. And since z only touches y at y's boundary (EC(y,z)), z cannot reach inside y to touch x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Upon reconsideration, this also seems impossible. If z overlaps with x, it means z has a part inside y's interior. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, only boundary points. So, z cannot overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is impossible because for x to be tangential to z, it would need to touch z's boundary. But x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only interacts with y at y's boundary, so x cannot touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is also impossible. For z to contain x, z would need to have a part inside y's interior. But EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points, only boundary points.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because z touches y's boundary (by EC(y,z)), but x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi. If z were a proper part of x, it would be entirely within y's interior. But EC(y,z) means z touches y's boundary, so z cannot be entirely within y's interior.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is impossible because if x and z were equal, and x is strictly inside y, then z would also be strictly inside y, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, once again, I conclude that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z) - they are disconnected.

Actually, let me think about this geometrically. 

We have NTPP(x,y), so x is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary. Visually, x is completely inside y.

We also have EC(y,z), so y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap interiorly. Visually, y and z touch at their edges.

Now, considering the position of x inside y, and the fact that z only touches y at the boundary, what could be the relationship between x and z?

Since x doesn't touch y's boundary and z doesn't penetrate into y's interior, x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, they must be disconnected: DC(x,z).

I think I've scrutinized this thoroughly now. My answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me examine EC(y,z) more closely. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This implies that the interiors of y and z are disjoint, and their boundaries intersect.

Now, for x, we have NTPP(x,y), which means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This means x is entirely within the interior of y.

Since the interiors of y and z are disjoint, and x is entirely within the interior of y, it follows that x is disjoint from the interior of z. Furthermore, since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't touch the boundary of z either (which can only interact with y at y's boundary).

So, x and z can't share interior points and can't share boundary points. The only possible relationship is that they are disconnected: DC(x,z).

Actually, why don't I test the composition of these two relationships in a composition table from the literature?  the RCC-8 composition table gives us the possible results of combining RCC-8 relations. For NTPP(x,y) composed with EC(y,z), the result should be the possible relation(s) between x and z.

If I recall correctly, the result of the composition NTPP âˆ˜ EC is DC, which means that if NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), then DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

So, my final answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely contained within y
- x does not touch y's boundary

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share any interior parts

Analyzing the possible relationships:

1. Could x and z be disconnected (DC)? Yes, since x is strictly inside y without touching y's boundary, and z only touches y at y's boundary, they cannot share any points.

2. Could x and z be externally connected (EC)? No, because x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only interacts with y at y's boundary, so they cannot touch.

3. Could x and z partially overlap (PO)? No, because z cannot penetrate y's interior (by EC(y,z)), so it cannot reach x.

4. Could x be part of z (TPP or NTPP)? No, because z would need to overlap with y's interior to contain x, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. Could z be part of x (TPPi or NTPPi)? No, because z touches y's boundary while x doesn't, so z cannot be contained within x.

6. Could x and z be equal (EQ)? No, because x is strictly inside y while z is not.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
