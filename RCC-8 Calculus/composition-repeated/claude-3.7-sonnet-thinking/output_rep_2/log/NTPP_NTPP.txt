PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. In other words, x is a proper part of y and is completely contained in the interior of y.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. So y is a proper part of z and is completely contained in the interior of z.

Now, given these two conditions, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since x is completely contained in the interior of y, and y is completely contained in the interior of z, it follows that x must be completely contained in the interior of z as well. This means x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

However, let me think about this again to make sure:

x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.
y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

So x must be completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

The relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double check this. 

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y (not equal to y) and does not touch y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z (not equal to z) and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, by transitivity, x must be a proper part of z.

And since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, x is 'surrounded' by parts of y, which are then 'surrounded' by parts of z. This means x cannot touch z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I should be careful about the requirement "does not touch y's boundary". Let me think about this once more:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary. In other words, x is completely within the interior of y.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. In other words, y is completely within the interior of z.

Given that x is completely within the interior of y, and y is completely within the interior of z, it follows that x is completely within the interior of z. This means that x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me be even more precise on the definition of NTPP(x,y). It means that all parts of x are also parts of y (i.e., x is part of y), x is not equal to y, and no part of x coincides with the boundary of y.

Similarly, NTPP(y,z) means that all parts of y are also parts of z, y is not equal to z, and no part of y coincides with the boundary of z.

Given these, if all parts of x are also parts of y, and all parts of y are also parts of z, then all parts of x are also parts of z. So, x is part of z.

Since x is not equal to y and y is not equal to z, x cannot be equal to z. So, x is a proper part of z.

Moreover, since no part of x coincides with the boundary of y, and no part of y coincides with the boundary of z, no part of x can coincide with the boundary of z. This is because the boundary of z is outside of y (since no part of y coincides with the boundary of z), and since all of x is inside y, no part of x can reach the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relation holds between x and z when we know that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary. This means x is completely contained within the interior of y.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. This means y is completely contained within the interior of z.

Combining these facts:
- Since x is completely within y's interior
- And y is completely within z's interior
- Then x must be completely within z's interior

Therefore, x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).
