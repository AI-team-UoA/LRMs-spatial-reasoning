PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's understand what these given relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means the same as TPP(y,x). So TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, I need to determine what relation(s) can hold between x and z.

Let's think about what we know:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary

We need to find all possible RCC-8 relations that can hold between x and z. The possible relations are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Let's analyze each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least some region (namely, y). So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap. But we know y is part of both x and z, so x and z must overlap. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. Given that y is inside both x and z, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z, it's possible that x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, it's possible that x also touches z's boundary. And since y is inside both x and z, with x potentially being completely inside z, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary. Even though y touches the boundary of z, it's possible that x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is inside z, and y touches x's boundary. For z to be completely inside x, z would have to be smaller than x. But then, how could y be inside z and still touch the boundary of x? This seems contradictory. So TPPi(x,z) seems impossible.

Wait, let me reconsider TPPi(x,z) more carefully. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary, it's possible that y touches the boundary of z at a point where z touches the boundary of x. In this way, y could be inside z, touching z's boundary, and also touching x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is actually a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary. But we know y touches x's boundary and y is inside z. If z is completely inside x without touching its boundary, then y, being inside z, couldn't touch the boundary of x. This is contradictory. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, then y would have to be a tangential proper part of both, which is consistent with what we're given. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

For TPPi(x,z), I now think it's actually impossible. If z is inside x, and y is inside z, then y is inside x, which is consistent. However, if z touches x's boundary and y touches z's boundary, it's not necessarily the case that y touches x's boundary. But we know from TPPi(x,y) that y touches x's boundary. So, y would have to touch z's boundary at a point where z touches x's boundary for this to work. But then, z wouldn't be a proper part of x, contradicting TPPi(x,z). So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, I'm not sure if my reasoning about TPPi(x,z) is correct, because the exact definition of "touching" in TPP and TPPi isn't clear to me. Let me think again.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If y is inside both x and z, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z, then x and z must overlap or one must be inside the other.

Let's imagine various configurations:

1. If x is completely inside z (TPP or NTPP), then y is inside x which is inside z, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z. This is possible if, for instance, x is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x, and both x and y touch the boundaries of their respective "containers" at the same point. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

2. If z is completely inside x (TPPi or NTPPi), then y is inside z which is inside x, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z. Similar to above, this is possible if z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z, and both z and y touch the boundaries of their respective "containers" at the same point. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

3. If x and z are coincident (EQ), then y is inside both x and z, which are the same, and y touches the boundary of both, which is also the same. This is consistent. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

4. If x and z partially overlap (PO), then it's possible for y to be in the overlap region and touch the boundaries of both x and z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

5. If x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP), then it's possible for y to be inside x which is inside z, and y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. This seems contradictory to TPP(y,z), which states that y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

Wait, that's not right. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, it's still possible for y to touch z's boundary if y touches x's boundary at a point where x is closest to z's boundary, and that distance is zero (i.e., y extends all the way to z's boundary). So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. Similarly, if z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi), then it's impossible for y to be inside z and also touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, I'm not thinking about this correctly. The fact that y touches the boundary of both x and z doesn't necessarily mean that y touches both boundaries at the same point.

Let's start again. If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we know:
- y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, it's possible that x also touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z but wouldn't touch z's boundary. But given that y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, it seems contradictory for x not to touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

Wait, let me think more precisely. The fact that y touches the boundary of z doesn't necessitate that x also touches the boundary of z. It could be that y extends to the boundary of x, and it's precisely at that point where y also touches the boundary of z. In this scenario, x itself might not touch the boundary of z from the inside. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Given that y is a proper part of z, and y also touches x's boundary, it's possible for z to touch x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x but wouldn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is inside z and y touches x's boundary, it seems contradictory for z not to touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, I'm still not thinking about this correctly because I'm not considering all the implications of the given relations.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and the boundaries of x and y touch. In other words, y is inside x, and there is at least one point that is on the boundary of both.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and the boundaries of y and z touch. Similarly, y is inside z, and there is at least one point that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Let's systematically look at each possible RCC-8 relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected, but y is part of both x and z, which contradicts DC's definition. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But y is part of both x and z, which means x and z must overlap. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. Given that y is part of both x and z, it's possible that x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and the boundaries of x and z touch. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, it's possible for x to also be a proper part of z. Since y touches the boundary of z from inside, and y is inside x, it's possible for x to touch the boundary of z from inside. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and the boundaries of x and z don't touch. But we know y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x. If y touches the boundary of z, then x must also touch the boundary of z, contradicting NTPP's definition. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, that's not quite right, either. We know that y touches the boundary of z, but that doesn't necessarily mean x also touches the boundary of z. The entire region of x could be inside z, and y could extend to touch the boundary of z at some point, while x as a whole doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's rethink this. If y is a tangential proper part of z, it means y is "completely inside" z except for one or more points where y touches the boundary of z. Similarly, if y is a tangential proper part of z (implied by TPP(y,z)), it means y is "completely inside" z except for one or more points where y touches the boundary of z.

Now, given these, let's reconsider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y cannot be in both x and z, which contradicts our premises. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries without overlapping, then y cannot be in both x and z, contradicting our premises. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, it's possible for y to be in the overlapping region. This would allow y to be a proper part of both x and z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, it's possible for y to be a proper part of x and, consequently, a proper part of z. This would be consistent with our premises. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, it becomes problematic because y is a proper part of x, and we're given that y touches the boundary of z. This seems contradictory. But let's consider: if y touches the boundary of x at precisely the point(s) where x is closest to the boundary of z, and that distance is zero (meaning y extends all the way to the boundary of z), then it's conceivable for y to touch the boundary of z even though x doesn't. However, this would mean that y is not strictly inside x, which contradicts the definition of TPPi. So, I believe NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, it's possible for y to be a proper part of z and, consequently, a proper part of x. This would be consistent with our premises. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, it becomes problematic because y is a proper part of z and, from TPPi(x,y), y touches the boundary of x. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, how can y (which is inside z) touch the boundary of x? This seems contradictory, so NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are coincident (the same region), then y is a proper part of both. This is consistent with our premises. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

Hmm, I'm not sure my reasoning about NTPP(x,z) is correct, because it doesn't sound right that it's impossible. Let me revisit it more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. If y is inside x and x is inside z without touching z's boundary, how could y touch the boundary of z? The only way is if x touches z's boundary, but that would contradict NTPP. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. But if y is inside z and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, how could y touch the boundary of x? It wouldn't be possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Let me try a different approach to make sure.

Imagine x, y, and z as regions. Given:
- y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

The possibilities for the relationship between x and z are:

1. x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is TPP(x,z). Since y is inside x and y touches the boundary of z, it's possible for x to also touch the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

2. x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is NTPP(x,z). If x is inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is inside x, then how can y touch the boundary of z? It seems impossible, so NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

However, there's a way this might work: if y extends to the boundary of x, and at that specific point, the boundary of x and the boundary of z coincide or are very close. In this way, y could be inside x, touch the boundary of x, and also touch the boundary of z. But for NTPP(x,z) to hold, the boundary of x should be strictly inside the boundary of z. So, the boundary of y, x, and z wouldn't coincide, contradicting our premise. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) truly is impossible.

3. z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is TPPi(x,z). If z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, then y, being inside z, must be inside x. Since y touches the boundary of x, it's possible that z also touches the boundary of x at the same point. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

4. z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z). If z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, then y, being inside z, must be inside x and shouldn't be able to touch the boundary of x. But TPPi(x,y) says y does touch the boundary of x. This is contradictory, so NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

5. x and z partially overlap. This is PO(x,z). If they partially overlap, then there's a region in common between them, and y could be inside this common region. This would allow y to be a proper part of both x and z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

6. x and z are coincident (the same region). This is EQ(x,z). If x and z are the same, then y is a proper part of both. This is consistent with our premises. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

7. x and z are disconnected. This is DC(x,z). But y is inside both x and z, which means x and z must have at least some overlap. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

8. x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is EC(x,z). But y is inside both x and z, which means x and z must have at least some overlap. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me recheck once more, especially for NTPP and NTPPi.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If y is inside x, and x is inside z without touching z's boundary, how can y touch the boundary of z? It seems impossible, so I think NTPP(x,z) is indeed ruled out.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If y is inside z, and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then how can y touch the boundary of x? It seems impossible. So NTPPi(x,z) is also ruled out.

However, let's just double check one more time.

Actually, I think there might be a point of confusion in my understanding. Let's clarify the definitions:

- TPP(a,b) means a is a proper part of b, and the boundaries of a and b touch at at least one point.
- NTPP(a,b) means a is a proper part of b, and the boundaries of a and b don't touch.

Now, let's reconsider the NTPP(x,z) case:
If x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, can y also touch z's boundary?

If y touches the boundary of x, it means y extends to the boundary of x. But since x doesn't touch the boundary of z (due to NTPP(x,z)), there's a gap between the boundaries of x and z. This would mean y can't extend to the boundary of z, contradicting TPP(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) remains impossible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z):
If z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, can y also touch x's boundary?

If y touches the boundary of z, it means y extends to the boundary of z. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of x (due to NTPPi(x,z)), there's a gap between the boundaries of z and x. This would mean y can't extend to the boundary of x, contradicting TPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) also remains impossible.

I'm now confident in saying that the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

I'll check by visualizing each of these cases to ensure they're consistent with the given relations.

1. PO(x,z): 
   Imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, and y as a smaller circle inside the overlap region. Place y so that it touches the boundary of both x and z. This would satisfy TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): 
   Imagine z as a big circle, x as a smaller circle inside it touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside x that touches both the boundary of x and the boundary of z. This would satisfy TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. TPPi(x,z): 
   Imagine x as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside it touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside z that touches both the boundary of z and the boundary of x. This would satisfy TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

4. EQ(x,z): 
   Imagine x and z as the same circle, and y as a smaller circle inside it touching the boundary. This would satisfy TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): 
   Imagine z as a big circle, x as a smaller circle inside it not touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside x. If y touches the boundary of x, it's still inside z and would not be able to touch the boundary of z, contradicting TPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. NTPPi(x,z): 
   Imagine x as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside it not touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside z. If y touches the boundary of z, it's still inside x and would not be able to touch the boundary of x, contradicting TPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. DC(x,z): 
   With TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), y is inside both x and z, which means x and z must overlap. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

8. EC(x,z): 
   With TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), y is inside both x and z, which means x and z must overlap (not just touch at the boundary). So EC(x,z) is impossible.

After this visualization check, I'm again left with the conclusion that the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Wait…actually, just to double check the NTPP(x,z) case once more: If x is a proper part of z without touching its border, y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, and y is also a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z, then we have a contradiction. Y cannot be both touching the boundary of x and the boundary of z, because the boundary of x does not touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) remains impossible.

And similarly for NTPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x without touching its border, y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z, and y is also a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, then we have a contradiction. Y cannot be both touching the boundary of z and the boundary of x, because the boundary of z does not touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) remains impossible.

So in conclusion:
Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) [x and z partially overlap]
- TPP(x,z) [x is a tangential proper part of z]
- TPPi(x,z) [z is a tangential proper part of x]
- EQ(x,z) [x and z are coincident]

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z given the constraints:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible. If y is part of both x and z, they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible. If y is part of both x and z, they must have overlapping interiors, not just boundary contact.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y in their intersection, touching both boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z, with y inside x and touching both boundaries at the point where x touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) couldn't touch z's boundary while also touching x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x, with y inside z and touching both boundaries at the point where z touches x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then y (which is inside z) couldn't touch x's boundary while also touching z's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. If x equals z, then y is a tangential proper part of both.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
