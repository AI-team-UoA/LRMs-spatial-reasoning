PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem. 

We are given that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). We need to find all possible relationships between x and z. 

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's think about the possible relationship between x and z.

1. Since EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary but does not overlap with y.
2. Since TPP(y,z), y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Given these constraints, what can we say about x and z?

First, since y is part of z, and x touches y at the boundary, it's possible that x also touches z at the boundary. This would mean EC(x,z).

Second, since y is part of z, and x touches y at the boundary, it's also possible that x overlaps with z. This would mean PO(x,z).

Third, it's also possible for x to be disconnected from z, meaning DC(x,z).

Let's double-check these possibilities with some examples:

1. Imagine y is a circle that touches the boundary of a larger circle z, and x is a circle that is external to y but touches y's boundary. In this case, x might be disconnected from z, meaning DC(x,z).

2. Imagine y is a circle that touches the boundary of a larger circle z, and x is a circle that is external to y but touches y's boundary exactly where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x also touches z at the boundary, meaning EC(x,z).

3. Imagine y is a circle that touches the boundary of a larger circle z, and x is a circle that is external to y but touches y's boundary. In this case, x might also overlap with z, meaning PO(x,z).

I'm thinking now that TPP(y,z) and EC(x,y) means that y is part of z and x touches y at y's boundary. Since y touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible that the point where x touches y is also a point on z's boundary. But it's also possible that the point where x touches y is within z's interior. So the possible relations between x and z could be:

1. EC(x,z) - if x touches z at z's boundary.
2. PO(x,z) - if x overlaps with z.
3. DC(x,z) - if x is disconnected from z.

But wait, I'm realizing that I might have misunderstood the problem. Let me think more carefully.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Given these, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x touches y at a point that's on y's boundary but not on z's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. This is possible if x touches y at a point that's on both y's boundary and z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x overlaps with z but not entirely within z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible given EC(x,y), as x would need to be entirely within z, not just touching y at the boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible given EC(x,y), as x would need to be entirely within z.

6. TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is part of x, which seems unlikely given that y is part of z and x just touches y at the boundary.

7. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This doesn't seem possible given that y is part of z, and x just touches y at the boundary.

So based on this, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z).

Now, let me double-check these possibilities with more concrete examples:

Example 1: Let z be a circle, and y be a circle fully inside z but touching z's boundary at one point. Now, let x be a circle outside y, touching y's boundary at a point that's not where y touches z. In this case, x and z do not overlap at all, thus DC(x,z).

Wait, actually, in this example, x and z might touch at the point where x touches y (if that point is also on z's boundary), or they might not touch at all (if that point is inside z). So both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are possible.

Example 2: Let z be a large circle covering half of a space. Let y be a smaller circle entirely inside z but touching z's boundary at one end. Let x be a circle half inside z and half outside, such that x touches y at y's boundary. In this case, x and z overlap, so PO(x,z).

Let me continue thinking to check if there are any other possibilities.

EC(x,y) means x and y share boundary points but not interior points.
TPP(y,z) means y is part of z, sharing interior parts, and y touches z's boundary.

Let's analyze where x can be relative to z. Since x touches y's boundary, and y is part of z, x might touch z or lie partly inside z.

Could x be entirely inside z? Yes, if x is on the inside of y's boundary that is also inside z. In that case, x could be TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm missing something. If EC(x,y) means x and y only touch at the boundary, and TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary, then where can x be relative to z?

Let's use the definitions more carefully and think step-by-step.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPP(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Since EC(x,y), x is outside of y and touches y at the boundary.

Since TPP(y,z), y is inside z, and there's at least one point where y touches the boundary of z.

Given these, let's analyze where x can be relative to z:

Case 1: x touches y at a point that is not on the boundary of z. In this case, x is partly inside z. Hence, PO(x,z).

Case 2: x touches y at a point that is also on the boundary of z. In this case, x might touch the boundary of z. Hence, EC(x,z).

Case 3: x is entirely outside z and the point where x touches y is not on the boundary of z. In this case, DC(x,z).

That's three possibilities: PO(x,z), EC(x,z), and DC(x,z).

Now, I don't think TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) are possible. If EC(x,y), then x is outside of y and only touches it at the boundary. If y is inside z, even if x touches y at a point inside z, there will still be parts of x outside of z. So x cannot be totally inside z.

Similarly, I don't think TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) are possible either. If y is inside z, and x is outside of y, then z cannot be inside x.

And for EQ(x,z), if y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x is outside of y and touches y's boundary, then x and z cannot be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z).

But I just realized that my reasoning might be influenced by assuming the regions are simple (like circles). Let me reconsider.

Actually, I think I still conclude that the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z).

The reasoning is:

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPP(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Since EC(x,y), x is outside of y and touches y at the boundary.

Since TPP(y,z), y is inside z, and there's at least one point where y touches the boundary of z.

If x touches y at a point inside z, then part of x is inside z, leading to PO(x,z).

If x touches y at a point on the boundary of z, then x might touch z at the boundary, leading to EC(x,z).

If x is entirely outside z, and the point where x touches y is inside z, then DC(x,z).

So the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z).

One more time, just as a self-check.

EC(x, y) means x and y touch at a boundary but have no spatial parts in common.
TPP(y, z) means y is part of z, and it touches the boundary of z.

What can we say about the relation between x and z?

Scenario 1: x touches y at a point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of z. In this case, x and z touch at a boundary, so EC(x, z).

Scenario 2: x touches y at a point on the boundary of y that is inside z (not on the boundary of z). If part of x extends inside z, and part is outside, then we have PO(x, z). If x is entirely inside z, we could have TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z). If x is entirely outside z, we have DC(x, z).

Let me reconsider scenario 2. If x touches y at a point on the boundary of y that is inside z, can x be entirely inside z? I don't think so, because EC(x, y) means x is outside of y, so at least part of x is outside of y. If y is inside z, and x is outside of y, is it possible for x to still be entirely inside z? Actually, yes. If y is a proper part of z, and x is outside of y, x could still be inside z.

So in scenario 2, if x touches y at a point on the boundary of y that is inside z, then x could be: entirely inside z, giving TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z); partly inside and partly outside z, giving PO(x, z); or entirely outside z, giving DC(x, z).

Actually, I need to think about this more carefully. If TPP(y, z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely inside z except where it touches the boundary of z.

If EC(x, y), then x is outside of y but touches y at the boundary.

So, where can x be relative to z?

Scenario 1: x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z. In this case, x also touches the boundary of z, leading to EC(x, z).

Scenario 2: x touches y at a point on the boundary of y that is inside z (not on the boundary of z). In this case:
- If x is entirely within z, then TPP(x, z) is possible.
- If x crosses the boundary of z, then PO(x, z) is possible.
- If x is entirely outside z, then DC(x, z) is possible.

Wait, if x is entirely within z, and touches y at a point on the boundary of y that is inside z, then x touches the boundary of z. So, TPP(x, z) is possible.

But I'm not sure if x can be entirely within z and not touch the boundary of z, which would give NTPP(x, z). I think this is not possible because x touches y at the boundary, and y is not nested deep inside z (since TPP(y, z) means y touches the boundary of z).

I need to carefully think about the possibilities. Let me draw out the scenarios.

TPP(y, z) means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z. So, y touches the boundary of z at at least one location.

EC(x, y) means x touches y at the boundary. Now, considering where x can be:

1. If x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x also touches the boundary of z. This means EC(x, z).

2. If x touches y at a point inside z (away from the boundary of z), then:
   - If x extends outside of z, then PO(x, z).
   - If x is entirely within z, let's see... if x touches y at a point inside z, and x is also entirely within z, yet EC(x, y), then x must have parts that approach the boundary of y from inside z. Now, if x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x, z) or EC(x, z), or if it does not touch the boundary of y, then NTPP(x, z). I'm less certain about these points, so I need to think more carefully.

Let me rethink the case where x touches y at a point inside z:

- If x touches y at a point on the boundary of y, and that point is inside z, can x be entirely inside z and not touch the boundary of z? Yes, that would be NTPP(x, z).
- If x touches y at a point on the boundary of y, and that point is inside z, can x be entirely inside z and touch the boundary of z? Yes, that would be TPP(x, z).
- If x touches y at a point on the boundary of y, and that point is inside z, can x extend outside of z? Yes, that would be PO(x, z).
- If x touches y at a point on the boundary of y, and that point is on the boundary of z, can x be entirely outside of z? Yes, that would be EC(x, z).

So the possibilities are DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Let me rethink the DC(x, z) case. If x touches y at a point inside z, can x be entirely outside of z? No, that's not right. If x touches y at a point inside z, at least that point of x is inside z. So x can't be entirely disconnected from z.

So the possibilities are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Hmm, I'm unsatisfied with that logic. Let me try again:

1. TPP(y, z) means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z at at least one location.
2. EC(x, y) means x touches y at the boundary.

Now let's think about the following cases.

CASE 1: x touches y at a point p which is also on the boundary of z.
- Since p is a point on the boundaries of both x and y, and p is also on the boundary of z, p is on the boundaries of x, y, and z.
- If x has parts inside z, then the relation is PO(x, z).
- If x has no parts inside z (all parts outside z except for p), then the relation is EC(x, z).

CASE 2: x touches y at a point q which is inside z (not on the boundary of z).
- In this case, at least the point q of x is inside z.
- If x is entirely inside z (except where it might touch the boundary of z), and x touches the boundary of z, then the relation is TPP(x, z).
- If x is entirely inside z, and does not touch the boundary of z, then the relation is NTPP(x, z).
- If x has parts inside z and parts outside z, then the relation is PO(x, z).

So the possible relationships are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

I'm still not sure about the DC(x, z) case. Could x be disconnected from z even when EC(x, y) and TPP(y, z)?

Actually, let's think one more time.

EC(x, y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior points. In other words, x and y share at least one point that is on the boundary of both.

TPP(y, z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is inside z, has no parts outside z, and touches the boundary of z.

Now, can x and z be disconnected?

If y is inside z, and x touches y, can x also be outside of z?

Let's think: If y touches the boundary of z at a point p, and x touches y at a point q, if p = q, then x touches y at the point where y touches the boundary of z. In this case, x touches the boundary of z at p, so x and z are not disconnected.

What if p ≠ q? In this case, x touches y at a point q which is on the boundary of y. Is q inside z or on the boundary of z?

If y is inside z and touches the boundary of z at p, but q is another point on the boundary of y (not equal to p), then q is inside z. If q is inside z, then x touches y at a point inside z. This means at least that point of x is inside z, so x and z can't be disconnected.

So, it seems like DC(x, z) is not a possibility.

I've convinced myself the options are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Let me check each of these by drawing out the scenario:

EC(x, z): x touches z at the boundary, but they don't share interior parts. This happens when x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z.

PO(x, z): x and z share interior parts, but neither is wholly contained in the other. This happens when x touches y at a point inside z, and x has parts both inside and outside of z.

TPP(x, z): x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. This happens when x touches y at a point inside z, x is wholly contained in z, and x touches the boundary of z.

NTPP(x, z): x is inside z and does not touch the boundary of z. This happens when x touches y at a point inside z, and x is wholly contained inside z without touching the boundary of z.

I've now convinced myself that the possible relations between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, I think I was overlooking TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me check those too.

TPPi(x, z) means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. NTPPi(x, z) means z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

I don't think these are possible given EC(x, y) and TPP(y, z). Because TPP(y, z) means y is inside z. And EC(x, y) means x touches y at a boundary. So, it's not possible for z to be inside x.

So, I think the possibilities are still EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, hold on, I think I still haven't really thought through the DC(x, z) case carefully. Let's see.

EC(x, y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
TPP(y, z) means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Now, is it possible for x and z to be disconnected?

If x touches y at a point p, this means p is on the boundary of both x and y. Now, since TPP(y, z), y is inside z. So the point p, being on the boundary of y, is either inside z or on the boundary of z.

If p is inside z, then at least the point p of x is inside z, so x and z can't be disconnected.

If p is on the boundary of z, then x touches the boundary of z at p, so x and z can't be disconnected.

So, DC(x, z) is indeed not a possibility.

However, I just realized that I might have overlooked a subtlety. In the RCC-8 system, regions are often considered to be interiors with boundaries. So, when two regions touch, they share a boundary point. In this case, it's the boundaries that touch, not the interiors.

With this in mind, if x touches y at a point p on the boundary of y, and y is inside z with its boundary touching the boundary of z at a point q, then p and q are not necessarily the same.

If p is different from q, then p is inside z (not on the boundary of z). But, just because the point p of x is inside z, it doesn't mean x shares interior points with z. x could just have its boundary passing through the interior of z without x having any interior parts inside z. So, actually, even in this case, the relation between x and z could be EC(x, z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

But there's also the possibility of x having some interior parts inside z, leading to PO(x, z), or being entirely inside z, leading to TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z).

So, the possibilities are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

I'm beginning to go in circles a bit. Let me take another approach.

After reflection, and considering the definitions of the relations, I think the key is to understand the possible situations when EC(x, y) and TPP(y, z).

Given EC(x, y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. And given TPP(y, z), y is inside z, with its boundary touching the boundary of z.

To figure out the possible relations between x and z, I'll think about where x can be relative to z.

CASE 1: x touches y at a point which is on the boundary of z.
In this case, x touches the boundary of z. If x has no interior parts inside z, then EC(x, z). If x has interior parts inside z, then PO(x, z). But wait, if x is entirely inside z, then TPP(x, z) is also a possibility.

CASE 2: x touches y at a point which is inside z (not on the boundary of z).
In this case, at least that point of x is inside z. There are several subcases:
   a. If x has interior parts both inside and outside z, then PO(x, z).
   b. If x is entirely inside z and touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x, z).
   c. If x is entirely inside z and does not touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x, z).

So, in summary, the possible relations are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Ah wait, I think I was mistaken about one thing. In Case 1, I said a possibility is that x is wholly inside z but touches the boundary of z. But that isn't consistent with the premise that x touches y at a point which is on the boundary of z. If x is wholly inside z and touches the boundary of z, and if x touches y at a point which is on the boundary of z, then that means x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z. But is that possible if TPP(y, z) means y has no interior parts that are inside the exterior of z? Let me go back to the definition of touching at the boundary and tangential proper part.

Actually, if TPP(y, z), it means y is wholly inside z, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of z. So, y can have parts inside the exterior of z.

But wait, that doesn't make sense. If y is wholly inside z, then its parts are inside z, not inside the exterior of z.

I think I'm missing something in the definition of TPP.

TPP(y, z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.
This means that y is wholly inside z and has some point of contact with the boundary of z.

Now, EC(x, y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

If x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then:
- If x has interior parts inside z, then PO(x, z).
- If x is wholly inside z, then TPP(x, z).
- If x has no interior parts inside z, then EC(x, z).

I'm reading online, and I see that in the RCC (Region Connection Calculus), the meaning of "interior" and "boundary" can be a bit technical. Specifically, if we have two regions X and Y, and X is a proper part of Y, then the interior of X is always inside the interior of Y. The boundary of X is inside the interior of Y except where the boundary of X touches the boundary of Y.

So, if TPP(y, z), it means y is wholly inside z, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of z at some point.

And if EC(x, y), it means x touches y at the boundary.

So, we have the following cases:

CASE 1: x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z.
In this case, x touches the boundary of z at that point. If x is wholly inside z, then TPP(x, z). If x has parts outside z, then either EC(x, z) or PO(x, z), depending on whether x has interior parts inside z.

CASE 2: x touches y at a point which is on the boundary of y but inside z (not where y touches the boundary of z).
In this case, that point of x is inside z. If x is wholly inside z, then either TPP(x, z) (if x touches the boundary of z elsewhere) or NTPP(x, z) (if x doesn't touch the boundary of z). If x has parts outside z, then PO(x, z).

So, the possible relations are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, let me revisit the definition of EC once more:

EC(x, y) means that x and y "touch", meaning they share boundary points but no interior points.

And let me revisit the definition of the specific RCC-8 relations. 

TPP(y, z) means that the region y is a tangential proper part of the region z, i.e., y is wholly contained in z, and y touches the boundary of z. So the boundary of y touches the boundary of z at at least 1 location.

EC(x, y) means the regions x and y are "externally connected", meaning they touch at the boundary but have no interior parts in common.

With these definitions, let's analyze the question:
EC(x, y) and TPP(y, z), then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

So, y is wholly inside z, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of z at at least one point. 

And x touches y at the boundary, meaning there's at least one point p that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y. 

Now, the point p is either: 
(a) on the boundary of both x and y, and also on the boundary of z (i.e., it's one of the points where y touches the boundary of z), or 
(b) on the boundary of both x and y, but inside the region z.

Let's consider these cases:

Case (a): p is on the boundary of y where y touches the boundary of z.
So, p is a point on the boundaries of x, y, and z. Here, x has three possibilities:

1. x has interior parts inside z, leading to PO(x, z).
2. x is wholly inside z, leading to TPP(x, z).
3. x has no interior parts inside z (it just touches the boundary of z at p), leading to EC(x, z).

Case (b): p is on the boundary of y but inside the region z.
Here, the point p is on the boundaries of x and y, and is inside z. Again, x has three possibilities:

1. x has interior parts inside z, leading to PO(x, z) if x also has interior parts outside z, or to TPP(x, z) if x is wholly inside z and touches the boundary of z at some other point, or NTPP(x, z) if x is wholly inside z but does not touch the boundary of z.
2. x has no interior parts inside z but has a boundary point inside z (the point p), leading to EC(x, z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Let me re-examine the cases in more detail:

Case (a): p is on the boundary of y where y touches the boundary of z.
1. EC(x, z): x touches z at the point p but has no interior parts inside z.
2. PO(x, z): x touches z at p, and x has interior parts both inside and outside z.
3. TPP(x, z): x is wholly inside z and touches the boundary of z at p.

Case (b): p is on the boundary of y but inside the region z.
1. EC(x, z): x touches z but has no interior parts inside z. Is this possible? If the point p is inside the region z, then isn't p in the interior of z? But then, how could x not have an interior part inside z?

Let me quickly check something. I'm considering regions in R^2 (the plane). The boundary of a region is its closure minus its interior. The boundary of a region is a set of dimension 1, so it's a curve or a finite union of curves.

So, when we say that two regions share a boundary point, we mean that they touch at a point on the boundary of both.

In case (b), the point p is on the boundaries of x and y, and is inside the region z. But wait, is it necessary that this means p is in the interior of z?

Actually, yes, by definition. If TPP(y, z), then y is wholly inside z. And if p is on the boundary of y, but not one of the points where y touches the boundary of z, then p is indeed in the interior of z.

So, if p is in the interior of z, then x touches z at an interior point.  

Ah, I see the issue: we're using "touches" in different ways. In RCC8, "touch" means "share a boundary point without sharing an interior point". So, if x touches y at a point p, it means the point p is on the boundary of both x and y, but x and y don't overlap.

Similarly, when we say region A touches the boundary of region B, we mean there are points that are on the boundaries of both A and B.

Given that, let me clarify the case (b): p is on the boundary of y but not at the points where y touches the boundary of z. Since TPP(y, z), the point p is either in the interior of z or is one of the points where y touches the boundary of z. Since we're considering the case where p is not where y touches the boundary of z, p is in the interior of z. So, the point p is on the boundaries of x and y, and is in the interior of z.

In this situation, can the relation between x and z be EC(x, z)? That is, can x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior points?

Since p is on the boundary of x and is inside z, at least that point of x is inside z. But given that we're talking about regions in R^2, the boundary of a region is a continuous curve. So, if part of the boundary of x is inside z, it means x must either have interior parts inside z or be entirely inside z. 

So in case (b), the possibilities for the relation between x and z are:

1. PO(x, z): x has interior parts both inside and outside z.
2. TPP(x, z): x is wholly inside z and touches the boundary of z at some other point.
3. NTPP(x, z): x is wholly inside z and does not touch the boundary of z.

EC(x, z) is not a possibility in case (b).

So, combining the possibilities from case (a) and case (b), the possible relations between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, wait. I need to think this through a bit more.

In case (b), p is on the boundary of y, and y is inside z except where the boundary of y touches the boundary of z. But p is not one of the points where y touches the boundary of z. So p is on the boundary of y, and is in the interior of z.

Now, x touches y at the point p. So, the point p is on the boundary of x. Since p is in the interior of z, what does this tell us about the relation between x and z?

The question is: can x and z be EC without having interior parts inside z if they share a boundary point that's in the interior of z?

Actually, I'm not sure if this is even possible. If p is in the interior of z, and p is on the boundary of x, then part of the boundary of x is in the interior of z. But that doesn't necessarily mean the interior of x has to intersect with the interior of z. It possible for a point on the boundary of x to be in the interior of z without x having any interior parts inside z. This would mean EC(x, z).

But then again, typically in the RCC-8 system, we're talking about regions that are regular closed sets, which means the closure of their interiors. If x and z share a boundary point p, and p is in the interior of z, it's hard to see how x would not have any interior points inside z as well.

Let me revisit this from a different angle. The RCC-8 calculus is based on mereology, which deals with the relation of part to whole, and the relations of spatially overlapping regions.

In mereological terms, EC(x, y) means x and y share boundary points but have no interior overlap.

TPP(y, z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is wholly inside z, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of z.

If y is wholly inside z, and x touches y at the boundary, does that means x has to have interior parts inside z?

I don't think that's necessarily the case. So if we're being strict in terms of mereology, EC(x, z) is a possibility.

Actually, I'm not sure if I'm getting overly technical. Let me just use the definitions directly.

EC(x, y) means x connects with y but there's no part of x that overlaps with y.
TPP(y, z) means every part of y is a part of z, and y connects with the complement of z.

If x connects with y but doesn't overlap with it, and every part of y is a part of z, then what's the relation between x and z?

I think the key concept is that of connection. In the RCC system, C(x, y) means x connects with y, which is a primitive notion. It's often interpreted to mean that the closures of x and y intersect.

EC(x, y) means C(x, y) but not O(x, y), where O(x, y) means x overlaps with y, which is interpreted to mean that the interiors of x and y intersect.

If EC(x, y) and TPP(y, z), then x and y are connected, and y is a proper part of z.

The relation between x and z can be:

1. EC(x, z): x connects with z, but there's no part of x that overlaps with z.
2. PO(x, z): x and z overlap, but neither is a part of the other.
3. TPP(x, z): every part of x is a part of z, and x connects with the complement of z.
4. NTPP(x, z): every part of x is a part of z, and x does not connect with the complement of z.

Given these technical definitions, and considering all possible configurations where EC(x, y) and TPP(y, z), I believe the possible relations between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

I think I'm going in circles a bit, so I'll state my final conclusion based on the definitions of the relations.

Given that EC(x, y) means x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts, and TPP(y, z) means y is wholly inside z, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of z at some points, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. EC(x, z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. This happens when x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, and x doesn't have interior parts inside z.

2. PO(x, z): x and z share interior parts, but neither is wholly contained within the other. This happens when x has interior parts both inside and outside z.

3. TPP(x, z): x is wholly inside z, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. This happens when x is wholly inside z, and x touches the boundary of z at some points.

4. NTPP(x, z): x is wholly inside z, and the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This happens when x is wholly inside z, and there's no point where the boundary of x touches the boundary of z.

In all these scenarios, I'm seeing that DC(x, z), TPPi(x, z), NTPPi(x, z), and EQ(x, z) are not valid options.

### Answer: The possible relations between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Since y is a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)), and x touches y at the boundary (from EC(x,y)), there are several possibilities:

   - EC(x,z): This occurs when x touches z only at its boundary without sharing interior parts. This happens when x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z.

   - PO(x,z): This occurs when x has some interior parts inside z and some outside. This happens when x extends across z's boundary.

   - TPP(x,z): This occurs when x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This can happen when x is contained in z and extends to touch z's boundary.

   - NTPP(x,z): This occurs when x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This can happen when x is contained well within z.

DC(x,z) is impossible because if x touches y and y is part of z, then x must at least touch z.
TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible given the constraints.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
