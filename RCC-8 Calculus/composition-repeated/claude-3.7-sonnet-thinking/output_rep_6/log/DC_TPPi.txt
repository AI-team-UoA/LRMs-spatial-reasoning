PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step by step.

We know:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's visualize this. We have x disconnected from y, and z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given that x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y (touching y's boundary), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, x must be disconnected from z as well. So, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, let me double check this. We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y have no common parts and are not connected.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's visualize:
- y is a region in space.
- x is a region that is disconnected from y, meaning they don't share any parts and don't even touch.
- z is a proper part of y, fully inside y but touching y's boundary.

Given that x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, it follows that x must be disconnected from z. So, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me be more careful. I'm having second thoughts because I realize I might be missing something.

Let's think about this more carefully:

- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any points and don't touch.
- TPPi(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary. z is the exterior region.

Hmm, I think I got confused. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. Let me reanalyze.

We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any points and don't touch.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully inside z, but touches z's boundary.

Given this, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

x is disconnected from y, and y is inside z. So, x is outside of y, and y is inside z. This doesn't conclusively tell us the relationship between x and z. Let's consider the possibilities:

1. x could be disconnected from z (DC).
2. x could be externally connected to z (EC).
3. x could partially overlap with z (PO).
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP).
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).
6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi).
7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi).
8. x and z could be equal (EQ).

Let's eliminate some options:

- x can't be equal to z (EQ) because y is inside z but disconnected from x.
- z can't be a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi) because y is inside z but disconnected from x.
- x can't be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP) because y is inside z, and if x were inside z without touching the boundary, it would overlap with y, contradicting that x and y are disconnected.

That leaves us with DC, EC, PO, and TPP as possibilities for the relationship between x and z.

But wait, I need to be more careful. Let's reconsider what TPPi(y,z) means. It means y is inside z, touching z's boundary. x is disconnected from y, which means x and y don't share any points and don't touch.

If x is disconnected from y, and y is inside z, then:
- x can be outside of z (DC).
- x can touch z from the outside (EC).
- x can overlap with z in some parts, but not overlap with y (PO).
- x can be a tangential proper part of z, not overlapping with y (TPP).

Wait, there are still issues with my analysis. I'm struggling because I'm not fully accounting for the implications of DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's approach this differently. We know:
- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any points and don't touch.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully inside z, but touches z's boundary.

Given that y is inside z and x is disconnected from y, let's consider what this tells us about the relationship between x and z.

One way to visualize this is:
- z is a larger region.
- y is inside z, touching z's boundary.
- x is disconnected from y.

Now, if x is disconnected from y, and y is inside z, where can x be?
- x can be outside of z completely (DC).
- x can touch z from the outside (EC).
- x can overlap with z but not with y (PO).
- x can be inside z but not overlapping with y (TPP or NTPP).

I think these are the possibilities.

Actually, let's think about this more systematically. If y is a tangential proper part of z, it means there are parts of z that are not part of y. x could be in these parts, or outside of z altogether.

Let's go through each RCC-8 relation and check if it's possible for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z. 
   This is possible. x can be completely outside of z, disconnected from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary but doesn't overlap.
   This is possible. x can touch z at a boundary that's not shared with y.

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
   This is possible. x can overlap with parts of z that are not part of y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. x can be inside z, touching z's boundary, without overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. x can be fully inside z, not touching z's boundary, without overlapping with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? If z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z, then y would also be a proper part of x, which contradicts that x and y are disconnected. So, this is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are equal, and y is a proper part of z, then y would also be a proper part of x, which contradicts that x and y are disconnected. So, this is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But wait, I think I haven't been fully accounting for the fact that y is a tangential proper part of z. 

Reconsidering the problem from scratch:

- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any points and don't touch.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully inside z, but touches z's boundary.

Now, the question is: what are the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z?

Let's visualize:
- z is a larger region.
- y is inside z, touching z's boundary.
- x is completely separate from y, not even touching.

Now, where can x be in relation to z?
- x can be outside of z completely (DC).
- x can touch z at a point on z's boundary that's not touched by y (EC).
- x can overlap with z but not with y (PO).
- x can be inside z, touching z's boundary, but not overlapping with y (TPP).
- x can be fully inside z, not touching z's boundary, and not overlapping with y (NTPP).

But can x be a container for z? That would mean z is inside x. But if z is inside x, then y would also be inside x (since y is inside z). This contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, x can't be a container for z, eliminating TPPi and NTPPi.

Can x and z be the same (EQ)? If they were, and y is inside z, then y would be inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, EQ is out.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me double-check this:

- DC(x,z): x is outside of z. This is possible.
- EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary. This is possible, as long as the contact point is not where y touches z.
- PO(x,z): x overlaps with z. This is possible, as long as the overlap doesn't include y.
- TPP(x,z): x is inside z, touching z's boundary. This is possible, as long as x doesn't overlap with y.
- NTPP(x,z): x is fully inside z, not touching the boundary. This is possible, as long as x doesn't overlap with y.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x. Not possible, as it would imply y is inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is fully inside x. Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. Not possible, as it would imply y is inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

I'm now confident that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me double-check the TPP case. If TPP(x,z) is true, it means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. But we also know that y is a tangential proper part of z, also touching z's boundary. The question is: can x and y both be tangential proper parts of z without overlapping or touching each other?

Let's think about it geometrically. Imagine z as a circle. Both x and y are inside this circle, touching the boundary. Can they be arranged in such a way that they don't overlap or touch? Yes, they can be placed at different parts of the boundary, not touching each other.

The same logic applies to NTPP. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z, fully inside without touching the boundary, and still not overlap with y.

So, my answer stands: the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I think I may have been making some of my conclusions based on an intuitive sense of the relations. Let me carefully go through the properties of the RCC-8 relations to verify.

We know:
- DC(x,y): x and y have no common points and are not connected.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is properly contained in z and shares at least one boundary point with z.

Now, I'll use the composition table for RCC-8 relations to determine the possible relations between x and z.

The composition of DC and TPPi is:
DC ∘ TPPi = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}

This means that if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

So, the answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

But let me further verify this with a sanity check. I'll consider scenarios for each of these relations to confirm they're possible:

1. DC(x,z): x is outside of z completely. This is possible because y doesn't take up all of z, and x can be far from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary. This is possible as long as the contact point is not where y touches z. Given that y doesn't cover the entire boundary of z, there are points on z's boundary that are not shared with y, so x can touch z at one of these points.

3. PO(x,z): x overlaps with z. This is possible as long as the overlap doesn't include y. Since y doesn't cover all of z, there are parts of z where x can overlap without touching y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z, touching z's boundary. This is possible as long as x doesn't overlap with y. Given that z is larger than y and y only touches the boundary of z at certain points, x can be placed inside z, touching a different part of z's boundary, without overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is fully inside z, not touching the boundary. This is possible as long as x doesn't overlap with y. Given that y doesn't cover all of z and is tangential to z, there's space inside z away from y where x can be placed.

It seems that all five relations are indeed possible. So, the answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, this actually doesn't seem right. If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), it means x is disconnected from y, and y is a tangential proper part of z. Now, can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)? If x is inside z, touching the boundary, and y is also inside z, touching the boundary, can x and y be disconnected? I need to think more carefully.

The answer to that would be yes, they can be disconnected. For instance, imagine z as a circle. Both x and y can be smaller circles inside z, touching the boundary at different points, without overlapping with each other. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

How about NTPP(x,z)? Can x be fully inside z, not touching the boundary, and still be disconnected from y, which is also inside z, touching the boundary? Again, yes. x can be a small circle inside z, not touching the boundary, and placed far enough from y so that they don't overlap.

I think I've confirmed that all five relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP) are indeed possible for the relationship between x and z. So, I believe this is the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure again. The RCC-8 relation composition table, which provides the possible relations for a composition of two known relations, should give us the answer. 

If we know DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the composition DC ∘ TPPi should tell us the possible relations between x and z.

It appears that the composition DC ∘ TPPi = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP} (I'm not 100% certain). I'm questioning if I have the wrong understanding of TPPi. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Wait, I think I misunderstood TPPi. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. So, z is inside y.

Let me re-approach the problem with this understanding:

We know:
- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any points and don't touch.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained in y and shares at least one boundary point with y.

Given that z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, what can be the relation between x and z? Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z. 

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC.

Actually, this is a direct application of the RCC-8 composition table. The composition of DC and TPPi is DC.

So, the answer is: DC.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me be very clear:

TPPi(y,z) means that y is contained in z, touching the boundary of z. It's the inverse of TPP(z,y).

Given this, if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), it means x is disconnected from y, and y is contained in z. Now, the question is: what can be the relation between x and z?

Let's use the RCC-8 composition table. For the composition DC ∘ TPPi, the result is {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}. 

Actually, I'm not sure if I'm interpreting TPPi correctly, so let me refer to the standard definition:

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Actually, wait. I'm confused because I'm interpreting TPPi in two different ways. Let me clarify:

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. In other words, z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Given this, if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), it means x is disconnected from y, and z is contained in y. Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC.

No, that's not right either. I'm misinterpreting the definition.

To clarify: 
- TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b.
- TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. This is the inverse relation of TPP.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained in y and shares at least one boundary point with y.

I think there's ambiguity in my understanding. Let me try to be very clear and consistent:

- TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. In other words, a is properly contained in b and touches b's boundary.
- TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b), which means TPP(b,a). In other words, b is a tangential proper part of a.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Given this, if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), it means x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y. Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC.

But wait, I think the ambiguity arises from how I'm interpreting the "i" in TPPi. It stands for "inverse", not "inside". So, TPPi(y,z) means the relation is the inverse of TPP, which means TPP(z,y).

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Given this, if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), it means x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y. Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC.

Given the interpretations we've gone through:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and don't share any points.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the answer is: DC.

Actually, let's double-check the definition of TPPi again. I think I keep going in circles because I'm mixing up the reference points.

In the RCC-8 framework:
- TPP(a,b): a is a tangential proper part of b. This means a is properly contained in b and shares at least one boundary point with b.
- TPPi(a,b): b is a tangential proper part of a. This is the inverse of TPP(a,b), which means TPP(b,a).

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained in y and shares at least one boundary point with y.

Given this, if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), it means x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y. Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the answer is: DC.

I will be very careful because I've been getting confused. Let's use the definition from the prompt.

According to the definition from the prompt:
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

And TPP(z,y) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given this, if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), it means x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, touching y's boundary. Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the answer is: DC.

OK let me just check using the composition table (which i don't know by heart, but I can derive from first principles). If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

We're looking for the composition of DC and TPPi.

Let's systematically go through the RCC-8 relations and check if each is a possibility:

1. DC(x,z):
   We have DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which means z is inside y, touching y's boundary. Since x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, x must also be disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z):
   If x is externally connected to z, it means they touch at a boundary but don't share any interior. But z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y. So, x can't touch z. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z):
   If x partially overlaps with z, it means they share a spatial part. But z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y. So, x can't overlap with z. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z):
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x is inside z, touching z's boundary. But z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y. So, x can't be inside z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means x is inside z, not touching z's boundary. But z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y. So, x can't be inside z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, it means z is inside x, touching x's boundary. But z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y. If z were inside x, it would mean there's an overlap between x and y, which contradicts DC(x,y). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, it means z is inside x, not touching x's boundary. But z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y. If z were inside x, it would mean there's an overlap between x and y, which contradicts DC(x,y). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z):
   If x and z are equal, it means they coincide. But z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y. If x and z were the same, it would mean x is inside y, which contradicts DC(x,y). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Based on this analysis, the only possibility is DC(x,z). So, the answer is: DC.

To be sure, let's try a concrete example. Imagine:
- y is a circle.
- z is a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.
- x is a circle outside of y, disconnected from y.

In this scenario, x is also disconnected from z. So, the relation between x and z is DC.

I think I can confidently say that the answer is: DC.

Actually, wait. I'm overthinking this. Let's be very clear. We have DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which means:
- x and y are disconnected (they don't share any spatial parts).
- y is part of z and touches z's boundary (this is what TPPi(y,z) means).

So, y is inside z, and x is disconnected from y. Now, the question is: what can be the relation between x and z?

x is disconnected from y. But y is inside z. Just because x is disconnected from y, it doesn't mean x is disconnected from all of z. Since y is only a part of z, there are parts of z that are not part of y. x could overlap with these parts of z or be a part of these parts of z.

I think I've been misinterpreting the problem.

Given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which means:
- x and y are disconnected.
- y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z.
2. EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z, touching z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is inside z, not touching z's boundary.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because they would imply z is a part of x or equal to x, which would mean y is also at least partially a part of x, contradicting DC(x,y).

So, the answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, wait. I think the issue is how I'm interpreting TPPi(y,z). Let's be very clear:

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. In other words, TPP(z,y) is true, which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

According to the definition from the prompt, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

OK, so we have DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which means:
- x and y are disconnected.
- z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the answer is: DC.

Wait, I keep making the same mistake over and over. Let me see the definition from the prompt again.

According to the given definitions:
TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). In other words, y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

OK, so z is inside y. And x is disconnected from y. Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the answer is: DC.

I went back and forth quite a bit, but I think now I know what the source of the issue is. I've been misinterpreting "TPPi". 

I think the confusion stemmed from the order of the arguments. But the definition is clear: TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). So, z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

And if z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the answer is: DC.

Let me do a thorough check:

According to the prompt:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, z is a part of y. And x is disconnected from y.

Picture this: y is a larger region, z is a smaller region inside y, touching y's boundary, and x is a region disconnected from y. Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the relation between x and z is DC.

I believe this is the correct interpretation.

Wait, I'm stuck in a loop. Let me double-check the definition again.

According to the prompt:
TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

OK, so we have z inside y. And we have x disconnected from y.

If z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the relation between x and z is DC.

Let me think of this in yet another way: the TPPi relation has region z being part of region y but touching y's boundary. So region y strictly contains region z. Region x is disconnected from region y. So region x is outside of region y. So region x is also disconnected from any subregion of region y, which includes region z. 

So x DC z.

However, I'm checking myself because I've been going in circles for a while.

Let's visualize this once more:
- y is a larger region.
- z is a smaller region inside y, touching y's boundary.
- x is a region disconnected from y.

Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the relation between x and z is DC.

Given that I've arrived at the same conclusion multiple times using different approaches, I'm confident that DC is the correct answer.

It may not be obvious, but since y is larger than or equal to z, and x is disconnected from y, it follows that x is also disconnected from any part of y, including z.

It's because if there were any connection or overlap between x and z, since z is inside y, there would also be a connection or overlap between x and y, which contradicts the given that x is disconnected from y.

So, the answer is: DC.

Actually, wait. The definition says TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). So that means z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is inside y, touching y's boundary. And x is disconnected from y. Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must be disconnected from z. So the relation is DC(x,z).

Let me put it diagrammatically:

y is a larger circle.
z is a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.
x is a circle outside of y, disconnected from y.

In this setup, x is also disconnected from z. So, the relation is DC(x,z).

I am now certain that the answer is: DC.

But wait, I'm still confusing myself.

Just to be 100% crystal clear:
- TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b, so a is a sub-region of b and touches b's boundary.
- TPPi(a,b) is the inverse, so TPP(b,a), which means b is a tangential proper part of a. So b is a sub-region of a and touches a's boundary.

Given TPPi(y,z), I'm saying z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

And given DC(x,y), I'm saying x and y are disconnected.

Since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

So, the relation between x and z is DC.

Let me be absolutely sure by consulting the composition table for RCC-8 relations:

For the composition DC ∘ TPPi, the result is DC. This means if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then DC(x,z).

So, the answer is: DC.

ANSWER:

I'll analyze this step-by-step:

First, I need to understand what we know:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- TPPi(y,z): According to the definition, this is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary

To determine the possible relationship between x and z, I need to consider their spatial arrangement:

Since TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y (touching y's boundary), and DC(x,y) means x is completely disconnected from y, we can deduce that x must also be disconnected from z.

This is because z is fully contained within y. If x doesn't share any spatial parts with y (which completely contains z), then x cannot possibly share any spatial parts with z either.
