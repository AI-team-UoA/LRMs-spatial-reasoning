PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's first understand what we're given:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, we need to figure out the possible relations between x and z. Let's think through this.

From TPPi(x,y), we know that y is inside x, and touches x's boundary.
From TPP(y,z), we know that y is inside z, and touches z's boundary.

Let me work through the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This would mean x and z don't share any parts. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors. But again, y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is a possibility. Since y is part of both x and z, there's at least some overlap. And since y touches the boundary of both x and z, it's possible that x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in others, resulting in a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This means x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. If y is at the boundary of x, and y is also at the boundary of z, then x could be completely inside z, with its boundary touching z's boundary at y (or the region where y is).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This means x is fully contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible. Since y touches the boundary of both x and z, and y is inside x, then x must also touch the boundary of z at least at the point or region where y does. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This means z is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is a possibility. If y is at the boundary of x, and y is also at the boundary of z, then z could be completely inside x, with its boundary touching x's boundary at y (or the region where y is).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This means z is fully contained within x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This doesn't seem possible. Since y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then z must also touch the boundary of x at least at the point or region where y does. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident: This means x and z are exactly the same. This is a possibility. If y is at the boundary of both x and z, and x and z are the same, then y would be a tangential proper part of both.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try again more carefully:

We know:
- TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, if y is inside both x and z, and touches the boundary of both, there are several scenarios:

1. x and z partially overlap (PO): This is possible. If x and z share the region y, and both extend beyond y in different directions, they would partially overlap.

2. x is inside z (TPP or NTPP): If x is inside z, and y is inside x and touches the boundary of both, then x must also touch the boundary of z at least where y does. So, TPP(x,z) is possible, but NTPP(x,z) is not.

3. z is inside x (TPPi or NTPPi): Similarly, if z is inside x, and y is inside z and touches the boundary of both, then z must also touch the boundary of x at least where y does. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible, but NTPPi(x,z) is not.

4. x and z are coincident (EQ): This is also possible. If x and z are the same, and y is a tangential proper part of both, then TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would both be true.

But wait, I'm still not sure about my reasoning for NTPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is inside x and touches x's boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these conditions, if z is inside x, can z be completely surrounded by x's interior, i.e., NTPPi(x,z)?
If z is inside x, and y is inside z, and y touches the boundary of both x and z, then z must also touch the boundary of x where y does. This would make TPPi(x,z) true, not NTPPi(x,z).

Similarly, if x is inside z, can x be completely surrounded by z's interior, i.e., NTPP(x,z)?
If x is inside z, and y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of both x and z, then x must also touch the boundary of z where y does. This would make TPP(x,z) true, not NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,z) (x and z are coincident)

Actually, wait. I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at this from a visual perspective.

In TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
In TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these constraints, let's consider the possible configurations of x and z:

1. If x and z are completely separate (DC), they wouldn't share y. This contradicts our given information, so DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. If x and z only touch at a boundary (EC), they wouldn't share an interior point. But since y is inside both x and z, they must share interior points. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. If x and z partially overlap (PO), where neither is fully contained in the other, this is consistent with our given information. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. If x is fully contained in z (TPP or NTPP), we need to determine if x touches z's boundary. Since y touches the boundary of both x and z, and y is inside x, then x must also touch z's boundary at the point or region where y does. This means TPP(x,z) is possible, but NTPP(x,z) is not.

5. If z is fully contained in x (TPPi or NTPPi), we apply the same logic. Since y touches the boundary of both x and z, and y is inside z, then z must also touch x's boundary at the point or region where y does. This means TPPi(x,z) is possible, but NTPPi(x,z) is not.

6. If x and z are coincident (EQ), this is also consistent with our given information. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,z) (x and z are coincident)

Actually, I think I need to be a bit more precise about this. Let's try to reason about it more systematically.

We have TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). 

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is inside z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Let's reason through each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z don't share any parts. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they can't be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors. But we know y is inside both x and z, so they must share interiors. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. We know y is part of both x and z, so they do share some parts. If x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in others, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This means x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. If y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, then x must also touch the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This means x is fully contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, x must also touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This means z is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary. If y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then z must also touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This means z is fully contained within x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Since y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, z must also touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident: This means x and z are exactly the same. If x and z are the same, and y is a tangential proper part of both, then TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would both be true. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,z) (x and z are coincident)

Let's double-check these findings by considering some concrete examples or visualizations for each possible relation.

For PO(x,z):
Imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, with y as a smaller circle that's inside both x and z, and touches the boundary of both. This is a valid configuration, confirming that PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z, and y as an even smaller circle inside x. Both x and y touch the boundary of z, and y also touches the boundary of x. This is a valid configuration, confirming that TPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
This is the reverse of the above. Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside x, and y as an even smaller circle inside z. Both z and y touch the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of z. This is a valid configuration, confirming that TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z):
Imagine x and z as the same circle, and y as a smaller circle inside both, touching the boundary. This is a valid configuration, confirming that EQ(x,z) is possible.

For the other relations:
- DC(x,z): As explained, this contradicts the fact that y is inside both x and z.
- EC(x,z): This also contradicts the fact that y is inside both x and z.
- NTPP(x,z): If x is inside z, and y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of z, then x must also touch the boundary of z, making it TPP(x,z) not NTPP(x,z).
- NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is inside x, and y is inside z, and y touches the boundary of x, then z must also touch the boundary of x, making it TPPi(x,z) not NTPPi(x,z).

So, I believe my answer is correct. The possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,z) (x and z are coincident)

Actually, wait. I think I missed an important detail. When we say TPP(y,x), we mean y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x, y touches the boundary of x, and y is a proper part of x (i.e., y ≠ x). Similarly, TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, y touches the boundary of z, and y ≠ z.

Given these constraints, I don't think EQ(x,z) is possible. If x and z are coincident (i.e., x = z), then y can't be a tangential proper part of both. If y is a tangential proper part of x, and x = z, then y is a tangential proper part of z. But this would make y = y, which contradicts the definition of a proper part.

Actually, no, I'm getting confused here. The "proper part" in TPP just means that y is not the same as x (or z). It doesn't say anything about the relationship between x and z. If x and z are the same, then y can still be a tangential proper part of both. So, EQ(x,z) is still possible.

So, my answer stands. The possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,z) (x and z are coincident)

Actually, let me think about this one more time. 

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x, touching x's boundary, and y ≠ x.
If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z, touching z's boundary, and y ≠ z.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z don't share any parts. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they can't be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors. But we know y is inside both x and z, so they must share interiors. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. We know y is part of both x and z, so they do share some parts. If x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in others, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This means x is fully contained within z, x touches z's boundary, and x ≠ z. If y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, then x must also touch the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This means x is fully contained within z, x doesn't touch z's boundary, and x ≠ z. Since y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, x must also touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This means z is fully contained within x, z touches x's boundary, and z ≠ x. If y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then z must also touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This means z is fully contained within x, z doesn't touch x's boundary, and z ≠ x. Since y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, z must also touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident: This means x and z are exactly the same. If x and z are the same, then y can be a tangential proper part of both. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,z) (x and z are coincident)

So, my answer is consistent. The possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually I want to double check EQ(x,z) once more. Saying "EQ(x,z)" means "x and z are coincident" or "x and z are exactly the same". Let's think about it: if x and z are the same region, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is also a tangential proper part of z. So if we have TPPi(x,y) (which is equivalent to TPP(y,x)) and TPP(y,z), and x and z are the same region, then we have TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z), which is consistent. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Let's double-check once more with a concrete example:
Imagine a square x (which is the same as z), and a smaller square y inside it, with one side of y coinciding with one side of x (which is the same as z). In this case, TPPi(x,y) (or TPP(y,x)) and TPP(y,z) would both be true, and x and z are the same (EQ(x,z)).

So my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) (partially overlapping)
- TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z)
- TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,z) (x and z are coincident)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) tell us.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is inside x
- y touches x's boundary
- y is not equal to x

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is inside z
- y touches z's boundary
- y is not equal to z

Let me evaluate each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible since y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least some region.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible since y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap, sharing region y while each extends beyond the other in different directions.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be wholly contained in z and touch z's boundary (since y touches z's boundary and is contained in x).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - if y touches the boundary of z and is contained in x, then x must also touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be wholly contained in x and touch x's boundary (since y touches x's boundary and is contained in z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - if y touches the boundary of x and is contained in z, then z must also touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be identical, with y as a tangential proper part of both.
