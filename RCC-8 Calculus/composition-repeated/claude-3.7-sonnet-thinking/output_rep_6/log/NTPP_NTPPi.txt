PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step by step.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x does not touch y's boundary. So x is completely contained within the interior of y.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and z does not touch y's boundary. So z is completely contained within the interior of y.

Now, I need to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints.

Let's go through each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part
6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal

Given that both x and z are completely within the interior of y, x and z cannot be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC) because they are both contained within y.

x and z can partially overlap (PO), meaning they share some common parts but neither is completely contained in the other.

x can be a tangential proper part of z (TPP) if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

x can be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP) if x is completely contained in z and does not touch z's boundary.

z can be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi) if z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary.

z can be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi) if z is completely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary.

x and z can be equal (EQ) if they coincide exactly.

Actually, wait. I need to consider more carefully what the given relations tell us about the relative positioning of x and z within y.

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely within the interior of y.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely within the interior of y.

So both x and z are completely within the interior of y, but their relationship to each other is not directly constrained by the given information.

Let me reconsider the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be separate regions within the interior of y.
2. EC(x,z) - Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries while both being within the interior of y.
3. PO(x,z) - Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share some common parts without either being completely contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, x can be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, x can be completely contained in z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z can be completely contained in x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z can be completely contained in x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - Can x and z be equal? Yes, they can coincide exactly.

Actually, I think I need to be a bit more careful about this. Let me think again.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and z does not touch y's boundary.

So both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. But this doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between x and z.

Let me try to reason about each possible relation again:

1. DC(x,z) - Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be separate regions within the interior of y.
2. EC(x,z) - Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries while both being within the interior of y.
3. PO(x,z) - Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share some common parts without either being completely contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, x can be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, x can be completely contained in z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z can be completely contained in x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z can be completely contained in x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - Can x and z be equal? Yes, they can coincide exactly.

I think all of these relations are possible given the constraints. Let me double-check if I'm missing any constraints.

Wait, let me try to visualize this more clearly. If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then:
- x is completely within the interior of y
- z contains y completely, and y does not touch z's boundary

So y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that y is completely contained within the interior of z.

Now, if x is completely within the interior of y, and y is completely within the interior of z, then x is completely within the interior of z. This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

So the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I misunderstood the relation NTPPi(y,z). Let me clarify.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and z does not touch y's boundary. So z is completely contained within the interior of y.

So now we have:
- x is completely within the interior of y
- z is completely within the interior of y

Given these constraints, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be separate regions within the interior of y.
2. EC(x,z) - Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries while both being within the interior of y.
3. PO(x,z) - Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share some common parts without either being completely contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, x can be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, x can be completely contained in z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z can be completely contained in x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z can be completely contained in x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - Can x and z be equal? Yes, they can coincide exactly.

So it seems like all relations are possible. However, I'm not sure if I'm missing some constraint. Let me try to reason about this more carefully.

Actually, I think I should try again to understand what NTPPi(y,z) means.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). So if NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So x is within y, and z is within y. But the relationship between x and z is not directly constrained.

Let's go through the possibilities again:

1. DC(x,z) - Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be separate regions within y.
2. EC(x,z) - Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries within y.
3. PO(x,z) - Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share some common parts within y.
4. TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, if z contains x and x touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, if z contains x and x doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if x contains z and z touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if x contains z and z doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - Can x and z be equal? Yes, if they coincide exactly.

So it seems like all relations are possible.

Wait, I think I'm still not getting this right. Let me try to understand the given relations more clearly.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely contained within the interior of y, and x does not touch y's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, or NTPP(z,y). So z is completely contained within the interior of y, and z does not touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- x is completely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- z is completely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Given these constraints, x and z are both within the interior of y, but their relationship to each other is not directly constrained. Let's go through the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be separate regions within the interior of y.
2. EC(x,z) - Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries while both being within the interior of y.
3. PO(x,z) - Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share some common parts without either being completely contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, x can be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, x can be completely contained in z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z can be completely contained in x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z can be completely contained in x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - Can x and z be equal? Yes, they can coincide exactly.

So all eight relations are possible.

Actually, I think I need to be even more precise with my understanding. Let's go back to the definitions.

Here are the RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,y) - Disconnected: x and y share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y) - Externally connected: x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y) - Partially overlapping: x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y) - Tangential proper part: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y) - Non-tangential proper part: x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y) - Tangential proper part inverse: y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y) - Equal: x and y are coincident.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, or NTPP(z,y).

So:
- x is completely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- z is completely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let's go through each relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be separate regions within the interior of y.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Can x and z touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries within the interior of y.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Can x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other? Yes, they can partially overlap within the interior of y.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Can x be part of z and touch z's boundary? Yes, x can be contained within z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Can x be part of z but not touch z's boundary? Yes, x can be completely contained within the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: Can z be part of x and touch x's boundary? Yes, z can be contained within x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Can z be part of x but not touch x's boundary? Yes, z can be completely contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Can x and z be coincident? Yes, they can be the same region.

So, all eight relations are possible between x and z given the constraints NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Actually, I just realized a small issue. I need to be more careful about the exact definition of the relations. Let me double-check to ensure I've understood them correctly.

For NTPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y, which means x is fully contained within y, and x does not touch y's boundary.

For NTPPi(y,z), this is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, or NTPP(z,y). So, z is fully contained within y, and z does not touch y's boundary.

I think my previous analysis is correct. Both x and z are fully contained within y and do not touch y's boundary. But their relationship to each other is not directly constrained.

Actually, let me take a step back and think more abstractly about this. Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), here are some thoughts:

1. x and z are both completely within the interior of y.
2. x and z can be disconnected, meaning they don't share any spatial parts.
3. x and z can be externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
4. x and z can partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither is part of the other.
5. x can be a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
6. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
7. z can be a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
8. z can be a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
9. x and z can be equal, meaning they are coincident.

All of these are possible because NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y) only constrain x and z to be within the interior of y, not their relationship to each other.

Oh, I see the mistake in my previous reasoning. NTPPi(y,z) doesn't mean NTPP(z,y). It means NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. 

Let's redefine our setup:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So:
- x is completely within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- y is completely within the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given this, x is completely within the interior of y, which is completely within the interior of z. This means x is completely within the interior of z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary (because even if x touches y's boundary, y doesn't touch z's boundary). This means NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

To double check, let's go through each relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected? No, x is within z, so they share spatial parts.
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Can x and z touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts? No, x is within the interior of z, so they share interior parts.
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Can x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other? No, x is fully contained within z.
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Can x be part of z and touch z's boundary? No, x doesn't touch z's boundary because x is within y, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Can x be part of z but not touch z's boundary? Yes, x is completely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: Can z be part of x and touch x's boundary? No, z contains x, so it's not a part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Can z be part of x but not touch x's boundary? No, z contains x, so it's not a part of x.
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Can x and z be coincident? No, x is strictly smaller than z because x is within y, and y is strictly smaller than z.

So, given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I see the mistake. NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse of NTPP(y,z). So if NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

This means:
- x is completely within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- z is completely within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given this, x and z are both completely within the interior of y, but their relationship to each other is not directly constrained.

I need to go carefully through the definitions again to make sure I've understood. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In the context of RCC-8, this means x is fully contained within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). In RCC-8, the inverse of a relation R(a,b) is the relation R^{-1}(b,a) such that R^{-1}(b,a) if and only if R(a,b). So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is fully contained within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Alright, I think I've been making a mistake. Let me clarify once more:

RCC-8 Relations:
1. DC(x,y) - Disconnected: x and y share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y) - Externally connected: x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y) - Partially overlapping: x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y) - Tangential proper part: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y) - Non-tangential proper part: x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y) - Tangential proper part inverse: y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y) - Equal: x and y are coincident.

From these definitions:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means y is a proper part inverse of z, which essentially means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) mean:
- x is completely within the interior of y.
- z is completely within the interior of y.

Now, I'll determine what relations are possible between x and z.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be separate regions within the interior of y.
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Can x and z touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries while both being within the interior of y.
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Can x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other? Yes, they can partially overlap within the interior of y.
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Can x be part of z and touch z's boundary? Yes, x can be contained within z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Can x be part of z but not touch z's boundary? Yes, x can be completely contained within the interior of z.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: Can z be part of x and touch x's boundary? Yes, z can be contained within x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Can z be part of x but not touch x's boundary? Yes, z can be completely contained within the interior of x.
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Can x and z be coincident? Yes, they can be the same region.

So, all eight relations are possible between x and z given the constraints NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Actually, now I'm less certain. Let me try again to make sure I understand what NTPPi means.

Given the RCC-8 relations:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part inverse of y, which is the same as NTPP(y,x).

So NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we have:
- x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, but their relationship to each other is not directly constrained.

Let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be separate regions within the interior of y.
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Can x and z touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries while both being within the interior of y.
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Can x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other? Yes, they can partially overlap within the interior of y.
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Can x be part of z and touch z's boundary? Yes, x can be contained within z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Can x be part of z but not touch z's boundary? Yes, x can be completely contained within the interior of z.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: Can z be part of x and touch x's boundary? Yes, z can be contained within x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Can z be part of x but not touch x's boundary? Yes, z can be completely contained within the interior of x.
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Can x and z be coincident? Yes, they can be the same region.

So, all eight relations are possible between x and z given the constraints NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

I'm confident now. Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Both x and z are completely contained within the interior of y and do not touch y's boundary. But their relationship to each other is not directly constrained.

Therefore, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Hmm, actually let me double check this with visual intuition. 

If NTPP(x, y) and NTPP(z, y), then:
- x is fully inside y
- z is fully inside y
- Their relation could be any of the 8 RCC-8 relations. For instance:
  - DC(x, z): If x and z are disjoint regions inside y.
  - EC(x, z): If x and z touch at their boundaries inside y.
  - PO(x, z): If x and z share some interior points but neither is contained in the other.
  - TPP(x, z): If x is contained in z and touches z's boundary.
  - NTPP(x, z): If x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary.
  - TPPi(x, z): If z is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
  - NTPPi(x, z): If z is fully inside x without touching x's boundary.
  - EQ(x, z): If x and z are the same region.

Yes, all 8 relations are possible.

Alright, to summarize:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which means NTPP(z,y)), both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. Their relationship to each other is not directly constrained by these given relations.

Therefore, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) tell us about the relationship between x and z.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y). So z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Given these constraints:
- x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)

Since both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, but their relationship to each other is not directly constrained, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z:

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
