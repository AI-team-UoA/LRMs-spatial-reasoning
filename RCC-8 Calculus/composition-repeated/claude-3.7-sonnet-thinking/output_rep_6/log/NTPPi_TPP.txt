PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to analyze what happens when NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both hold, and determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let's first recall what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y does not touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches z's boundary.

So we know:
1. y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

Now I need to determine what this tells us about the relationship between x and z.

From the conditions:
- x contains y completely (y is a non-tangential proper part of x)
- z contains y, and y touches z's boundary

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is impossible because both x and z contain y, so they must share at least the region occupied by y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is impossible because both x and z contain y, so they must overlap, not just touch at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is possible. x and z both contain y, but x might extend outside z in some areas, and z might extend outside x in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This is possible. x contains y, and x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This is impossible. Since y touches z's boundary and y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), x must also touch z's boundary if x is contained in z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible. z contains y, and z could be completely inside x while touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is impossible. Since y touches z's boundary, and y is inside x, z must touch x's boundary if z is contained in x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x equals z: This is impossible. If x equals z, then y would either touch both of their boundaries or neither. But we know y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

So the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
- Can x be completely contained within z? Yes, this is possible.
- Would x touch z's boundary? Yes, because y touches z's boundary and y is inside x (not touching x's boundary), so x must extend at least to where y touches z's boundary.
So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
- Can z be completely contained within x? If z is completely contained within x, then z's boundary would be completely inside or touching x's boundary.
- Since y touches z's boundary and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), then z's boundary must be partly strictly inside x.
- But this means z cannot be completely contained within x (if it were, its boundary would be completely inside or touching x's boundary).
So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me rethink this. If z is completely contained within x, then z's boundary is completely inside or touching x's boundary. Since y touches z's boundary and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), this implies that the part of z's boundary that y touches must be strictly inside x, not touching x's boundary. But then z's boundary wouldn't be completely touching x's boundary, which means z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, not a tangential proper part.

Wait, that's not right either. Let me try a different approach.

Let's think carefully about what we know:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z), which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary:
- z contains y (since TPP(y,z))
- x contains y (since NTPPi(x,y))
- Can z be completely contained within x? Yes, this is possible.
- Would z touch x's boundary? Not necessarily. We know y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary. This means z could be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

Actually, I need to consider that TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary from the inside. Since y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, the part of z's boundary that y touches must also be inside x without touching x's boundary. So if z is contained within x, it might not touch x's boundary.

Let's take a step back and think more systematically.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

We're looking for the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's draw this out:
- x is a region
- y is a region completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- y is also inside z, touching z's boundary from the inside

From this, we can say:
- x and z definitely overlap (they both contain y)
- x is not necessarily contained in z (x could extend beyond z)
- z is not necessarily contained in x (z could extend beyond x)

So the possible relations are:
1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
4. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical.

Actually, I don't think EQ(x,z) is possible. If x and z were identical, then y would either touch both of their boundaries or neither. But we know y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

Let's also check TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) more carefully:

For TPP(x,z) (x is contained in z and touches z's boundary):
- We know y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- We know y touches z's boundary.
- If x is inside z, then the part of z's boundary that y touches must be accessible from within x. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, x must extend to the part of z's boundary that y touches. So x would touch z's boundary.
- So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z) (z is contained in x and touches x's boundary):
- We know y is inside z, touching z's boundary.
- We know y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- The part of z's boundary that y touches must be inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means at least part of z's boundary is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- But for TPPi(x,z) to hold, z's boundary must touch x's boundary. This seems contradictory.

Wait, I'm overthinking this. For TPPi(x,z), z can touch x's boundary at some points while having other parts of its boundary inside x. The fact that y touches z's boundary at a point that's inside x (not touching x's boundary) doesn't prevent z from also touching x's boundary at other points.

So TPPi(x,z) is also possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually let me double-check these further:

For TPP(x,z) (x is contained in z and touches z's boundary):
- Is it possible for x to be completely contained in z? Yes, this doesn't contradict anything we know.
- Would x touch z's boundary? Since y touches z's boundary and y is inside x, it means that x must extend at least to where y touches z's boundary. So x would touch z's boundary.
So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me rethink this. If TPP(y,z), then y touches z's boundary at some point p. Since y is completely inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), this point p is also inside x. But if x is completely inside z (TPP(x,z)), then x must touch z's boundary. Can x touch z's boundary at p? No, because p is inside x, not on x's boundary.

But x could touch z's boundary at another point. So TPP(x,z) is still possible. I just need to be careful about the exact points of contact.

For TPPi(x,z) (z is contained in x and touches x's boundary):
- Is it possible for z to be completely contained in x? Yes, this doesn't contradict anything we know.
- Would z touch x's boundary? This is less clear. We know y touches z's boundary at some point q. We also know y doesn't touch x's boundary. So q is inside x, not on x's boundary.

If all of z is inside x, and z touches x's boundary at some point r, then r is on both z's boundary and x's boundary. But r is different from q, since q is inside x, not on x's boundary.

This is a valid configuration, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap):
- Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? Yes, they could both extend beyond their common area.
- They both contain y, so they definitely overlap.
- There's no requirement that one must be contained in the other.
So PO(x,z) is possible.

I can actually make one more observation: NTPP(x,z) might be possible.

For NTPP(x,z) (x is contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary):
- Is it possible for x to be completely contained in z without touching z's boundary? Let's check.
- We know y touches z's boundary at some point p.
- We know y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- So p is inside x, not on x's boundary.
- But if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then how can y, which is inside x, touch z's boundary? This seems contradictory.

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me think about one more: NTPPi(x,z) (z is contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary).

For NTPPi(x,z):
- Is it possible for z to be completely contained in x without touching x's boundary? Let's check.
- We know y touches z's boundary at some point q.
- We know y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- So q is inside x, not on x's boundary.
- If all of z, including its boundary, is inside x without touching x's boundary, then this is a valid configuration.

So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me double-check NTPP(x,z) again. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But this contradicts TPP(y,z), which says y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me also double-check NTPPi(x,z). If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, then y is inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, one of my arguments doesn't sound right. Let me be absolutely clear.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

We want to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's start with the simplest deductions:
- x and z both contain y, so they must overlap.
- This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Now, let's consider each of the remaining RCC-8 relations:

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, but neither is contained in the other.
- This is possible. x and z both contain y, but x might extend outside z in some areas, and z might extend outside x in other areas.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- Is this possible? We know y is inside x, not touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary. If x is completely inside z, then the part of z's boundary that y touches must be accessible from within x. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, x must extend to the part of z's boundary that y touches. So x would touch z's boundary. This is a valid configuration, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- Is this possible? We know y touches z's boundary and y is inside x. If x is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y, which is inside x, can't touch z's boundary. This contradicts TPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
- Is this possible? We know y is inside z, touching z's boundary, and y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. If z is completely inside x, then the part of z's boundary that y touches must be inside x, not touching x's boundary. But for TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must touch x's boundary at some point. These are not contradictory requirements; z can touch x's boundary at some points while having other parts of its boundary inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Is this possible? We know y touches z's boundary at some point and y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. If all of z, including its boundary, is inside x without touching x's boundary, then this is a valid configuration. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z): x and z are identical.
- Is this possible? If x and z were identical, then y would either touch both of their boundaries or neither. But we know y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me double-check my reasoning for NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z):
- NTPP(x,z) means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- We know y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)).
- If x is inside z without touching z's boundary, then how can y, which is inside x, touch z's boundary? This is a contradiction.
- So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- NTPPi(x,z) means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- We know y is inside x without touching x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)).
- If z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then z's boundary, including the part that y touches, is inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with what we know.
- So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So my analysis seems correct. The possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check NTPPi(x,z) by drawing it out conceptually:

1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.
3. NTPPi(x,z) would mean: z is inside x, not touching x's boundary.

If z is inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, then y is inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, let me double-check TPP(x,z) as well:

1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.
3. TPP(x,z) would mean: x is inside z, touching z's boundary.

If x is inside z touching z's boundary, and y is inside x not touching x's boundary, can y touch z's boundary? 

Let's think about this spatially: If y is inside x not touching x's boundary, then y is "buffered" from the outside of x. If x touches z's boundary, then x has at least one point on z's boundary. But y, being buffered from the outside of x, cannot reach z's boundary through x. So if y touches z's boundary (as stated in TPP(y,z)), it seems that x cannot be completely inside z. This would suggest that TPP(x,z) is not possible.

But there's another way to think about it: If x touches z's boundary at one point, and y touches z's boundary at another point, and y is inside x without touching x's boundary, then x must extend beyond y to reach z's boundary. This doesn't contradict y also touching z's boundary at a different point.

Hmm, I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct. Let me try to be more explicit.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z, touching z's boundary. The question is: Can y be inside x, not touching x's boundary, and also touch z's boundary?

Let's say y touches z's boundary at point p. Since y is inside x without touching x's boundary, p is inside x. If x is inside z touching z's boundary, then x touches z's boundary at some point q. But p is also on z's boundary. If p is inside x and on z's boundary, and x is inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at p. But if y touches z's boundary at p, and y is inside x without touching x's boundary, then p cannot be on x's boundary. This seems contradictory.

So it seems TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I think I need to be more careful about the exact meaning of "touching" in this context.

In RCC-8, "touching" means sharing at least one point on the boundary. So if y touches z's boundary, it means there's at least one point p that is both on y's boundary and on z's boundary.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means y's boundary doesn't share any points with x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary. This means y's boundary shares at least one point with z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z, touching z's boundary. This means x's boundary shares at least one point with z's boundary.

Now, if y touches z's boundary at point p, then p is on both y's boundary and z's boundary. Since y is inside x without touching x's boundary, p is on y's boundary but not on x's boundary. But p is on z's boundary. If x is inside z touching z's boundary, and p is on z's boundary, can p be inside x without being on x's boundary?

Actually, I don't think there's a contradiction. Here's why:

Imagine a scenario where:
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary
- z is a large donut shape that surrounds x but doesn't completely contain it
- x touches the inner boundary of the donut z
- y also touches the inner boundary of the donut z, but at a different point than where x touches it

In this scenario:
- y is inside x, not touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y))
- y is inside z, touching z's boundary (TPP(y,z))
- x is partially overlapping with z, not completely inside it (PO(x,z))

This shows that TPP(x,z) is not possible if NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both hold.

Actually, I don't think my example is correct. In that example, x is not inside z, so it's not TPP(x,z). Let me try a different approach.

Let's consider the spatial implications more carefully:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

Let's say y touches z's boundary at point p. Since y is inside x without touching x's boundary, p is inside x (not on x's boundary).

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z, touching z's boundary at some point q. Now, p is on z's boundary and inside x. If x is inside z, then x's boundary must be either inside z or on z's boundary. Since p is inside x, it can't be on x's boundary. But p is on z's boundary. If x's boundary is inside z, how can p, which is inside x, be on z's boundary? This seems contradictory.

But I need to be careful here. The point p could be inside x but not on x's boundary, and still be on z's boundary. This doesn't imply x's boundary is inside z.

I think I'm being too rigid in my thinking. Let me try a different approach.

In RCC-8, regions are considered to be "regular closed sets." This means a region consists of its interior and its boundary. Two regions "touch" if their boundaries share at least one point. If region A is "inside" region B, it means A is a proper subset of B.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and y's boundary doesn't share any points with x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a proper subset of z, and y's boundary shares at least one point with z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper subset of z, and x's boundary would share at least one point with z's boundary.

Now, if y's boundary shares a point p with z's boundary, and y is a proper subset of x with y's boundary not sharing any points with x's boundary, then p is on y's boundary and z's boundary but not on x's boundary. If x is a proper subset of z, then x's boundary can't extend beyond z's boundary. But p is on z's boundary and inside x. This implies p is on x's boundary, which contradicts our assumption that y's boundary doesn't share any points with x's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

Imagine x, y, and z as concentric circles with y inside x inside z. If y touches z's boundary, it means y extends all the way to z's boundary. But if y is inside x without touching x's boundary, then y can't extend all the way to z's boundary (which is beyond x's boundary). This contradiction shows that TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I don't think I have that right. 

Let's look at the implications.

From NTPPi(x,y), we know y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. So y's interior is a subset of x's interior.

From TPP(y,z), we know y is inside z, touching z's boundary. So there's at least one point p that is both on y's boundary and on z's boundary. Since y is inside x without touching x's boundary, p is inside x, not on x's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be inside z, touching z's boundary. So there would be at least one point q that is both on x's boundary and on z's boundary.

Let's look at the point p: it's on y's boundary, on z's boundary, and inside x but not on x's boundary. If x is inside z, then x's boundary can't extend beyond z's boundary. But p is on z's boundary and inside x. This is only possible if p is on x's boundary as well. But that contradicts NTPPi(x,y), which says y doesn't touch x's boundary.

So it seems TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning one more time:

Given: 
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means there's no point that is both on y's boundary and on x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary. This means there's at least one point p that is both on y's boundary and on z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z, touching z's boundary. This means there's at least one point q that is both on x's boundary and on z's boundary.

Let's analyze point p: it's on y's boundary, on z's boundary, and inside x but not on x's boundary (since y doesn't touch x's boundary). If x is inside z touching z's boundary, and p is on z's boundary inside x, then x must touch z's boundary at p. But that means p is on x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y).

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me rethink this. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- Every point of x is a point of z (x is a subset of z).
- There's at least one point of z that's not a point of x (z is not a subset of x).
- There's at least one point that's both on x's boundary and on z's boundary (x touches z's boundary).

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means every point of y is a point of x, and y's boundary doesn't share any points with x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary. This means every point of y is a point of z, and y's boundary shares at least one point with z's boundary.

Let's say y touches z's boundary at point p. Since y is inside x without touching x's boundary, p is inside x (not on x's boundary).

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z, touching z's boundary at some point q. Now, p is on z's boundary and inside x. Since x is inside z, x's boundary can't extend beyond z's boundary. So if p is on z's boundary and inside x, p must also be on x's boundary. But that contradicts NTPPi(x,y), which says y doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually I'm being sloppy. I need to distinguish the interior of a region from the boundary of the region. If y is inside x without touching x's boundary, it means every point of y (including its boundary) is a point of the interior of x. The boundary of a region is not part of its interior.

Let me see if this helps, because I'm not clear on this point.

Alright, let's think more carefully about the boundary of a region.

In RCC-8, regions are regular closed sets. A region consists of its interior and its boundary. Two regions "touch" if their boundaries share at least one point. If region A is "inside" region B, it means A is a proper subset of B.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and y's boundary doesn't share any points with x's boundary. This means every point of y, including its boundary, is either in the interior of x or on x's boundary. But since y's boundary doesn't share any points with x's boundary, every point of y's boundary must be in the interior of x.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a proper subset of z, and y's boundary shares at least one point with z's boundary. This means every point of y, including its boundary, is either in the interior of z or on z's boundary. And there's at least one point p that is both on y's boundary and on z's boundary.

Let's think about point p: it's on y's boundary and on z's boundary. Since y's boundary doesn't share any points with x's boundary, p is in the interior of x.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper subset of z, and x's boundary would share at least one point with z's boundary. This means every point of x, including its boundary, is either in the interior of z or on z's boundary. And there's at least one point q that is both on x's boundary and on z's boundary.

Here's the crucial observation: If p is on z's boundary and in the interior of x, and x is a proper subset of z, then x's boundary must touch z's boundary at p. But that would make p a point on x's boundary, which contradicts our earlier deduction that p is in the interior of x.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I think I've been unclear in my reasoning. Let's delineate this precisely.

In RCC-8, a region consists of its interior (the "inside" points) and its boundary (the "edge" points). Two regions "touch" if their boundaries share at least one point. Region A is "inside" region B if A is a proper subset of B (every point of A is a point of B, and there's at least one point of B that's not a point of A).

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means every point of y (both interior and boundary) is inside the interior of x. In particular, no point of y's boundary is on x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary. This means every point of y is inside z, and there's at least one point p that is both on y's boundary and on z's boundary.

From (1) and (2), we can deduce: p is on y's boundary, on z's boundary, and inside the interior of x.

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z, touching z's boundary. This means every point of x is inside z, and there's at least one point q that is both on x's boundary and on z's boundary.

Let's now think about the relationship between p and q. We know p is on z's boundary and inside the interior of x. If q is on both x's boundary and z's boundary, then q is not inside the interior of x. So p and q are different points.

But here's the issue: If x is inside z, and p is on z's boundary and inside the interior of x, then x's boundary must intersect z's boundary at p. This would make p a point on x's boundary, which contradicts the deduction that p is inside the interior of x.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I don't think that's right. Let me try again.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means every point of y is inside x, and no point of y's boundary is on x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary. This means every point of y is inside z, and there's at least one point p that is both on y's boundary and on z's boundary.

From (1) and (2), we can deduce: p is on y's boundary, on z's boundary, and inside x but not on x's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z, touching z's boundary. This means every point of x is inside z, and there's at least one point q that is both on x's boundary and on z's boundary.

The question is: Can p and q be different points? If they can, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

If x is inside z, then x's boundary can't extend beyond z's boundary. Since p is on z's boundary and inside x, and x's boundary can't extend beyond z's boundary, x's boundary must touch z's boundary at p. This would make p a point on both x's boundary and z's boundary. But that contradicts the deduction that p is inside x but not on x's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me carefully reconsider this.

In RCC-8, if region A is inside region B, it doesn't mean every point of A is in the interior of B. It means every point of A is a point of B (which could be on B's boundary or in B's interior).

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means every point of y is inside x, and no point of y's boundary is on x's boundary. So every point of y's boundary is in the interior of x.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary. This means every point of y is inside z, and there's at least one point p that is both on y's boundary and on z's boundary.

From (1) and (2), we can deduce: p is on y's boundary, on z's boundary, and in the interior of x.

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z, touching z's boundary. This means every point of x is inside z, and there's at least one point q that is both on x's boundary and on z's boundary.

The question is: Can p and q be different points? If they can, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I'm missing something. If p is in the interior of x, it means there's a small neighborhood around p that's completely inside x. But if p is on z's boundary, and x is inside z, then any neighborhood around p must contain points outside z. But a neighborhood around p that's completely inside x can't contain points outside z. This is a contradiction.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me try drawing this out to see if I can clarify my understanding.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means every point of y is inside x, and no point of y's boundary is on x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary. This means every point of y is inside z, and there's at least one point p that is both on y's boundary and on z's boundary.

Imagine:
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary
- z is a region that contains both x and y

If y touches z's boundary at point p, then p is on both y's boundary and z's boundary. Since y is inside x without touching x's boundary, p is inside x. But if p is on z's boundary and inside x, then x can't be inside z (because if x were inside z, then every point of x would be inside z, and p, being on z's boundary, can't be inside z). This contradicts the requirement for TPP(x,z).

Hmm, I think I'm still getting tripped up on terminology. Inside a region means "in the interior of the region". On the boundary of a region means "on the boundary, not in the interior". 

Wait, I think I have a clear intuitive case where TPP(x,z) is not possible. If:
- y is inside x, not touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y))
- y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z))
- x is inside z (for TPP(x,z))

Since y touches z's boundary at point p, p is on both y's boundary and z's boundary. Since y is inside x without touching x's boundary, p is inside x but not on x's boundary. But if x is inside z, then every point of x is inside z. Since p is on z's boundary, it can't be inside z. This contradicts the deduction that p is inside x.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I think I finally have it straight:
When we say y is inside x not touching the boundary, we mean y is a subset of the interior of x. 
When we say y touches the boundary of z, we mean there is a point p which is in the intersection of the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a subset of the interior of x.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a subset of z, and there's a point p in the intersection of the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

From (1) and (2), we can deduce: p is on the boundary of y, on the boundary of z, and in the interior of x.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a subset of z, and there's a point q in the intersection of the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

Let's see if this leads to a contradiction. If x is a subset of z, and p is on the boundary of z and in the interior of x, then x's boundary must intersect z's boundary at p. This would make p a point on the boundary of x, which contradicts the deduction that p is in the interior of x.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Ok, I've reconsidered this multiple times, and I think TPP(x,z) is not possible. Let's now double-check the other possibilities.

For PO(x,z):
- x and z partially overlap, but neither is a subset of the other.
- x and z both contain y, so they overlap.
- There's no requirement that one must be a subset of the other.
So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
- z is a subset of x, and there's a point q in the intersection of the boundary of z and the boundary of x.
- We know y is a subset of the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y is a subset of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- Since y is a subset of both the interior of x and z, y is a subset of the intersection of the interior of x and z. This doesn't imply that z is a subset of x.
So I can't determine if TPPi(x,z) is possible based on this.

Actually, there's another way to approach this. If z were a subset of x, then z would be a proper subset of x (since y is a proper subset of z from TPP(y,z)). If z touches x's boundary, then there's a point q on both z's boundary and x's boundary. We know y touches z's boundary at a point p, and y is inside x without touching x's boundary, so p is not on x's boundary. So p and q are different points, which means p is on z's boundary but not on x's boundary. This is a valid configuration, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- z is a subset of the interior of x.
- We know y is a subset of z (from TPP(y,z)) and y is a subset of the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)).
- If z is a subset of the interior of x, then y is a subset of both z and the interior of x, which is consistent with the given conditions.
So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z):
- x and z are identical.
- We know y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)) and y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)).
- If x and z are identical, then y would either touch both of their boundaries or neither. But we know y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary. This is a contradiction.
So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check TPPi(x,z) again.

For TPPi(x,z):
- z is a subset of x, and there's a point q in the intersection of the boundary of z and the boundary of x.
- We know y is a subset of the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y is a subset of z, touching z's boundary at a point p (from TPP(y,z)).
- Since y is a subset of the interior of x, p is in the interior of x (not on x's boundary).
- If z is a subset of x, and z touches x's boundary at a point q, then q is on both z's boundary and x's boundary. We know p is not on x's boundary, so p and q are different points. This is a valid configuration.
So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what possible RCC-8 relations could hold between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me recall what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means that y is inside z and touches z's boundary

Now, let's analyze what this tells us about the relationship between x and z:

1. Since y is inside both x and z, x and z must overlap, which immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

2. For EQ(x,z): If x and z were identical, then y would either touch both their boundaries or neither. Since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

3. For TPP(x,z): If x were inside z touching z's boundary, we have a contradiction. Since y touches z's boundary at some point p, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then p must be inside x but not on x's boundary. But if x were inside z, this point p would have to be on x's boundary as well. This is a contradiction, so TPP(x,z) is impossible.

4. For NTPP(x,z): If x were completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) couldn't possibly touch z's boundary. This contradicts TPP(y,z), so NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. For PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible - they both contain y, but neither needs to be contained in the other.

6. For TPPi(x,z): z is inside x touching x's boundary. This is possible - y touches z's boundary at some point p (which is inside x, not on x's boundary), while z can touch x's boundary at a different point.

7. For NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This is possible - y would still be inside x without touching x's boundary, and could touch z's boundary as required.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
