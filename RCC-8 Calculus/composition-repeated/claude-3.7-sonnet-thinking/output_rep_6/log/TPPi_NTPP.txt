PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means that y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think through this systematically. Since y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is a proper part of z (from NTPP(y,z)), we have two regions, x and z, that both contain y. Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z and analyze which ones are consistent with our constraints.

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This would mean that x and z have no points in common. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but have no common interior. However, y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior points. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. For example, imagine that y is a proper part of both x and z, and there are parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This would mean that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. This is possible if x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This would mean that x is a proper part of z and x does not touch the boundary of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse: This would mean that z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. Let's check if this is consistent with our given constraints. We know that y is a proper part of x and y is a proper part of z. If z were a proper part of x, then y would be a proper part of z which is a proper part of x, which is consistent. The question is whether z can touch the boundary of x. Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)), and y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x) which is equivalent to TPPi(x,y)), z must extend beyond y in a way that it touches the boundary of x. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse: This would mean that z is a proper part of x and z does not touch the boundary of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x. Similar to the TPPi case, we have y as a proper part of z which is a proper part of x, which is consistent.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This would mean that x and z are the same region. Let's check if this is consistent. If x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of x, then y would be a proper part of z. Also, from TPPi(x,y), y touches the boundary of x, which would mean y touches the boundary of z. But from NTPP(y,z), y does not touch the boundary of z. This is a contradiction, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the TPPi(x,z) case more carefully. We have:
- TPPi(x,y) which means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) which means y is a proper part of z and y does not touch the boundary of z.

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. Since y is a proper part of z, y is also a proper part of x, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y). Also, since z touches the boundary of x, and y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, y doesn't touch the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which states that y touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me also reconsider the NTPPi(x,z) case. If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and z does not touch the boundary of x. Again, since y is a proper part of z, y is also a proper part of x, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y). But if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y definitely doesn't touch the boundary of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Actually, I realized I've been making a conceptual error. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x. It's not that "y touches the boundary of x" in the sense that y is on the outer edge of x; rather, it means that the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. 

Let me reconsider the problem with this understanding.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is a proper part of x, and the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is a proper part of z, and the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: If x and z are disconnected, they have no points in common. But y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: If x and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries but have no common interior. However, y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior points. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This would mean that x is a proper part of z and the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of z. Let's check if this is consistent. From TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x, and from NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. So if x is a proper part of z, we have y is a proper part of x which is a proper part of z, which is consistent. The question is whether the boundary of x can intersect with the boundary of z. From TPPi(x,y), the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. From NTPP(y,z), the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z. So, the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x but not with the boundary of z. This is possible if the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of z at points other than the boundary of y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This would mean that x is a proper part of z and the boundary of x does not intersect with the boundary of z. Again, y is a proper part of x which is a proper part of z, which is consistent. And if the boundary of x doesn't intersect with the boundary of z, then clearly the boundary of y doesn't intersect with the boundary of z (since y is contained in x), which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse: This would mean that z is a proper part of x and the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x. Let's check if this is consistent. From NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. From TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x. So if z is a proper part of x, we have y is a proper part of z which is a proper part of x, which is consistent. The question is whether the boundary of z can intersect with the boundary of x. From NTPP(y,z), the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z. From TPPi(x,y), the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. This means that the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x at some points, but these points are not on the boundary of z (since y doesn't touch the boundary of z). So the boundary of z can indeed intersect with the boundary of x at different points. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse: This would mean that z is a proper part of x and the boundary of z does not intersect with the boundary of x. As above, y is a proper part of z which is a proper part of x, which is consistent. But if the boundary of z doesn't intersect with the boundary of x, then z is completely in the interior of x. From NTPP(y,z), y is completely in the interior of z. So y would be completely in the interior of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y), which states that the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This would mean that x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then from TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x (which is z), and the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. But from NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z (which is x), and the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z. These are contradictory, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider the NTPPi(x,z) case again. If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and the boundary of z does not intersect with the boundary of x. From NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z and the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z. So y is in the interior of z, and z is in the interior of x. This means y is in the interior of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y), which states that y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Actually, let me try to be even more careful. In TPPi(x,y), we have that the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. In NTPP(y,z), the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z. 

Let's visualize this. Imagine three regions: x, y, and z. We know that y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is inside x, and at least one point on the boundary of y is also on the boundary of x. We also know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z, and no point on the boundary of y is on the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the different possible relationships between x and z:

1. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. This means that x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if, for example, x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas.

2. TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part. This means x is inside z, and at least one point on the boundary of x is also on the boundary of z. We know that at least one point on the boundary of y is also on the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)). And we know that no point on the boundary of y is on the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)). This means that the point(s) where the boundary of x touches the boundary of z must be different from the point(s) where the boundary of x touches the boundary of y. This is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part. This means x is inside z, and no point on the boundary of x is on the boundary of z. This is possible if x is completely in the interior of z.

4. TPPi(x,z): Tangential proper part inverse. This means z is inside x, and at least one point on the boundary of z is also on the boundary of x. We know that no point on the boundary of y is on the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)). This is possible if the point(s) where the boundary of z touches the boundary of x are different from all points on the boundary of y.

5. NTPPi(x,z): Non-tangential proper part inverse. This means z is inside x, and no point on the boundary of z is on the boundary of x. Given that y is inside z, and we know that at least one point on the boundary of y is also on the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), this leads to a contradiction. If a point is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then this point must be in the interior of z (not on its boundary, due to NTPP(y,z)). But if this point is in the interior of z, it can't be on the boundary of x if z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible for the reasons I already mentioned.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me really carefully consider the TPPi(x,z) case one more time, because I keep contradicting myself.

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x. From NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z and the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z. From TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x and the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of z which is a proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y).
- The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- The boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)).
- The boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,z)).

Is this configuration possible? Let's say there's a point p on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of x. From NTPP(y,z), we know that p is not on the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of z, p must be in the interior of z. But if p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, then the boundary of x intersects with the interior of z. This contradicts TPPi(x,z), which states that z is a proper part of x and the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x.

Actually, that's not right. If p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, that doesn't necessarily contradict TPPi(x,z). It just means that at this particular point p, the boundary of x doesn't intersect with the boundary of z. But there could be other points where the boundary of z does intersect with the boundary of x.

So let's be more precise. From TPPi(x,y), there's at least one point on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of x. Let's call this point p. From NTPP(y,z), p is not on the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of z, p must be in the interior of z. But if p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, then z cannot be a proper part of x. Because if z were a proper part of x, then all of z, including its interior, would be contained within x. But the boundary of x can't pass through the interior of z if z is contained within x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I realize that I was making it too complex. It's easier to visualize. If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x. If z is a proper part of x, then z is contained within x. If the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is contained within z (from NTPP(y,z)), then the boundary of z must also intersect with the boundary of x at those same points. But this contradicts NTPP(y,z), which states that the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I see the issue. I'm not being precise about the definition of "boundary". Let me re-examine the problem using the formal definitions.

In RCC-8, the boundary of a region is the set of points that are in the closure of the region but not in its interior. The interior of a region is the set of points in the region that have a neighborhood entirely contained in the region. The closure of a region is the union of the region and its boundary.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of x and y share at least one point.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of y and z don't share any points.

Now, let's reconsider the TPPi(x,z) case. If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of x and z share at least one point. Let's call this point q.

From TPPi(x,y), the boundaries of x and y share at least one point. Let's call this point p.

From NTPP(y,z), the boundaries of y and z don't share any points. So p, which is on the boundary of y, is not on the boundary of z.

So p is on the boundary of x and y, but not on the boundary of z. And q is on the boundary of x and z. The question is: can p and q be the same point? If they can, then TPPi(x,z) is not possible. If they can be different, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

If p and q are the same point, then p is on the boundary of x, y, and z. But this contradicts NTPP(y,z), which states that the boundaries of y and z don't share any points. So p and q must be different points.

So, the boundaries of x and y share the point p, and the boundaries of x and z share the point q, where p and q are different points. This configuration is consistent with TPPi(x,z).

Let's consider a concrete example: 
- x is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- y is the half-disk in the upper half-plane, with the diameter on the x-axis.
- z is the disk with radius 0.9 centered at the origin.

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (the boundaries share the diameter on the x-axis). And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (the boundary of y includes the diameter on the x-axis, which is not part of the boundary of z). Also, z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x, and the boundaries share all the points on the circle with radius 0.9 centered at the origin).

Hmm, that doesn't work. Let me try again. 

- x is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- y is the half-disk in the upper half-plane, with the diameter on the x-axis.
- z is the unit disk shifted slightly upward, so it contains all of y, but not all of x.

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (the boundaries share the diameter on the x-axis). But y is not a non-tangential proper part of z, because the boundaries of y and z share some points.

Let me try once more:
- x is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- y is a small disk in the upper half-plane, whose boundary touches the boundary of x at one point, say (0, 1).
- z is a disk centered slightly north of y, such that y is completely contained within z, but the boundary of z does not touch the boundary of x.

No, that doesn't work either, because z cannot be a tangential proper part of x.

I think the issue is that if y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then z cannot be a tangential proper part of x. This is because if y touches the boundary of x at some point p, and y is completely in the interior of z, then z must extend beyond y to include p. But if p is on the boundary of x, and z includes p, then z cannot be a proper part of x.

So, I believe TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Now let's try to be extra careful and consider the case of TPP(x,z). If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of x and z share at least one point.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of x and y share at least one point. Let's call this point p. From NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of y and z don't share any points. So p, which is on the boundary of y, is not on the boundary of z.

Now, if x is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x, then y is a proper part of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). The question is: can the boundaries of x and z share at least one point? If the boundaries of x and y share the point p, and p is not on the boundary of z, then the boundaries of x and z cannot share the point p. But they could share some other point. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Let's try a concrete example:
- z is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- x is the half-disk in the lower half-plane, with the diameter on the x-axis.
- y is a small disk in the lower half-plane, whose boundary touches the boundary of x at one point, say (0, -0.5).

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (the boundaries share the point (0, -0.5)). And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely in the interior of z). Also, x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z, and the boundaries share the diameter on the x-axis).

No, that doesn't quite work, because the boundary of y would also touch the boundary of z at (0, -0.5). Let me try again.

- z is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- x is a smaller disk centered at (0, -0.5), with radius 0.4.
- y is an even smaller disk centered at (0, -0.5), with radius 0.2.

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (the boundaries share the circle with radius 0.2 centered at (0, -0.5)). And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely in the interior of z). But x is not a tangential proper part of z because the boundary of x (the circle with radius 0.4 centered at (0, -0.5)) does not touch the boundary of z (the unit circle).

Actually, I realize I'm making a geometric error. In RCC-8, regions are regular closed sets. If y is a tangential proper part of x, it means that the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. But this doesn't mean that the boundary of y is a subset of the boundary of x. It just means that there's at least one point that's on both boundaries.

So let's try yet again:
- z is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- x is a disk centered at (0.5, 0), with radius 0.5.
- y is a disk centered at (0.7, 0), with radius 0.2.

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x, and the boundaries share the point (0.9, 0)). And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely in the interior of z, and the boundaries don't share any points). Also, x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z, and the boundaries share the point (1, 0)).

So it seems that TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) and PO(x,z) are also possible, for the reasons I previously mentioned.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me revisit the TPPi(x,z) case once more.

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of x and z share at least one point. From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of x and y share at least one point, let's call it p. From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of y and z don't share any points. So p, which is on the boundary of y, is not on the boundary of z.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of z which is a proper part of x.
- The point p is on the boundary of y and the boundary of x, but not on the boundary of z.

Since p is on the boundary of y, and y is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of y and z don't share any points, p must be in the interior of z. But if p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, can z still be a proper part of x? I think the answer is no. If z is a proper part of x, then all of z, including its interior, must be contained within x. But if p is in the interior of z, and p is on the boundary of x, then the interior of z is not contained within x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I think that's right.

Let me visualize once more. 
We have p on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x. But p is in the interior of z. Since p is on the boundary of x, it means that just outside p, there are points not in x. And since p is in the interior of z, it means that all points near p are in z. So, near p, there are points in z that are not in x. This means z is not a proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I think it's the same issue for NTPPi(x,z).

So I think the conclusion is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me carefully reconsider the case of TPPi(x,z).

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is inside x, and the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x, and the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x.

From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is inside z, and no part of the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z.

Now, let's think about the configuration. We know that y is inside z, and the boundary of y does not touch the boundary of z. We also know that y is inside x, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of x at some point p. Given that the boundary of y does not touch the boundary of z, this point p is not on the boundary of z. Since y is inside z, and p is on the boundary of y, p must be in the interior of z.

So we have:
- z is inside x.
- p is on the boundary of x.
- p is in the interior of z.

Is this configuration possible? If p is on the boundary of x, it means that there are points arbitrarily close to p that are outside x. And if p is in the interior of z, it means that all points sufficiently close to p are in z. But if z is inside x, all points in z should also be in x. So we have a contradiction. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So I conclude that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me use logic to make the case absolutely clear.
TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So:
3. y is a proper part of z.
4. The boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z.

From 2, we know there's a point p that's on both the boundary of y and the boundary of x.
From 4, we know p is not on the boundary of z.
From 3, since y is a proper part of z and p is on the boundary of y, p must be in the interior of z.

So p is on the boundary of x and in the interior of z.

If TPPi(x,z), it would mean:
5. z is a proper part of x.
6. The boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x.

From 5, if z is a proper part of x, then all of z is contained within x. But if p is in the interior of z, and p is on the boundary of x, then not all of z is contained within x (because the interior of z includes points outside x, near p). This contradicts 5.

Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would mean:
7. z is a proper part of x.
8. The boundary of z does not intersect with the boundary of x.

From 7, if z is a proper part of x, then all of z is contained within x. But again, if p is in the interior of z, and p is on the boundary of x, then not all of z is contained within x. This contradicts 7.

Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, I keep going back and forth on this.

I think I've misunderstood the definitions. Let me clarify the RCC-8 relations. In the Region Connection Calculus:

- TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b. So a is completely inside b, and a touches the boundary of b. This means that the closure of a is a subset of the closure of b, and the boundaries of a and b intersect.

- NTPP(a,b) means that a is a non-tangential proper part of b. So a is completely inside b, and a does not touch the boundary of b. This means that the closure of a is a subset of the interior of b.

- TPPi(a,b) means TPP(b,a).

- NTPPi(a,b) means NTPP(b,a).

So, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):

From TPPi(x,y), we have TPP(y,x). So y is completely inside x, and y touches the boundary of x. This means that the closure of y is a subset of the closure of x, and the boundaries of y and x intersect.

From NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z, and y does not touch the boundary of z. This means that the closure of y is a subset of the interior of z.

Now, let's consider the different possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know that y is in both x and z, so they must share at least y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. But we know that y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is completely inside z, and x touches the boundary of z. We know that y is inside both x and z. We know that y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x)), but y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)). This is possible if x touches the boundary of z at points where y doesn't touch the boundary of x.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So x is completely inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. We know that y is inside both x and z. We know that y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x)), but y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)). This is possible if all of x, including its boundary, is inside the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is completely inside x, and z touches the boundary of x. We know that y is inside both x and z. We know that y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x)), but y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)). This is possible if z touches the boundary of x at points where y doesn't touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is completely inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. We know that y is inside both x and z. We know that y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x)), but y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)). But if y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then z must also touch the boundary of x at those same points. But this contradicts the condition that z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. But we know that y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x)), but y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)). This is a contradiction, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider the NTPPi(x,z) case.

If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is completely inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. From TPP(y,x), y touches the boundary of x. And from NTPP(y,z), y is inside z. So y is inside z, which is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x. But if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is inside z, how can y touch the boundary of x? This is a contradiction, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Now let me check the TPPi(x,z) case again.

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is completely inside x, and z touches the boundary of x. From TPP(y,x), y touches the boundary of x. And from NTPP(y,z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So y is inside z, which is inside x, and both y and z touch the boundary of x. This is possible if z touches the boundary of x at points where y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, now I think I'm making a conceptual error with respect to "touches the boundary". Let me revisit the definition of tangential proper part. TPP(a,b) means that a is a proper part of b, and the boundaries of a and b share at least one point. "Touches the boundary" means that the boundaries intersect, not that one region extends to the boundary of the other. 

So here's the distinction: in a non-tangential proper part relation NTPP(a,b), the boundary of a is completely contained in the interior of b. In a tangential proper part relation TPP(a,b), at least one point on the boundary of a is also on the boundary of b.

Let's carefully trace through the implications again. We have:
- TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x share at least one point. Let's call this point p.
- NTPP(y,z), which means y is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of y and z don't share any points. This means the boundary of y is completely contained in the interior of z. So p, which is on the boundary of y, is in the interior of z.

Let's consider TPPi(x,z), which means TPP(z,x). This would mean that z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x share at least one point. We know that p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z. But if p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, can the boundary of z still intersect with the boundary of x? Yes, it can, at points other than p.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

However, NTPPi(x,z), which means NTPP(z,x), would mean that z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x don't share any points. But we know that p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z. If z's boundary can't touch x's boundary, then there's a gap between the boundary of z and the boundary of x. This means that near p, there are points in the interior of z that are outside x. But this contradicts z being a proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I think I've been overthinking the problem. Let me approach it fresh.

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have:
- y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x share at least one point.
- y is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of y and z don't share any points.

Now, let's consider the different possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. We know that y is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z. So if z is a proper part of x, then y is a proper part of z which is a proper part of x, which is consistent. But we also know that the boundaries of y and x share at least one point, let's call it p. And we know that the boundaries of y and z don't share any points. So p, which is on the boundary of y, is not on the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of z, p must be in the interior of z. But if p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, then the interior of z includes points on the boundary of x. This means the boundary of z cannot be completely contained in the interior of x. So z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

6. DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible for the reasons I already mentioned.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Let's double-check with a simple example. Imagine the following regions in 2D:
- x is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- y is a smaller disk centered at (0.5, 0), with radius 0.3.
- z is a disk centered at (0.5, 0), with radius 0.5.

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x, and the boundaries of y and x share the point (0.8, 0)). And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z, and the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of z). Also, z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x, and the boundaries of z and x share the point (1, 0)). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize I've been making a conceptual error in the previous examples. Let me carefully define the relationships again:

- DC(a,b): a and b are disconnected.
- EC(a,b): a and b are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points).
- PO(a,b): a and b partially overlap.
- TPP(a,b): a is a tangential proper part of b. So a is a proper part of b, and the boundaries of a and b share at least one point.
- NTPP(a,b): a is a non-tangential proper part of b. So a is a proper part of b, and the boundaries of a and b don't share any points.
- TPPi(a,b) means TPP(b,a).
- NTPPi(a,b) means NTPP(b,a).
- EQ(a,b): a and b are the same region.

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have:
- TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x share at least one point.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of y and z don't share any points.

Now, let's consider the different possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know that y is in both x and z, so they must share at least y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected. But we know that y is in both x and z, so they must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of x and z share at least one point. We know that y is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z. So if x is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of x which is a proper part of z, which is consistent. But we also know that the boundaries of y and x share at least one point, let's call it p. And we know that the boundaries of y and z don't share any points. So p, which is on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x, is not on the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of z, p must be in the interior of z. Now, if p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, can x still be a proper part of z? Yes, it can, as long as all of x is contained within z. This is possible, for example, if z is much larger than x, and z's boundary is far from x at all points except where x's boundary touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So x is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of x and z don't share any points. This is possible if all of x, including its boundary, is contained within the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x share at least one point. We know that y is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x. So if z is a proper part of x, then y is a proper part of z which is a proper part of x, which is consistent. But we also know that the boundaries of y and x share at least one point, let's call it p. And we know that the boundaries of y and z don't share any points. So p, which is on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x, is not on the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of z, p must be in the interior of z. Now, if p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, can z still be a proper part of x? Well, it can be a proper part, but it can't be a tangential proper part because for z to be tangential to x, z's boundary must touch x's boundary. But we've established that p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z. So there's a gap between the boundary of z and the boundary of x at the point p. This means z's boundary can't touch x's boundary at p. But z's boundary could touch x's boundary at other points. Actually, I realize I'm not considering the full implications of the constraints.

Let's approach TPPi(x,z) case differently.

We know that TPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z). Suppose TPP(z,x). Then the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x, but the boundary of y doesn't intersect with the boundary of z. Meanwhile, the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x. So, we have points p and q, where p is on the boundary of y and the boundary of x, and q is on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. But p is not on the boundary of z.

Is this configuration possible? Yes, it is. Take the following example in 2D:
- x is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- z is a smaller disk centered at (0.5, 0), with radius 0.4.
- y is an even smaller disk centered at (0.5, 0), with radius 0.2.

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (the boundaries share the point (0.7, 0), which I'll call p). And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of z). Also, z is a tangential proper part of x (the boundaries share the point (0.9, 0), which I'll call q). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For completeness, let's also check the NTPPi(x,z) case.

If NTPP(z,x), then z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x don't share any points. But we've shown above that it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x, which means z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x share at least one point. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

No wait, I think the example I provided for TPPi(x,z) has a flaw. Let's double-check.

If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is centered at (0.5, 0) with radius 0.2, and x is the unit disk centered at the origin, then the boundaries of y and x share the point (0.7, 0), which I called p. But if z is centered at (0.5, 0) with radius 0.4, then p is not on the boundary of z; instead, p is in the interior of z. The boundaries of z and x share the point (0.9, 0), which I called q. So far so good.

But here's the problem: If the boundary of y touches the boundary of x at p, and y is completely inside z, and p is in the interior of z, it suggests that the interior of z extends outside x, which contradicts z being a proper part of x. But that's not the case in the example I provided. Let's verify.

The boundary of y is the circle with center (0.5, 0) and radius 0.2. One point on this circle is (0.7, 0). The distance from (0.7, 0) to the origin is 0.7, which is less than 1. So the point (0.7, 0) is inside the unit disk x, not on its boundary.

I think I made a mistake in my calculation. Let's do it properly.

If y is a disk centered at (0.5, 0) with radius 0.2, and x is the unit disk centered at the origin, then the boundary of y is the circle with center (0.5, 0) and radius 0.2. One point on this circle is (0.7, 0). The distance from (0.7, 0) to the origin is 0.7, which is less than 1. So the point (0.7, 0) is inside the unit disk x, not on its boundary. So y is not a tangential proper part of x; it's a non-tangential proper part of x. That doesn't fit our constraint TPP(y,x).

Let me try again.

If x is the unit disk centered at the origin, and y is a disk centered at (0.8, 0) with radius 0.2, then the boundary of y is the circle with center (0.8, 0) and radius 0.2. One point on this circle is (1, 0). The distance from (1, 0) to the origin is 1, which is exactly the radius of x. So the point (1, 0) is on the boundary of x. So y is a tangential proper part of x.

If z is a disk centered at (0.8, 0) with radius 0.4, then the boundary of z is the circle with center (0.8, 0) and radius 0.4. One point on this circle is (1.2, 0). The distance from (1.2, 0) to the origin is 1.2, which is greater than 1. So the point (1.2, 0) is outside the unit disk x. This means z is not a proper part of x at all. So this example doesn't work for TPPi(x,z).

Let's try once more.

If x is the unit disk centered at the origin, and z is a disk centered at (0.6, 0) with radius 0.4, then the boundary of z is the circle with center (0.6, 0) and radius 0.4. One point on this circle is (1, 0). The distance from (1, 0) to the origin is 1, which is exactly the radius of x. So the point (1, 0) is on the boundary of x. So z is a tangential proper part of x.

If y is a disk centered at (0.7, 0) with radius 0.1, then the boundary of y is the circle with center (0.7, 0) and radius 0.1. One point on this circle is (0.8, 0). The distance from (0.8, 0) to the origin is 0.8, which is less than 1. So the point (0.8, 0) is inside the unit disk x, not on its boundary. Also, the distance from (0.8, 0) to (0.6, 0) is 0.2, which is less than 0.4. So the point (0.8, 0) is inside the disk z, not on its boundary. So y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z. That doesn't fit our constraint TPP(y,x).

I keep making errors, so let me try a new approach.

Let's define the regions so that I have a better handle on the boundaries:
- x is the square [0, 2] x [0, 2].
- z is the square [0.5, 1.5] x [0.5, 1.5].
- y is the square [0.5, 1] x [0.5, 1].

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x, and they share the point (0.5, 0.5), which is on the boundary of both). And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z, but they don't share any boundary points). Also, z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x, and they share the points (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (1.5, 1.5), which are on the boundary of both). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I made an error again. In the example I provided, y and z share the boundary point (0.5, 0.5), which contradicts NTPP(y,z). Let me try yet again.

- x is the unit disk centered at the origin.
- z is a disk centered at (0, 0) with radius 0.8.
- y is a disk centered at (0.4, 0) with radius 0.3.

Let's check the constraints:
- y is a proper part of x, and the boundary of y is the circle with center (0.4, 0) and radius 0.3. One point on this circle is (0.7, 0). The distance from (0.7, 0) to the origin is 0.7, which is less than 1. So the point (0.7, 0) is inside the unit disk x, not on its boundary. Another point on the boundary of y is (0.1, 0). The distance from (0.1, 0) to the origin is 0.1, which is less than 1. So the point (0.1, 0) is also inside the unit disk x, not on its boundary. So y is not a tangential proper part of x, contradicting TPP(y,x).

This is getting tricky. Let me step back and try to understand the constraint better. In TPP(y,x), we're saying that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of circles, let's use rectangles. Define:
- x is the rectangle [0, 3] x [0, 2].
- y is the rectangle [0, 1] x [0, 1].
- z is the rectangle [0, 2] x [0, 2].

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x, and they share the boundary points (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 0)). And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z, but doesn't touch the boundary of z, because the boundary of z is the rectangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0), and (2, 2), while y is the rectangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1)). Wait, actually, y shares the boundary point (0, 0) with z, and so y is actually a tangential proper part of z. So this also contradicts our constraint NTPP(y,z).

I'm finding it difficult to come up with a concrete example that satisfies all our constraints. Let me try once more with a slightly different approach.

Actually, let me take a different approach. Let's think abstractly about the constraints we have.

From TPP(y,x) we have:
- y is a proper part of x.
- The boundary of y and the boundary of x share at least one point.

From NTPP(y,z) we have:
- y is a proper part of z.
- The boundary of y and the boundary of z don't share any points.

For TPP(z,x) to be possible, we need:
- z is a proper part of x.
- The boundary of z and the boundary of x share at least one point.

We know that y is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x. So if z is a proper part of x, then y is a proper part of z which is a proper part of x, which is consistent.

We also know that the boundary of y and the boundary of x share at least one point, let's call it p. And we know that the boundary of y and the boundary of z don't share any points. So p, which is on the boundary of y, is not on the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of z, p must be in the interior of z.

The question is: can the boundary of z and the boundary of x share at least one point, let's call it q? If q is not the same as p, then it's possible for the boundary of z and the boundary of x to share the point q, even though p is in the interior of z. So TPP(z,x) is possible.

So TPPi(x,z) is possible. But it's tricky to construct a concrete example that satisfies all the constraints. 

So I think the conclusion is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me go back to what I established before. NTPP(z,x) would mean that z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x don't share any points. But if p is on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, then the interior of z includes points on the boundary of x. This means the boundary of z cannot be completely contained in the interior of x. So z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

So I'm sticking to my answer: The possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to understand what TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) tell us, then find which RCC-8 relations could hold between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so:
- y is a proper part of x
- The boundary of y touches the boundary of x at some point p

NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z
- The boundary of y does not touch the boundary of z

Now I'll analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of both x and z, they must overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is in the interior of both x and z, they share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with neither being a proper part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper part of z with their boundaries touching.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be entirely within the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a proper part of x with their boundaries touching (at points different from where y touches x).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were completely inside x with no boundary contact, then point p (where y touches the boundary of x) would be in the interior of z. But this is impossible - a point can't be simultaneously on x's boundary and in z's interior if z is completely inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x=z, then y would have the same relationship with both, contradicting our premises.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
