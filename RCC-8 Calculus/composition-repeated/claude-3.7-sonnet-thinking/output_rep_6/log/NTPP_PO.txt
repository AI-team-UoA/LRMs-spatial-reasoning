PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, meaning they share some parts but neither is a part of the other.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's go through the RCC-8 relations and check which ones are possible:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected?
   Since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), it's possible that x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So x and z could be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Can x and z touch only at their boundaries?
   Since x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z only partially overlap (PO(y,z)), it's possible that x just touches the boundary of z within y. But wait, NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch y's boundary, so x is strictly in the interior of y. If z overlaps with y, and x touches z's boundary, x would still be in the interior of y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

   Actually, let me reconsider this. NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If x touches z's boundary, it would have to be at a point within the interior of y. Since x is strictly inside y, it can touch the boundary of z that runs through the interior of y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partial overlap: Can x and z partially overlap?
   Since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), it's possible that x partially overlaps with the part of z that overlaps with y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), it's possible that x is completely inside the part of z that overlaps with y and touches the boundary of z within y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), it's possible that x is completely inside the part of z that overlaps with y and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x) - Tangential proper part inverse: Can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), this would imply that z is completely inside y as well. But PO(y,z) means z is not completely inside y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), this would imply that z is completely inside y as well. But PO(y,z) means z is not completely inside y. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Can x and z be equal?
   This means x and z are the same region. But since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), this would imply that z is completely inside y as well. But PO(y,z) means z is not completely inside y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check the reasoning for TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x):
If z is completely inside x, and x is completely inside y, then z must be completely inside y as well. But PO(y,z) means z is not completely inside y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x):
Similarly, if z is completely inside x, and x is completely inside y, then z must be completely inside y as well. But PO(y,z) means z is not completely inside y. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are the same region, and x is completely inside y, then z must be completely inside y as well. But PO(y,z) means z is not completely inside y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let me double-check the reasoning for EC(x,z).

For EC(x,z):
EC means that x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

If x is completely inside y and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x touches z's boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z. This would mean EC(x,z).

Let me reconsider this carefully. NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If x touches z's boundary, it would have to be at a point within the interior of y. Since x is strictly inside y, it can touch the boundary of z that runs through the interior of y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me try to visualize this more carefully. 

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. But if x is in the interior of y, and z partially overlaps with y, there are a few cases to consider:

1. If z is completely outside the region where x is located within y, then x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) would be true, not EC(x,z).
2. If z overlaps with the region where x is located within y, then x and z would share interior points, so either PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) would be true, not EC(x,z).
3. If z touches the boundary of x but doesn't share any interior points with x, and x is in the interior of y, then EC(x,z) would be true.

So, EC(x,z) is possible if z's boundary runs through the interior of y in such a way that it touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x's interior.

Now, let's double-check the reasoning for DC(x,z) as well.

For DC(x,z):
DC means that x and z are disconnected and don't share any parts.
NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

If x is completely inside y and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. In this case, x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) would be true.

So, DC(x,z) is possible.

Let's double-check the reasoning for PO(x,z).

For PO(x,z):
PO means that x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is completely contained in the other.
NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

If x is completely inside y and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x partially overlaps with the part of z that overlaps with y. In this case, x and z would share some interior points, but neither would be completely contained in the other, so PO(x,z) would be true.

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

Let's double-check the reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
TPP means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

If x is completely inside y and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of y where x is located is completely inside z, and x touches the boundary of z that runs through the interior of y. In this case, x would be completely inside z and would touch z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) would be true.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
NTPP means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

If x is completely inside y and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of y where x is located is completely inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. In this case, x would be completely inside z and wouldn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) would be true.

So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Let me summarize:

The possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

The relationships that are not possible are:
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

Actually, I think my reasoning about EC(x,z) needs to be more careful. Let me reconsider.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. 

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

If x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), then z's boundary could pass through the interior of y. Since x is also in the interior of y, it's possible for x to touch z's boundary without sharing any interior points with z. This would make EC(x,z) true.

But wait, I need to visualize this more carefully. 

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z):
- x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points.

If z's boundary passes through the interior of y, and x is also in the interior of y, then x and z could relate in several ways:
1. x could be completely disjoint from z, leading to DC(x,z).
2. x could partially overlap with z, leading to PO(x,z).
3. x could be completely inside z, touching z's boundary, leading to TPP(x,z).
4. x could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, leading to NTPP(x,z).
5. x could touch z's boundary without sharing any interior points with z, leading to EC(x,z).

The fifth scenario describes EC(x,z). Is it actually possible?

If z's boundary passes through the interior of y, and x is in the interior of y, for EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. This means x must be positioned in y in such a way that it just touches z's boundary that passes through y's interior.

I think this is possible. Imagine y as a big circle, x as a small circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z as another region that partially overlaps with y. The boundary of z can pass through the interior of y in such a way that it just touches the boundary of x without z and x sharing any interior points. In this case, EC(x,z) would be true.

So, EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

Now, let me re-summarize:

The possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

The relationships that are not possible are:
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

Actually, let me double-check the TPPi(x,z) case one more time, just to be sure.

For TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

If z is completely inside x, and x is completely inside y, then z must also be completely inside y. But PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with some parts of z outside of y. These two statements are contradictory.

So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given the same conditions, if z is completely inside x, and x is completely inside y, then z must also be completely inside y. But PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with some parts of z outside of y. These two statements are contradictory.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

And for EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be the same region.

Given the same conditions, if x and z are the same region, and x is completely inside y, then z must also be completely inside y. But PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with some parts of z outside of y. These two statements are contradictory.

So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think my reasoning is correct, and the final list of possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships can hold between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely inside y
- x doesn't touch y's boundary

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z partially overlap
- Neither is contained in the other

Let me analyze all possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Possible if x touches z's boundary that runs through the interior of y.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Possible if x overlaps with the part of z that intersects with y.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Not possible because if z were contained in x, and x is contained in y, then z would be contained in y, contradicting PO(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible because if x=z, then z would be completely inside y, contradicting PO(y,z).
