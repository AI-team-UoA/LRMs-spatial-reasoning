PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's first recall the meaning of these two relations:

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y and z does not touch the boundary of y.

So we have:
1. y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x
2. z is a proper part of y and z does not touch the boundary of y

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

Since z is a proper part of y (from NTPPi(y,z)) and y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), we can infer that z is a proper part of x. This means that either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x) holds.

To determine which one is correct, we need to check if z touches the boundary of x:

From TPPi(x,y), we know y touches the boundary of x.
From NTPPi(y,z), we know z is fully inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches the boundary of x, z must be strictly inside x and can't touch the boundary of x. So the relationship between z and x is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me re-check my reasoning:

1. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x. This means either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

Since z is strictly inside y (doesn't touch y's boundary) and y touches the boundary of x, can z touch the boundary of x? Let me think...

If z touches the boundary of x, it would mean that there's a point on the boundary of x that is also a point of z. But since z is strictly inside y, all points of z are interior points of y. So, for z to touch the boundary of x, there must be a point that is both an interior point of y and a boundary point of x. This can happen because y touches the boundary of x.

Actually, that doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider:

If z touches the boundary of x, there's a point on the boundary of x that belongs to z. Since z is strictly inside y (NTPP(z,y)), all points of z are interior points of y. So, for z to touch the boundary of x, there must be a point that is both an interior point of y and a boundary point of x.

Now, from TPP(y,x), we know y touches the boundary of x, which means there's a point that is both on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x. But this doesn't tell us if there's a point that is both an interior point of y and a boundary point of x.

Actually, I think I'm getting confused. Let me trace through this problem carefully:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y

So:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x
- z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y

From these, I can infer:
- z is inside x (since z is inside y and y is inside x)

The question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, I can't immediately determine whether z touches the boundary of x or not. It's possible that z is positioned in such a way that it touches the boundary of x from the inside without touching the boundary of y. It's also possible that z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Let me test both cases:

Case 1: If z touches the boundary of x
For this to be true, there must be a point p that is both on the boundary of x and a point of z. Since z is inside y, p must also be a point of y. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, p must be an interior point of y. So, we have p as both a boundary point of x and an interior point of y.

Is this possible given TPPi(x,y)?
From TPPi(x,y), y touches the boundary of x, which means there's a point q that is both on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x. But this doesn't contradict the possibility of having another point p that is both an interior point of y and a boundary point of x.

So, it seems possible that z touches the boundary of x, which means TPP(z,x) is a possible relationship.

Case 2: If z doesn't touch the boundary of x
For this to be true, all points of z are interior points of x. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x, this is definitely possible.

So, NTPP(z,x) is also a possible relationship.

Actually, let me try a different approach. I'll try to draw a simple diagram to understand the constraints.

For TPPi(x,y):
x is a larger region and y is a smaller region inside x. The boundary of y touches the boundary of x at some point.

For NTPPi(y,z):
y is a larger region and z is a smaller region inside y. The boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y at any point.

Given these, z is a region inside y, which in turn is inside x. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, it's not immediately clear if z can touch the boundary of x.

Actually, if z touches the boundary of x, it would also have to touch the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). This is because the only way for z to touch the boundary of x is if it extends to the boundary of y at precisely the point where y touches the boundary of x. But since NTPPi(y,z) tells us z doesn't touch the boundary of y, z can't touch the boundary of x.

Wait, that's not necessarily true. Let me think again...

Let's imagine y as a circle inside a larger circle x, with y touching the boundary of x at a single point. Now, z is a circle inside y, not touching the boundary of y. It's possible to position z in such a way that it touches the boundary of x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x, without z touching the boundary of y elsewhere.

Hmm, actually, that's not right. If z touches the boundary of x, it must touch the boundary of y at the same point, which would contradict NTPPi(y,z).

I think I've been making an error. Let's be more precise:

For TPPi(x,y) or TPP(y,x): There's a boundary point of y that is also a boundary point of x.
For NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y): There's no boundary point of z that is also a boundary point of y.

If z touches the boundary of x, there's a boundary point of z that is also a boundary point of x. Given the constraints, for this to happen, there must be a point that is both a boundary point of z and a boundary point of x, but not a boundary point of y. Is this possible?

Let's consider the case where y touches the boundary of x at a single point p. For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to have a point q on its boundary that is also on the boundary of x. Given that z is inside y, q must also be a point of y. If q is the same as p, then z would be touching the boundary of y at p, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). If q is not the same as p, then q would be a boundary point of x that is an interior point of y. But this contradicts the definition of TPPi(x,y), which says y is tangential to x, meaning y intersects with the boundary of x, but doesn't have any interior point on the boundary of x.

So, for z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to touch the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

Hmm, I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct. Maybe I should take a step back to double-check.

Let me really review the definitions of these relations to make sure I'm understanding them correctly:

- TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of x at at least one point.
- TPPi(x,y): x is a tangential proper inverse part of y. This means y is a tangential proper part of x. So, y is completely inside x, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of x at at least one point. (This is also TPP(y,x), but I'm restating it for clarity).
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y, and the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y at any point.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper inverse part of z. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, z is completely inside y, and the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y at any point. (This is also NTPP(z,y), but I'm restating it for clarity).

Given TPPi(x,y), we know y is a tangential proper part of x. So, y is completely inside x, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of x at at least one point.

Given NTPPi(y,z), we know z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, z is completely inside y, and the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y at any point.

From these, we know:
- z is completely inside y
- y is completely inside x
- The boundary of y touches the boundary of x at at least one point
- The boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y at any point

So, z is completely inside x. The question is: Does the boundary of z touch the boundary of x at any point?

Given that the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is tangential to x, it's unlikely that z would touch the boundary of x. For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Such a point would be in y (because z is in y). But since the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y, this point would have to be an interior point of y. However, interior points of y are interior points of x, not boundary points of x. So, it's not possible for z to touch the boundary of x.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful. Interior points of y are not necessarily interior points of x. If y touches the boundary of x, there can be points in y that are on the boundary of x.

Let's look at the constraints one by one:
- TPPi(x,y) means the boundary of y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

For the boundary of z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is inside y, p is a point in y. If p is on the boundary of y, then the boundary of z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). If p is an interior point of y, then p can't be on the boundary of x because y is tangential to x, which means the boundary of y touches the boundary of x, not the interior of y.

Actually, let's clarify again:
- TPP(y,x) means y is a proper part of x, and there's a point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of x.
- NTPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y, and there's no point on the boundary of z that is also on the boundary of y.

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point on the boundary of z that is also on the boundary of x. Let's call this point p. Since z is a part of y, p is also a point in y. But if p is on the boundary of z, and there's no point on the boundary of z that is also on the boundary of y (from NTPP(z,y)), then p must be an interior point of y. Now, if p is an interior point of y and also on the boundary of x, is this possible given TPP(y,x)?

From TPP(y,x), we know y is a proper part of x, and there's a point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of x. Let's call this point q. Now, p and q are both on the boundary of x. p is an interior point of y, and q is a boundary point of y. This seems possible to me.

So, it seems plausible that z can touch the boundary of x, even though it doesn't touch the boundary of y. This would mean TPP(z,x) is a possible relationship.

But can z be completely inside x without touching its boundary? Absolutely. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x, z can be positioned deep inside y, away from the boundaries of both y and x. This would mean NTPP(z,x) is also a possible relationship.

To be sure, let me try another approach to determine the possible relationships between z and x.

OK I think that was becoming too complex without a clear answer. Let me refer to the composition table for RCC-8, which gives the possible relations resulting from combining two given relations. I need to look at the composition of TPPi and NTPPi.

Actually I'll try another approach. Let's try to enumerate the possible positions to check:

1. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. Topologically, we can think of x as a larger region, and y as a smaller region inside x touching the boundary of x.
2. NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Topologically, we can think of y as a larger region, and z as a smaller region fully inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

Combining these two, we have z inside y, and y inside x with y touching the boundary of x. The relationship between z and x depends on whether z touches the boundary of x.

Since z is fully inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, can z touch the boundary of x?

For z to touch the boundary of x, there needs to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is inside y, p is a point in y. If p is on the boundary of y, then z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). If p is an interior point of y, can it be on the boundary of x?

Given TPPi(x,y), y touches the boundary of x, which means there are points that are both on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x. But this doesn't imply that there are interior points of y that are on the boundary of x. In fact, since y is a proper part of x, all interior points of y are interior points of x.

So, z cannot touch the boundary of x. This means the relationship between z and x is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, actually I'm not sure this reasoning is right either. Let me try a concrete example and see if it helps:

Let's say x is a square, y is a circle inside x touching one side of the square, and z is a smaller circle inside y but not touching the boundary of y. In this case, TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) hold.

Now, the question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of x, there's a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is inside y, p is a point in y. If p is on the boundary of y, then z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). If p is an interior point of y, can it be on the boundary of x?

For an interior point of y to be on the boundary of x, y would have to "penetrate" the boundary of x, which is not allowed in the TPP relationship. In TPP(y,x), y is tangential to x, which means y touches the boundary of x from the inside, but doesn't have any interior point on the boundary of x.

So, it seems like z cannot touch the boundary of x, and the relationship is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I'm still not sure. Let me re-check the definition of TPP to be sure:

TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x. The "touching" means that the boundary of y and the boundary of x have non-empty intersection, not that there are interior points of y on the boundary of x.

So, for y to be a tangential proper part of x, there needs to be at least one point that is both on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x. The key here is that this point is on the boundary of y, not in the interior of y.

Given this, for z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, p would have to be an interior point of y. For p to also be on the boundary of x, y would have to have an interior point on the boundary of x, which isn't allowed in the TPP relationship.

OK it's clear: z cannot touch the boundary of x. So, the relationship between z and x is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this one more time, because I think my reasoning might be off. The RCC-8 calculus is based on regions, and the relationship between these regions. I think I might not have a completely correct understanding.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. y is a proper part of x (all points of y are points of x, and there are points of x that are not points of y).
2. y touches the boundary of x, which means the boundaries of y and x share at least one point.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. z is a proper part of y (all points of z are points of y, and there are points of y that are not points of z).
2. z doesn't touch the boundary of y, which means the boundaries of z and y don't share any point.

Given these two, we can say:
1. z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. So, z is a proper part of x.
2. The boundaries of y and x share at least one point. Let's call this point p.
3. The boundaries of z and y don't share any point. In particular, z doesn't contain the point p.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x? For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point q that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is inside y, q is a point of y. If q is on the boundary of y, then z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). If q is an interior point of y, can it be on the boundary of x?

Actually, yes, it's possible. Consider the following scenario:
- x is a rectangle.
- y is an L-shaped region inside x, with one end of the L touching the boundary of x. Let's call this touching point p.
- z is a circle inside the L, not touching the L's boundary. However, z is positioned in such a way that it touches the boundary of x at a point q which is different from p.

In this case, TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) hold. And z touches the boundary of x, making TPP(z,x) a valid relationship.

I think I may be making a mistake in my geometric visualization.  Let me just check the RCC-8 composition table, which should give the definitive answer. 

Based on the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of TPPi and NTPPi can result in either TPPi, NTPPi, or PO.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again, and use a simpler approach.

If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

This means z is inside x, since z is inside y and y is inside x.

For the relationship between z and x, we need to determine if z touches the boundary of x.

I said that the composition of TPPi and NTPPi could result in TPPi, NTPPi, or PO, but I'm pretty sure I remembered incorrectly.

OK, let's work it out step by step again. We'll systematically analyze the possible relationships between z and x given the constraints.

From TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we know:
- y is a tangential proper part of x.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

This means:
1. y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. z is inside x (transitivity of "inside").

Now, for the relationship between z and x, I need to check all possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(z,x): This means z and x are disconnected. But we know z is inside x, so this is false.
2. EC(z,x): This means z touches the boundary of x but doesn't overlap. But we know z is inside x, so this is false.
3. PO(z,x): This means z partially overlaps with x. But we know z is completely inside x, so this is false.
4. TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
5. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
6. TPPi(z,x): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. But we know z is inside x, so this is false.
7. NTPPi(z,x): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But we know z is inside x, so this is false.
8. EQ(z,x): This means z and x are the same. But we know z is inside y and y is inside x, so this is false.

Now we're left with TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x). I need to check if z touches the boundary of x.

I've been vacillating on this, but I think it's because I had a misconception. When we say TPP(y,x), it doesn't mean all boundary points of y touch the boundary of x. It just means at least one boundary point of y touches the boundary of x.

Given this, let's proceed:
- TPPi(x,y) means the boundary of y touches the boundary of x at at least one point. Let's call this point p.
- NTPPi(y,z) means the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point q that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is inside y, q is a point of y. Now, there are two cases:
1. q is on the boundary of y. In this case, z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). So, this is not possible.
2. q is an interior point of y. In this case, q is both an interior point of y and on the boundary of x. Is this possible?

Actually, it's NOT possible. All interior points of y are interior points of x because y is a proper part of x. So, it's not possible for an interior point of y to be on the boundary of x.

So, z cannot touch the boundary of x. The relationship between z and x is therefore NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, there seems to be a mistake in my reasoning. The fact that y is a tangential proper part of x doesn't mean that all interior points of y are interior points of x. It just means that y is a proper part of x, and there's at least one point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of x.

For a point to be an interior point of a region, it means the point is inside the region and not on its boundary. Given that y is a proper part of x, all points of y (including its interior points) are points of x. But this doesn't mean all interior points of y are interior points of x. Some interior points of y might be on the boundary of x.

Let me reconsider the possibility of an interior point of y being on the boundary of x.

From TPPi(x,y), we know y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x, and there's at least one point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of x. But this doesn't imply anything about interior points of y being on the boundary of x.

Actually, I think there's a clearer way to approach this:

Given TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x. The tangentiality means that y touches the boundary of x, which in turn means that the boundaries of y and x share at least one point. However, this doesn't imply that all of y's boundary points touch x's boundary. Some of y's boundary points might be interior points of x.

Similarly, the fact that y is a proper part of x means all points of y are points of x, but not all points of x are points of y. Some points of x are outside of y.

Now, given NTPPi(y,z), we know z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y, and the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y. All boundary points of z are interior points of y.

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is inside y, p is a point of y. Specifically, p is an interior point of y (because the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y). 

So, the question becomes: Can an interior point of y be on the boundary of x?

Yes, it's possible, but only if y "dips" into the boundary of x. This can happen if y is shaped in such a way that it extends to the boundary of x, but also has parts that are away from the boundary. For example, imagine y as a crescent-shaped region inside x, with the outer edge of the crescent touching the boundary of x at one point, and z as a small circle inside the crescent, touching the boundary of x but not the boundary of y.

So, both TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are possible relationships between z and x.

Actually, wait a moment. I think I'm still missing a key detail. TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. It means y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x share at least one point. The key part I'm missing is that the boundaries share points, but the interior of y doesn't have to be fully inside the interior of x.

In other words, even though y is a proper part of x, the boundary of y can intersect with the boundary of x. This is the "tangential" part of TPP.

Let me reanalyze:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x share at least one point. The interior of y is a subset of the closure of the interior of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y, and the boundaries of z and y don't share any point. The closure of z is a subset of the interior of y. Actually, let me check those last couple sentences. In the RCC-8 theory, NTPP(z,y) means z is a proper subset of the interior of y.

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. From NTPPi(y,z), we know the boundary of z is a subset of the interior of y. So, p is an interior point of y. For p to also be on the boundary of x, it would mean the interior of y intersects with the boundary of x.

Now, does the interior of y intersect with the boundary of x? From TPPi(x,y), we know the boundaries of y and x share at least one point. But it doesn't imply anything about the interior of y intersecting with the boundary of x. Let me work out if that's possible...

Actually, I think my formulation in terms of point sets isn't quite working out. Let's think about these concepts more generally.

In RCC-8, TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. "Touches" means the boundary of y meets the boundary of x at at least one point.

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. The boundary of z is completely inside the interior of y.

Now, for z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. But since the boundary of z is inside the interior of y, this would require the interior of y to intersect with the boundary of x. 

Is it possible for the interior of y to intersect with the boundary of x, given that y is a tangential proper part of x? I believe it's not, and here's why: TPP(y,x) means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, where "touches" means the boundary of y meets the boundary of x. The interior of y is completely inside the interior of x. So, the interior of y can't intersect with the boundary of x.

Given this, z can't touch the boundary of x, and the relationship between z and x is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think my understanding was incorrect. In RCC-8, "tangential proper part" doesn't necessarily mean that the boundary of the part intersects with the boundary of the whole. It means that the closure of the part intersects with the boundary of the whole.

Actually, I think we need to be more precise. In RCC-8:

- TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x, and the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. In other words, there's at least one point that is both on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x.
- NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y, and the boundary of z doesn't intersect with the boundary of y. In other words, there's no point that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of y. This implies that the boundary of z is entirely within the interior of y.

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since the boundary of z is within the interior of y, p is an interior point of y. For p to also be on the boundary of x, it would mean the interior of y intersects with the boundary of x.

Is it possible for the interior of y to intersect with the boundary of x, given that y is a tangential proper part of x? I believe it is, and here's why: TPP(y,x) only specifies that the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x. It doesn't say anything about the interior of y not intersecting with the boundary of x. For example, imagine y is a figure-8 shaped region inside x, with one end of the 8 touching the boundary of x. The figure-8 shape can be such that parts of its interior are right next to the boundary of x, almost touching it.

So, it's possible for the interior of y to intersect with the boundary of x. By extension, it's possible for the boundary of z to intersect with the boundary of x, making TPP(z,x) a possible relationship between z and x.

But it's also possible for z to be completely inside the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x. In this case, the relationship would be NTPP(z,x).

So, the possible relationships between z and x are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

OK, I'm going back and forth, but I'm getting confused with my own reasoning. Let me take a deep breath and take a systematic approach.

From TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we know:
- y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y (from NTPPi(y,z)).

These statements translate to:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

This means:
- z is inside x (because z is inside y and y is inside x).

Now, let's look at the RCC-8 relations that involve one region being inside another:
- TPP(z,x): z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

For the relationship between z and x, I need to check if z touches the boundary of x. Let's analyze this:
- Since z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, the boundary of z is entirely within the interior of y.
- For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since the boundary of z is within the interior of y, p is an interior point of y. For p to also be on the boundary of x, it would mean the interior of y intersects with the boundary of x.

Here's where I previously got confused: Is it possible for the interior of y to intersect with the boundary of x, given that y is a tangential proper part of x?

In RCC-8, the statement that y is a tangential proper part of x means:
1. y is a proper part of x (which means all points of y are points of x, and there are points of x that are not points of y).
2. The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of x (which means there's at least one point that is both on the boundary of y and on the boundary of x).

It doesn't say anything about the interior of y not intersecting with the boundary of x. So let's suppose the interior of y does intersect with the boundary of x. Consider a specific point p that's in the interior of y and also on the boundary of x. Since y is a proper part of x, all points of y (including p) are points of x. But if p is on the boundary of x, it's not in the interior of x. So, p is a point of y that's not in the interior of x, which seems contradictory.

Hmm, I think I'm struggling with the formal definitions.

In my interpretation, if y is a proper part of x, it means y is a subset of x, and there are points of x that are not points of y. But being a subset doesn't imply that the interior of y is a subset of the interior of x. It's possible for points of y to be on the boundary of x. But, if a point of y is on the boundary of x, it's not in the interior of x.

But then, can a region (like y) contain points on the boundary of another region (like x) while still being considered "inside" that region? I'm not sure.

Let me re-examine this issue using the RCC-8 definitions.

Actually, I haven't found a clear definition, but I think I have a better understanding:

In RCC-8, regions are sets of points. The relationship TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x intersect. The proper part relation means y is a subset of x, and y is not equal to x. The boundary of a region is the set of points that are on the edge of the region. The interior of a region is the set of points that are inside the region, but not on its boundary.

If y is a proper part of x, all points of y are points of x. This includes both the interior and boundary points of y. So, all interior points of y are points of x, but they might not all be interior points of x. Some interior points of y could be on the boundary of x.

With this understanding, let's revisit our original problem:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x intersect.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y, and the boundaries of z and y don't intersect.

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would have to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. From NTPP(z,y), we know the boundary of z doesn't intersect with the boundary of y. This means all boundary points of z are interior points of y or, equivalently, the boundary of z is a subset of the interior of y.

Now, can an interior point of y be on the boundary of x?

From TPP(y,x), we know y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x intersect. Being a proper part means all points of y are points of x. But it doesn't specify which points of y can be interior or boundary points of x. I believe it's plausible for the interior of y to contain a point that is on the boundary of x. 

So let's suppose p is an interior point of y, a boundary point of z, and also a boundary point of x. This is possible as discussed earlier. Since p is on the boundary of z, the boundary of z touches the boundary of x, which means TPP(z,x). So TPP(z,x) is one possible relationship between z and x.

Another possibility is that the boundary of z is fully inside the interior of x, which means NTPP(z,x). This happens when the interior of y doesn't intersect with the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between z and x are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

Let me try to construct a concrete example to see if TPP(z,x) is indeed a possibility, where z touches the boundary of x without touching the boundary of y.

Let's start with a simple geometry:
- x is a square.
- y is a rectangular U-shape inside x, with the open end of the U touching the boundary of x.
- z is a circle inside the U, touching the boundary of x but not the boundary of the U.

In this example, y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Yet, z touches the boundary of x, which means TPP(z,x).

So, TPP(z,x) is one possible relationship between z and x, and NTPP(z,x) is the other.

Alternatively, to verify using the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of TPPi and NTPPi would give the possible relationships between z and x. Based on the rules of RCC-8, the composition of TPPi and NTPPi results in multiple possible relations, which might include TPP, NTPP, PO, etc. But, using our logical reasoning, we've narrowed it down to TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x). I'm fairly confidence in this answer, so I'll go with this.

Actually, now I'm second-guessing myself again. Let's make sure with the composition tables.

Looking at the RCC-8 composition table (specifically, the composition of TPPi and NTPPi), the result is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Given my logical reasoning, I've ruled out DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ, leaving only TPP and NTPP as possible relationships between z and x.

I'm confused that the composition tables allow all relations. Let me step back to the precise definitions, and trace through the example I provided earlier:
- x is a square.
- y is a rectangular U-shape inside x, with the open end of the U touching the boundary of x. That is, y touches the boundary of x, but doesn't cross it. So TPPi(x,y) holds, i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x.
- z is a circle inside the U. The key is that z should be fully inside the U, not touching the boundary of the U, to satisfy NTPPi(y,z). Also, we want z to touch the boundary of x, making TPP(z,x) a valid relationship.

Wait, I think I see the issue. If z is fully inside the U and doesn't touch the boundary of the U, can it touch the boundary of x? Only if the interior of the U touches the boundary of x, which seems odd for a U-shape.

Let me go back to my reasoning. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. "Touches" here means the boundary of y meets the boundary of x, not that the interior of y meets the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. The boundary of z is completely inside the interior of y.

Given these, z is inside x, because it's inside y and y is inside x. But, can z touch the boundary of x? For this to happen, there would have to be a point p that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. From NTPPi(y,z), we know the boundary of z is inside the interior of y. So, p is an interior point of y. For p to also be on the boundary of x, the interior of y would have to meet the boundary of x. But, from TPPi(x,y), we know the boundary of y meets the boundary of x, not that the interior of y meets the boundary of x.

Actually, the statement that "the boundary of y meets the boundary of x" doesn't preclude the possibility that the interior of y also meets the boundary of x. In fact, I can visualize many shapes where the interior of a region touches the boundary of another region. For example, if y is a U-shape as I described, the interior of the U can touch the boundary of x.

So, it's possible for the interior of y to meet the boundary of x, which means z can touch the boundary of x, making TPP(z,x) a possibility.

But it's also possible for z to be completely inside the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x, making NTPP(z,x) a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between z and x are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

OK, I'm confident in my answer now.

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. TPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x.
2. NTPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given the two constraints.

First, let's understand what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

From these facts, I can deduce:
1. z is inside y (from NTPPi(y,z))
2. y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y))
3. Therefore, z is inside x (by transitivity)

Now, for the relationship between x and z, I need to determine whether z can touch the boundary of x:

For z to touch the boundary of x, there would need to be a point that is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x. Since z is fully inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, all boundary points of z are interior points of y. 

Two possibilities exist:
1. If z is positioned such that it touches the boundary of x at a point where the interior of y meets the boundary of x, then TPP(z,x) holds, which means TPPi(x,z).
2. If z is positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of x at all, then NTPP(z,x) holds, which means NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are geometrically possible.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
