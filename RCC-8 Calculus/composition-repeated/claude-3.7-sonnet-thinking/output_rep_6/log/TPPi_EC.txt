PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this carefully.

First, let's understand what we know:
1. TPPi(x,y) - This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z) - This means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think about what these two relationships tell us about the spatial arrangement.

Since y is inside x and touches x's boundary (TPPi(x,y)), and y touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), we need to consider the possible positions of z relative to x.

Let's consider the possible arrangements:

1. z could be completely outside x, touching x only at the boundary where y also touches x. This would make x and z externally connected, so EC(x,z).

2. z could partially overlap with x. This would mean that z extends both inside and outside of x, which is possible if z touches y at the boundary. This would make x and z partially overlapping, so PO(x,z).

3. z could be completely disconnected from x. But this seems impossible because z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x. So z must at least touch x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

4. z could be a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This seems possible if z touches y at the boundary and is entirely inside x. So TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary. But since z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x, z must also touch the boundary of x at least at the point where y does. So NTPP(z,x) is not possible.

6. x could be a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This seems possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary at the point where y does. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

7. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary. But since y is inside x and y touches z, x must also touch z at least at the point where y does. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. x and z could be equal, which seems unlikely given the constraints. If x and z were equal, then y would be a tangential proper part of both, and y would touch the boundary of z. But if y touches the boundary of z and y is inside z, then y can't be externally connected to z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, it seems like the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and TPP(x,z).

But let me double-check by drawing some quick mental pictures:

1. EC(x,z): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle outside x, touching x exactly where y touches x. This is externally connected.

2. PO(x,z): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle that partially overlaps with x, with the overlap including the point where y touches x's boundary. This is partially overlapping.

3. TPP(z,x): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle inside x, touching x's boundary at the same point where y touches it, and also touching y. This makes z a tangential proper part of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary. Now imagine x as another circle inside z, also containing y, and touching z's boundary at the same point where y touches it. This makes x a tangential proper part of z.

But wait, there's a problem with TPP(x,z). If x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y is inside z. But then y and z cannot be externally connected. So TPP(x,z) is actually not possible.

I also need to reconsider NTPP(z,x). If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z and y can still touch each other inside x. So NTPP(z,x) seems possible after all.

Let me reconsider all the possibilities:

1. EC(x,z): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle outside x, touching x exactly where y touches x. This is externally connected. Possible.

2. PO(x,z): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle that partially overlaps with x, with the overlap including the point where y touches x's boundary. This is partially overlapping. Possible.

3. TPP(z,x): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle inside x, touching x's boundary at the same point where y touches it, and also touching y. This makes z a tangential proper part of x. Possible.

4. NTPP(z,x): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle inside x, not touching x's boundary, but touching y. This makes z a non-tangential proper part of x. 

But wait, there's a problem with NTPP(z,x) as well. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z doesn't touch x's boundary. But if y touches x's boundary and z touches y, then z must touch the boundary of x as well. So NTPP(z,x) is actually not possible.

Hmm, let me reconsider the constraints more carefully. It seems I've been making an assumption that if y touches the boundary of x and z touches y, then z must touch the boundary of x as well. But this isn't necessarily true. z could touch y at a point that's not on the boundary of x. 

Let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches x only at the boundary where y also touches x. Possible.

2. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x, and touches y at the boundary. Possible.

3. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y. Possible.

4. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary. 

Actually, I was mistaken earlier. If y touches the boundary of x and z touches y, it doesn't necessarily mean that z touches the boundary of x. z could touch y at a point that's inside x, not on the boundary. So NTPP(z,x) is indeed possible.

5. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y is inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y is inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z were equal, then y would be a tangential proper part of both, and y would touch the boundary of z. But if y touches the boundary of z and y is inside z, then y can't be externally connected to z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

8. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This would mean x and z share no points. But if y touches the boundary of x and y touches z, then x and z must share at least one point (where y touches both). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I want to be even more careful with these determinations. Let me think about each case more carefully:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, so they don't share any parts. If y is a tangential proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, then y and z share a boundary point. Since y is inside x, that boundary point is also part of x. This means x and z share a point, which contradicts them being disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, so they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible if z touches x only at the boundary where y also touches the boundary of x. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, so they share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x, and touches y at the boundary. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, so x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y is inside z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y. So TPP(z,x) is possible.

6. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y is inside z. But this contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. 

Actually, I need to be more careful here. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, but z is externally connected to y (which touches the boundary of x), there might be a contradiction. 

Let's think about it: If y touches the boundary of x at point p, and z touches y at point q, then q must be a point of y. If y is inside x, then q is inside x (unless q is on the boundary of x where y touches it). If q is inside x, then z must have at least one point inside x. 

But if z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z can't be externally connected to y, because y would have to be inside x as well, and two regions that are both inside another region can't be just externally connected, they either overlap or one is inside the other.

So, NTPP(z,x) is actually not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z were equal, then y would be a tangential proper part of both, and y would touch the boundary of z. But if y touches the boundary of z and y is inside z, then y can't be externally connected to z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(z,x).

Actually, I realize that I've been making a mistake in my reasoning about NTPP(z,x). Let's think about it again.

NTPP(z,x) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Now, we also know that EC(y,z), which means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

And we know TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, it's still possible for z to touch y at its boundary. Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside x touching the boundary of x, and z as an even smaller circle inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but touching y. This scenario is possible.

So, NTPP(z,x) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Let me review these answers by double-checking with a different approach.

1. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. If y is a tangential proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, then y and z share a boundary point. It's possible for this boundary point to be on the boundary of x as well, making x and z externally connected. So EC(x,z) is possible.

2. PO(x,z): x and z share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other. If y is a tangential proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, then y and z share a boundary point. It's possible for z to extend both inside and outside of x, making x and z partially overlapping. So PO(x,z) is possible.

3. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y is a tangential proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, then y and z share a boundary point. It's possible for this boundary point to be on the boundary of x as well, making z a tangential proper part of x. So TPP(z,x) is possible.

4. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If y is a tangential proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, then y and z share a boundary point. It's possible for this boundary point to be inside x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPP(z,x) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(z,x) once more. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, then y and z can touch at their boundaries, but only if the point where they touch is inside x. This seems plausible.

But, on second thought, if y touches the boundary of x, and z touches y, we need to consider where exactly z touches y. If z touches y at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPP(z,x). But if z touches y at a point inside x, not on the boundary, then z can be a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPP(z,x) is possible, but only if z touches y at a point inside x.

Hmm, but I want to be absolutely sure about this. The definition of TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. 

And EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

So y touches z at a boundary point. This boundary point must be part of y. If this boundary point is also on the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x, which means z can't be a non-tangential proper part of x.

But if this boundary point is inside x, not on the boundary, then z can be a non-tangential proper part of x.

So NTPP(z,x) is possible, but only if z touches y at a point inside x, not on the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Let me check with a quick mental picture to make sure I'm correct:

1. EC(x,z): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle outside x, touching x exactly where y touches x. This is externally connected. Possible.

2. PO(x,z): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle that partially overlaps with x, with the overlap including the point where y touches x's boundary. This is partially overlapping. Possible.

3. TPP(z,x): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle inside x, touching x's boundary at the same point where y touches it, and also touching y. This makes z a tangential proper part of x. Possible.

4. NTPP(z,x): Imagine x as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. Now imagine z as another circle inside x, not touching x's boundary. 

Hmm, if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y does, then z and y can't be touching at the point where y touches the boundary of x. But they could be touching elsewhere. So NTPP(z,x) is possible, but only if z touches y at a point inside x, not on the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning for NTPP(z,x) again. I think I've been clear: NTPP(z,x) means that z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. If y touches the boundary of x, and z touches y, we need to consider where exactly z touches y. If z touches y at a point inside x, not on the boundary, then z can be a non-tangential proper part of x. 

Actually, I think I've been too conservative. Even if z touches y at the point where y touches the boundary of x, it doesn't necessarily mean z touches the boundary of x as well. The boundary of y could include points that are inside x (not on the boundary of x), and points that are on the boundary of x. So z could touch y at a point that's on the boundary of y but inside x.

But wait, if z touches y at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPP(z,x). So z can't touch y at that specific point. But z could touch y at another point on the boundary of y, one that's inside x, not on the boundary of x.

So, NTPP(z,x) is possible, but only if z touches y at a point inside x, not on the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Let me consider another possible relationship: DC(x,z). This would mean that x and z are disconnected and share no points. But if y is a tangential proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, then y and z share a boundary point. Since y is inside x, that boundary point is also part of x. This means x and z share a point, which contradicts them being disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

And what about NTPPi(x,z)? This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But we've already covered this case as NTPP(z,x). Similarly, TPPi(x,z) is the same as TPP(z,x).

What about EQ(x,z)? This would mean that x and z are equal. If x and z were equal, then y would be a tangential proper part of both, and y would touch the boundary of z. But if y touches the boundary of z and y is inside z, then y can't be externally connected to z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

So, the answer is: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, hang on. I've been thinking about this and I'm now having doubts about the possibility of NTPP(z,x).

Let's go back to the original constraints:
1. TPPi(x,y) - y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z) - y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, NTPP(z,x) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary, can y and z be externally connected?

Let's think about it: If y and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. So there must be at least one point that is on the boundary of both y and z.

Call this point p. p is on the boundary of y, and p is on the boundary of z. Since y is inside x, p is a point of x. Is p on the boundary of x or in the interior of x?

If p is on the boundary of x, then z touches the boundary of x at p, which contradicts NTPP(z,x). So p must be in the interior of x.

But if p is in the interior of x and on the boundary of y, then y has a boundary point that is not on the boundary of x. This contradicts the definition of TPPi(x,y), which says that y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

In fact, the definition of TPP/TPPi says that the part entity touches the boundary of the whole entity. This means that every boundary point of the part entity that isn't shared with the whole entity must touch the boundary of the whole entity. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then every boundary point of y that isn't also a boundary point of x must touch the boundary of x.

So, if p is a boundary point of y and p is in the interior of x, then p must touch the boundary of x. But if p is also a boundary point of z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then p can't touch the boundary of x either. This is a contradiction.

So, NTPP(z,x) is actually not possible.

Wait, I think I'm making things more complicated than they are. Let me try to simplify my reasoning.

First, I'll note that "z doesn't touch the boundary of x" doesn't mean that every point of z is a certain distance away from the boundary of x. It just means there's no point that's on both the boundary of z and the boundary of x.

If p is a point on the boundary of y and on the boundary of z, it doesn't mean p is also on the boundary of x. p could be in the interior of x. This doesn't contradict TPPi(x,y), which just says that y touches the boundary of x, not that every boundary point of y is on the boundary of x.

So, NTPP(z,x) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, wait. I think I'm still getting confused because I'm overthinking this. Let's think about it in simpler terms.

Given TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

Given EC(y,z), we know that y and z are externally connected. This means they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, let's consider NTPP(z,x). This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

If z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, can y and z be externally connected?

If y and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries. Let's call a point where they touch p. p is on the boundary of y and on the boundary of z.

Since y is inside x, p is a point of x. Since z is inside x, p is a point of the interior of x (not on the boundary of x).

So, p is a point on the boundary of y, and p is in the interior of x. This doesn't contradict TPPi(x,y), which just says that y touches the boundary of x, not that every boundary point of y is on the boundary of x.

And p is a point on the boundary of z, and p is in the interior of x. This doesn't contradict NTPP(z,x), which just says that z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, NTPP(z,x) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

I think I can make this clearer if I draw some pictures:

For EC(x,z):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y|  |
    +--+-+--+
       |z|
       +-+
```

For PO(x,z):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y|  |
    +--+-+--+
    |  |z|  |
    +--+-+--+
```

For TPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y|  |
    +--+-+--+
    |z |    |
    +--+    |
    |       |
    +-------+
```

For NTPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y|  |
    |  +-+  |
    |   |   |
    | +-+   |
    | |z|   |
    | +-+   |
    |       |
    +-------+
```

But wait, I think my drawing for NTPP(z,x) is wrong. It doesn't show y and z touching. Let me redraw it:

For NTPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y+-+|
    |  +---+|
    |    |z||
    |    +-+|
    |       |
    +-------+
```

This shows y and z touching at a boundary, but z doesn't touch the boundary of x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x.

Wait, I'm now a little confused about my own drawing. Let me redraw it:

For NTPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +--+ |
    |  |y | |
    |  | | |
    |  +-++ |
    |    |z||
    |    +-+|
    |       |
    +-------+
```

Here, y touches the boundary of x, and y and z touch at their boundaries, but z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, NTPP(z,x) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

However, I'm now questioning my thinking on the whole problem because it seems like TPP(z,x) is only possible in a very specific case. Let's reconsider:

TPP(z,x) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

If z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, can y and z be externally connected?

If y and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries. Let's call a point where they touch p. p is on the boundary of y and on the boundary of z.

If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches the boundary of x. So there's a point q that is on the boundary of z and on the boundary of x.

But z can't overlap with y because they're externally connected. So the point p where y and z touch must be different from the point q where z touches the boundary of x. But if z isn't overlapping with y, and z touches the boundary of x at a different point from where y touches the boundary of x, then how can y and z be externally connected?

Unless... y touches the boundary of x at multiple points, and one of those points is also where z touches the boundary of x. Then y and z could be externally connected at that point.

So TPP(z,x) is possible, but only if y and z touch the boundary of x at the same point.

Actually, I'm overthinking. Tangentially connected objects don't have to touch at just a single point. y could touch the boundary of x along a line segment, and z could touch the boundary of x along a different line segment. y and z can still be externally connected as long as they touch at a point (which could be in the interior of x, or on the boundary of x). So TPP(z,x) is certainly possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Let me quickly re-verify each of these. I'm going to draw some pictures that more clearly illustrate each case, showing how the constraints TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are satisfied.

For EC(x,z):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y|  |
    +--+-+--+
       |
     +-+-+
     |z  |
     +---+
```
Here, y is a tangential proper part of x, and y and z are externally connected. x and z are also externally connected.

For PO(x,z):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y|  |
    +--+-+--+
    |  |   |
    +--+---+
    |  z   |
    +------+
```
Here, y is a tangential proper part of x, and y and z are externally connected. x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+

Here, y is a tangential proper part of x, and y and z are externally connected. z is a tangential proper part of x.

For NTPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y|  |

    | +-+   |
    | |z|   |
    | +-+   |
    |       |
    +-------+
```
But wait, this doesn't show y and z touching. Let me redraw it:

For NTPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  +--+ |
    |  |y | |
    |  | | |
    |  +-++ |
    |    |z||
    |    +-+|
    |       |
    +-------+
```
Here, y is a tangential proper part of x, and y and z are externally connected. z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

But I'm still not satisfied with my drawing for NTPP(z,x). Let me try again:

For NTPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |       |
    |  +--+ |
    |  |y | |
    |  +--+ |
    |   |   |
    | +-+   |
    | |z|   |
    | +-+   |
    |       |
    +-------+
```

No, that's still not right. Let me try once more:

For NTPP(z,x):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |       |
    |  +--+ |
    |  |y | |
    |  +--+ |
    |   |   |
    |   +-+ |
    |   |z| |
    |   +-+ |
    |       |
    +-------+
```

That's still wrong. Let me try a different approach. Let's describe it in words.

For NTPP(z,x), z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. y and z touch at their boundaries. 

Actually, I think I know what's wrong with my diagram. I can't draw it in a 2D ASCII format because the constraint that y and z touch at their boundaries while z doesn't touch the boundary of x requires a more complex picture.

So, let's stick with the verbal description: For NTPP(z,x), z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. y and z touch at their boundaries, but at a point that's inside x, not on the boundary of x.

I think it's become clear that NTPP(z,x) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Let me make sure I've analyzed all the possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected. Not possible because if y touches z and y is inside x, then z must also touch x.

2. EC(x,z): Externally connected. Possible as shown above.

3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. Possible as shown above.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. Not possible because if x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y is inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. Possible as shown above.

6. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

7. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Possible as discussed above.

8. EQ(x,z): Equal. Not possible because if x and z were equal, then y would be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me double-check EC(x,z). 

I said this was possible: if y touches the boundary of x, and y touches z, it's possible for z to touch x only at the boundary, making them externally connected.

Let me verify: EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

For EC(x,z) to be possible, z must touch the boundary of x, but not share any interior parts with x. But if y is inside x and y touches z, then z must share at least one point with the interior of x, which contradicts EC(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm mistaken, or at least I'm being imprecise. EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. It doesn't mean z doesn't have any interior points that are also points of x. It means x and z don't have any interior points in common.

So, if z touches the boundary of x, but doesn't extend into the interior of x, then x and z are externally connected. And this is possible even if y is inside x and y touches z, as long as y touches z at the point where z touches the boundary of x.

Let me redraw the picture for EC(x,z) to make sure:

```
    +-------+
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |       |
    |       |
    |  +-+  |
    |  |y|  |
    +--+-+--+
       |
     +-+-+
     |z  |
     +---+
```

Here, y is a tangential proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x. z is outside x, but touches x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. So y and z are externally connected, and x and z are also externally connected.

So, EC(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

So, my final answer is: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to consider what constraints are placed on the relationship between x and z, given that TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x - in other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected - they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. If y touches z and y is inside x, then z must touch x at least at the point where it touches y.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. z can touch x exactly at the boundary point where y also touches the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z can partially overlap with x, with part of z outside x and part inside, touching y at the boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z, then y would be inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPP(x,z).

6. TPP(z,x): Possible. z can be inside x, touching x's boundary, and also touching y at their boundaries.

7. NTPP(z,x): Possible. z can be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) while still touching y at a boundary point that's in the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)
