PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step. We're given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are equal (they occupy exactly the same space)

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), this means that y and z are the same region. They have the same boundaries and the same interior. Any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that EC(x,y), and y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the relationship between x and z must also be EC.

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is:
EC(x,z)

This is the only possibility given the constraints.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Since EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are identical regions - they have the same boundary and the same interior.

Because z is identical to y (they occupy exactly the same space), and x is externally connected to y, x must also be externally connected to z in exactly the same way.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
