PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, if y is completely inside x, and z is completely inside y, then z must also be completely inside x. Furthermore, since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z definitely won't touch x's boundary.

So, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I got confused about the order. Let me double-check.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, if z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z is definitely inside x. And since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z definitely won't touch x's boundary.

So, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

To double-check, let's think about a concrete example. Imagine:

- x is a large circle
- y is a medium circle inside x, not touching x's boundary
- z is a small circle inside y, not touching y's boundary

In this scenario, z is also inside x and not touching x's boundary, which confirms our reasoning.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,x)).

Hmm, I'm having some doubts. Let me try a different approach.

Let's recall the meanings of the relations:

- DC(a,b): a and b are disconnected
- EC(a,b): a and b are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap)
- PO(a,b): a and b partially overlap
- TPP(a,b): a is a tangential proper part of b (a is inside b and touches b's boundary)
- NTPP(a,b): a is a non-tangential proper part of b (a is inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary)
- TPPi(a,b): b is a tangential proper part of a (same as TPP(b,a))
- NTPPi(a,b): b is a non-tangential proper part of a (same as NTPP(b,a))
- EQ(a,b): a and b are equal

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y

I want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

As I reasoned earlier, if z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, then z must be completely inside x. Furthermore, z cannot touch x's boundary because there's "buffer space" provided by y.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I'm confident that this is the correct answer, but let me double-check by considering the other possible relations and seeing if any of them could hold:

- DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z must be inside x. Thus, x and z are not disconnected.

- EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary. So, x and z are not externally connected.

- PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, z must be completely inside x, not just partially. So, x and z do not partially overlap.

- TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts our knowledge that z is inside y, which is inside x. So, x is not a tangential proper part of z.

- NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, this contradicts our knowledge that z is inside y, which is inside x. So, x is not a non-tangential proper part of z.

- TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. While z is indeed inside x, it cannot touch x's boundary because there's "buffer space" provided by y. So, z is not a tangential proper part of x.

- NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. As I reasoned earlier, this is consistent with our given conditions. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a valid relation.

- EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z must be strictly inside x, not equal to x. So, x and z are not equal.

From this analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,x)).

Hmm, let me double-check my logic once more, because I think I'm getting confused between NTPPi and NTPP.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
- y is strictly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

From these, we can infer:
- z is strictly inside x (because z is inside y, which is inside x).
- z doesn't touch x's boundary (because z doesn't even touch y's boundary, which is inside x).

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Let me go through the relations systematically again:

- DC(x,z): No, x and z are not disconnected. They definitely overlap, since z is inside y, which is inside x.

- EC(x,z): No, x and z don't just touch at their boundaries. z is strictly inside x.

- PO(x,z): No, x and z don't just partially overlap. z is strictly inside x.

- TPP(x,z): No, x is not a tangential proper part of z. In fact, it's the other way around; z is inside x.

- NTPP(x,z): No, x is not a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, it's the other way around.

- TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, or z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know z is inside y, which is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary). So, z cannot touch x's boundary. Hence, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with our given conditions. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a valid relation.

- EQ(x,z): No, x and z are not equal. z is strictly inside x.

From this thorough analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,x)).

Actually, wait. I think I should double-check with a concrete geometric example to ensure my reasoning is correct.

Let's say:
- x is a large circle with center at (0,0) and radius 10.
- y is a medium circle with center at (0,0) and radius 5 (so it's strictly inside x).
- z is a small circle with center at (0,0) and radius 2 (so it's strictly inside y).

In this scenario:
- y doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds.
- z doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPPi(y,z) holds.
- z is strictly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

This confirms my reasoning.

Hmm, I think I made a careless error. Let me state the definitions of the relations again:

- NTPP(a,b): a is a non-tangential proper part of b (a is strictly inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary).
- NTPPi(a,b): b is a non-tangential proper part of a (same as NTPP(b,a)).

So, NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, if y is strictly inside x and z is strictly inside y, then z is definitely strictly inside x. And since there's "buffer space" between z and y's boundary, and between y and x's boundary, there's definitely "buffer space" between z and x's boundary. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, NTPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, now I'm second-guessing myself again. Let me be ultra-clear with the definitions:

- NTPP(a,b): a is a proper part of b (a is strictly inside b) and a does not touch the boundary of b.
- NTPPi(a,b): b is a proper part of a (b is strictly inside a) and b does not touch the boundary of a.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is strictly inside x and y doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is strictly inside y and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

From these, I infer:
- z is strictly inside y, which is strictly inside x, so z is strictly inside x.
- z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, so z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is strictly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, this still doesn't feel secure. Let me think more carefully and use a visual example to make sure.

NTPPi(x, y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. I can visualize this as y being completely inside x without touching the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y, z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. I can visualize this as z being completely inside y without touching the boundary of y.

Now, if z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z is definitely inside x.

But I need to be careful about the boundary. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, there's a "buffer space" between z and x's boundary. So, z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z, x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x, z).

But I should also consider the possibility of other relations.

For example, could EQ(x, z) be possible? This would mean x and z are exactly the same. But we know z is strictly inside y and y is strictly inside x, so x and z can't be the same.

Could PO(x, z) be possible? This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since z is strictly inside x, they don't just partially overlap; z is completely inside x.

Could TPPi(x, z) be possible? This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know z is inside y and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), so z can't touch x's boundary.

Could NTPP(x, z) be possible? This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts the fact that z is inside y, which is inside x.

And so on for the other relations. I've exhaustively checked all the RCC-8 relations, and the only one that's consistent with our given conditions is NTPPi(x, z).

Therefore, the answer is: the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, I'm getting confused again with the notation. Let me state the definitions in plain English, which might help:

- NTPP(a, b): a is completely inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary.
- NTPPi(a, b): b is completely inside a and doesn't touch a's boundary.

Given:
- NTPPi(x, y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

We want to know the relationship between x and z.

From our conditions, z is inside y, which is inside x. So, z is definitely inside x. And since z doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z definitely doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This corresponds to NTPP(z, x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x, z).

I'm now very confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

But let me, just for the sake of thoroughness, check if there's any other relation that might be possible:

- DC(x, z): No, x and z are not disconnected. z is inside x.
- EC(x, z): No, x and z don't just touch at their boundaries. z is inside x.
- PO(x, z): No, x and z don't partially overlap. z is completely inside x.
- TPP(x, z): No, x is not a tangential proper part of z. It's the other way around.
- NTPP(x, z): No, x is not a non-tangential proper part of z. It's the other way around.
- TPPi(x, z): No, z is not a tangential proper part of x. z doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x, z): Yes, z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the relation I've been describing.
- EQ(x, z): No, x and z are not equal. z is strictly inside x.

So, after a very thorough check, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually I just realized I should consider the reverse case as well, which is NTPP(x, z) or equivalently, NTPPi(z, x). Could it be possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?

Well, let's think about it. We know y is inside x, and z is inside y. So, x is not inside z. Instead, z is inside x. So, NTPP(x, z) is not possible.

Actually, checking every relation:

- DC(x, z): No, x and z are not disconnected. They overlap (specifically, z is inside x).
- EC(x, z): No, x and z don't just touch at their boundaries. They overlap (z is inside x).
- PO(x, z): No, x and z don't partially overlap. z is completely inside x.
- TPP(x, z): No, x is not a tangential proper part of z. In fact, it's the opposite; z is inside x.
- NTPP(x, z): No, x is not a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, it's the opposite.
- TPPi(x, z): No, z is not a tangential proper part of x. z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x, z): Yes, z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the relation I've been describing.
- EQ(x, z): No, x and z are not equal. z is strictly inside x.

I'm now absolutely confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually wait. I need to be certain that TPPi(x,z) is not possible. TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Given:
- NTPPi(x, y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

From these, we know:
- z is inside y, which is inside x. So, z is inside x.
- z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary.

Now, for z to touch x's boundary, it would have to first touch y's boundary (since y is between z and x). But we know z doesn't touch y's boundary. So, z can't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, TPPi(x, z) is not possible. The only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Let me do a final check.

Given:
- NTPPi(x, y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

From these, we infer:
- z is inside y, which is inside x. So, z is inside x.
- z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary. So, z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is represented as NTPP(z, x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x, z).

I'm now 100% confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, let's do it once more just to be sure:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, y is strictly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

From these, we can infer:
- z is strictly inside y, which is strictly inside x. So, z is strictly inside x.
- z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary. So, z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Let's double-check by going through all the RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,z): No, x and z are not disconnected. They overlap (z is inside x).
- EC(x,z): No, x and z don't just touch at their boundaries. They overlap (z is inside x).
- PO(x,z): No, x and z don't partially overlap. z is completely inside x.
- TPP(x,z): No, x is not a tangential proper part of z. It's the opposite.
- NTPP(x,z): No, x is not a non-tangential proper part of z. It's the opposite.
- TPPi(x,z): No, z is not a tangential proper part of x. z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): Yes, z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the relation I've been describing.
- EQ(x,z): No, x and z are not equal. z is strictly inside x.

So, after a thorough check, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship must hold between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

From these relations, I can deduce:
- Since z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- And y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- Therefore z must be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)

This situation exactly describes the NTPPi relation between x and z.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
