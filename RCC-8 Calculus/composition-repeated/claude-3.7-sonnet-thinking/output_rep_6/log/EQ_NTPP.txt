PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this question logically.

We are given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary

Now we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same spatial region. This means x has exactly the same spatial properties as y in relation to any other region.

Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x must also be completely contained within z and not touching z's boundary.

This directly corresponds to the definition of NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

To double-check this:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical regions
- NTPP(y,z) means y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary
- Therefore x must also be strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary
- This is precisely the definition of NTPP(x,z)

The answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relation holds between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x and y are coincident (they are the same region), and y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, it follows that x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

This corresponds precisely to the definition of NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
