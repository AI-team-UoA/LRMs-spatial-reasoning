PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine all possible relationships between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's recall what EC means: EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

So we know that:
- x touches y at a boundary without sharing interior
- y touches z at a boundary without sharing interior

Now I need to consider what relationship x and z could have. Let's go through all 8 RCC-8 relations systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Let's think about some examples:

Example 1: Imagine three regions where x touches y on the left, and y touches z on the right. In this case, x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) is possible.

Example 2: Imagine three regions in a row, where x touches y at a point, and y touches z at a point, and these points are the same. In this case, x and z would also touch at this same point, so EC(x,z) is possible.

Example 3: Consider regions where x and z both touch y from different directions, but also have some overlap with each other. Then PO(x,z) is possible.

Example 4: If z is a large region, y is at its boundary, and x is a small region that touches y but is completely inside z, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

Example 5: It's not possible for x to be completely inside z without touching its boundary (NTPP) while also touching y which touches z at its boundary.

Example 6: If x is a large region, y is at its boundary, and z is a small region that touches y but is completely inside x, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Example 7: Similar to #5, it's not possible for z to be completely inside x without touching its boundary (NTPPi) while also touching y which touches x at its boundary.

Example 8: It's not possible for x and z to be equal (EQ) while both being externally connected to y, as this would mean y is touching the same region from two different places.

Let me double-check my reasoning for the problematic cases:

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, how could x touch y, which touches z's boundary? This doesn't seem geometrically possible, so NTPP(x,z) is not a valid relation in this scenario.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, how could z touch y, which touches x's boundary? This also doesn't seem possible, so NTPPi(x,z) is not valid.

For EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, and both touch y externally, this would mean y touches the same region at two different places, which is fine. So EQ(x,z) is actually possible.

Wait, let me think more carefully about EQ(x,z). If x = z, and EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then we're saying EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). But that doesn't seem right - if y touches x externally, then x also touches y externally, but these are the same relationship (just stated from different perspectives), not two different facts. So I think EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility here.

I think I need to be more systematic. Let me reason through this again.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries

I need to find all possible relations between x and z. I'll think in terms of concrete spatial arrangements.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is definitely possible. Imagine three blocks in a row - x, y, z - where x touches y and y touches z, but x and z don't touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is also possible. Imagine three blocks arranged in a triangle, where each touches the other two at corners or edges.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Imagine y as a crescent shape, with x and z as overlapping circles that each touch part of the crescent.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y and y touches z, it's possible for x to be inside z and touch z's boundary at the same point where y touches z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But if x touches y, and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary (at the same point). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. By similar reasoning as #4, this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. By similar reasoning as #5, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x = z, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,x) would be the same statement, not two different constraints. So EQ(x,z) is not possible in this scenario.

Let me check the questionable cases again:

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, but x touches y, and y touches z's boundary, then x would be touching y inside z. But since y touches z's boundary, and x touches y, x would have to touch z's boundary as well (through the point where y touches z), which contradicts NTPP. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me think about this differently.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries. But these could be at different parts of y's boundary. For example, y could touch x on its left and touch z on its right.

So let's reconsider:

5. NTPP(x,z): Could x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while touching y, which touches z's boundary? Yes, this is possible. Imagine z as a large circle, y as a small circle touching z from the inside, and x as an even smaller circle inside z that touches y but is far from z's boundary.

Wait, I need to be more careful. If y touches z from the inside, that means y is part of z (either TPP or NTPP), not EC(y,z). EC means they touch but don't share interior points.

So for NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z. For EC(x,y) to be true, x must touch y at the boundary. And for EC(y,z) to be true, y must touch z at the boundary. But if y touches z at the boundary (from the outside), how can x both touch y and be completely inside z? This doesn't seem possible.

Let me re-examine with a clearer understanding:

For NTPP(x,z):
- NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary
- EC(x,y) means x touches y at their boundaries
- EC(y,z) means y touches z at their boundaries

If y touches z at their boundaries, and x touches y at their boundaries, but x is completely inside z... this creates a contradiction. If x is completely inside z, it can't touch something (y) that touches z from the outside. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

By similar reasoning, NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Let me think again about EQ(x,z):

For EQ(x,z):
- EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region
- EC(x,y) means x touches y at their boundaries
- EC(y,z) means y touches z at their boundaries

If x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are saying the same thing: y touches this region at the boundary. This is consistent, so EQ(x,z) is actually possible.

Actually, I need to think more carefully about EQ(x,z). If x and z are the same region, then the two givens EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) become EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). But these are equivalent statements (they're just saying x and y touch, from different perspectives), so they don't give us two independent constraints. So I think EQ(x,z) should not be listed as a possible answer, because the problem setup wouldn't make sense if x and z were the same region.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x

Let me verify once more that NTPP, NTPPi, and EQ are indeed impossible:

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at x's boundary, and y touches z at y's boundary, we get a contradiction. If y touches z at their boundaries, y must be at least partially outside z. But then, if x touches y, x must also be at least partially outside z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
By similar reasoning, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, we get a contradiction with the facts that z touches y and y touches x.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are saying the same thing twice, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. So I don't think EQ(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) with concrete examples:

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large square, y as a small square outside z but touching it at one point, and x as a small square that is inside z, touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches z. This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large square, y as a small square outside x but touching it at one point, and z as a small square that is inside x, touches x's boundary at the same point where y touches x. This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Wait, I made an error in the TPPi case. I described a scenario where EC(x,y) and EC(y,x) are satisfied, not EC(y,z). Let me correct this:

For TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large square, z as a small square inside x touching x's boundary, and y as a small square that touches both x and z at the point where z touches x's boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

One more check on the TPP case:

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large square, x as a small square inside z touching z's boundary, and y as a small square that touches both x and z at the point where x touches z's boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm still confused about the TPP and TPPi cases. Let me re-examine the definitions and think more carefully.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

For TPP(x,z):
- x is inside z and touches z's boundary
- x touches y at x's boundary
- y touches z at y's boundary

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is outside z but touches z's boundary, can x and y touch? Yes, they could touch at the point where both x and y touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
- z is inside x and touches x's boundary
- x touches y at x's boundary
- y touches z at y's boundary

If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is outside x but touches x's boundary, can y and z touch? Yes, they could touch at the point where both z and y touch x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

So my previous conclusion is correct: the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Hmm, let me think again. Maybe I'm getting confused about the boundaries.

Let me re-examine the TPP(x,z) case:
- TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z
- EC(x,y) means x touches y at their boundaries
- EC(y,z) means y touches z at their boundaries

If x is a part of z (whether tangential or not), and y touches z from the outside, can x touch y? If x touches the boundary of z at the same point where y touches z from the outside, then x and y would indeed touch. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, TPPi(x,z) is possible if z touches the boundary of x at the same point where y touches x from the outside.

So my final answer remains:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

To be completely sure, let me draw out a visual for each of these cases:

DC(x,z): Imagine x on the left, z on the right, and y in the middle. x touches y on the right, y touches z on the left, but x and z are separated.

EC(x,z): Imagine x, y, and z arranged in a triangle, each touching the other two.

PO(x,z): Imagine x and z as overlapping circles, and y as a third circle that touches both x and z at the points where they don't overlap.

TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, x as a small circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and y as a circle outside z that touches z's boundary at the same point where x touches it.

TPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, z as a small circle inside x that touches x's boundary, and y as a circle outside x that touches x's boundary at the same point where z touches it.

Actually, I'm still confusing myself with the TPP and TPPi cases. Let me step back and define TPP more clearly:

TPP(x,z) means:
1. x is a proper part of z (i.e., all of x is inside z, but z is not inside x)
2. x touches the boundary of z (i.e., some part of x is at the boundary of z)

TPPi(x,z) means:
1. z is a proper part of x (i.e., all of z is inside x, but x is not inside z)
2. z touches the boundary of x (i.e., some part of z is at the boundary of x)

Now, let me rethink the TPP(x,z) case:
- TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary
- EC(x,y) means x touches y at their boundaries
- EC(y,z) means y touches z at their boundaries

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches z from the outside, can x and y touch? They would have to touch at a point where both x and y touch z's boundary. But since x is inside z and y is outside z, they are separated by z's boundary, so they can't touch. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

By similar reasoning, TPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

So my revised conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually I'm still not thinking about this clearly. Let me more carefully describe what a "boundary" means in the context of TPP.

If TPP(x,z), x is inside z and some part of x touches the boundary of z. The boundary of z is the interface between the inside of z and the outside of z. So if x touches this boundary, it means some part of x is at this interface.

Now, if EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. This means some part of y's boundary touches some part of z's boundary, but their interiors don't overlap.

So can x and y touch? If x is inside z and touches z's boundary at a point, and y is outside z and touches z's boundary at a point, they might touch if these are the same point. But that would mean x and y are touching through a point on z's boundary, which doesn't seem right because the boundary of z should separate the inside (where x is) from the outside (where y is).

I think I need to clarify what "touch" means in this context. "Touch" means the boundaries overlap, but the interiors don't. The boundary of a region is a lower-dimensional entity than the region itself. For example, in 2D, the boundary of a region is a 1D curve, and in 3D, the boundary of a region is a 2D surface.

So, if x and z's interiors overlap (as in TPP(x,z)), and y and z's boundaries touch, can x and y's boundaries touch? I think they can, because we're talking about boundaries touching, not interiors overlapping.

For TPP(x,z), imagine z as a circle, x as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point, and y as a circle outside z that touches z's boundary at the same point. In this scenario, x and y would touch at a single point, which is the point where both x and z's boundaries meet.

So I think TPP(x,z) is possible after all.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), imagine x as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at a point, and y as a circle outside x that touches x's boundary at the same point. In this scenario, y and z would touch at a single point, which is the point where both x and z's boundaries meet.

So TPPi(x,z) is also possible.

So my original conclusion was correct: the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, I realize now that the picture I've been trying to draw for TPP and TPPi doesn't quite make sense. Let me try again.

For TPP(x,z):
- TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary
- EC(x,y) means x touches y at their boundaries
- EC(y,z) means y touches z at their boundaries

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is outside z but touches z's boundary, can x and y touch? If they touch, it would have to be at a point on z's boundary. But is this possible? The boundary is supposed to separate the inside from the outside.

Let me think about this in terms of a concrete example. Imagine z as a circle, x as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point p, and y as a circle outside z that touches z's boundary at point p as well.

Actually, I think what I was describing wouldn't actually be "touching" in the EC sense. The point p is on z's boundary, but it's not a common point of both x and y. x touches z at p, and y touches z at p, but x and y themselves don't share a point.

For x and y to touch (EC), they need to share a boundary point, which isn't possible if x is inside z and y is outside z, because z's boundary separates them.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

By similar reasoning, TPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

So my revised conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, let me confirm this with a counter-example for TPP. If we have:
- A large circle z
- A small circle x inside z, touching z's boundary at point p
- A small circle y outside z, touching z's boundary at point p

Are x and y touching? They both touch z at the same point p, but do they touch each other? They're on opposite sides of z's boundary, so they don't share any points. So in this scenario, EC(x,y) is not satisfied.

So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation, and by similar reasoning, neither is TPPi(x,z).

So the possible relations are indeed:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

I realized I misunderstood how TPP and TPPi work. Let me clarify my thinking to be absolutely sure.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is completely inside z, and x touches the boundary of z.

If TPP(x,z), and EC(x,y), and EC(y,z), we're saying:
- x is inside z and touches z's boundary
- x touches y at their boundaries
- y touches z at their boundaries

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches z at their boundaries, can x and y touch at their boundaries? They would have to touch at a point on z's boundary. But if x is inside z and y is outside z, they are separated by z's boundary, so they can't touch.

Unless... perhaps the boundaries can touch at a point without the interiors overlapping? But no, the boundary of z separates the inside of z from the outside of z. If x is inside z and y is outside z, their boundaries can't touch through z's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible, and by similar reasoning, TPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

So the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, let me think of TPP in a concrete way. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. An example would be a circle x inside a larger circle z, where x touches the boundary of z at a point.

Now, if EC(x,y), x touches y at a point. And if EC(y,z), y touches z at a point.

Could both these points be the same? If x touches z at point p, and y touches z at point p, does that mean x touches y? I think not. If x is inside z and y is outside z, they are separated by z's boundary. The fact that both touch z at the same point doesn't mean they touch each other; they're on opposite sides of z's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) are not possible relations.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, let me make sure I'm thinking about this right. In RCC-8, regions are typically considered to be regular closed sets, which means they include their boundaries. The relation EC(x,y) means that the interiors of x and y are disjoint, but their boundaries intersect.

So let's think about this again:

If TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary. The point where x touches z's boundary is part of both x and z.

If EC(y,z), y and z's interiors are disjoint, but their boundaries intersect. The points where y and z's boundaries intersect are part of both y and z.

Could x and y touch at a point? If x touches z at point p, and y touches z at point p, then p is part of x, y, and z. So x and y would indeed share a point, which means they could be EC.

But wait, is this right? If p is on z's boundary, and x is inside z, and y is outside z, how can p be part of both x and y? The boundary of z is supposed to separate the inside of z from the outside of z.

Ok, I need to be more precise about what it means for a point to be on the boundary of a region. The boundary of a region consists of the points that are in the closure of the region but not in its interior. If p is on the boundary of z, it means p is in the closure of z, but not in the interior of z.

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary at p, it means p is in the closure of x and also on the boundary of z. And if y is outside z but touches z's boundary at p, it means p is in the closure of y and also on the boundary of z.

So p is in the closure of both x and y. But does that mean x and y touch? For EC(x,y), we need the interiors of x and y to be disjoint, but their boundaries to intersect. If p is on the boundary of both x and y, then their boundaries do intersect.

But I'm still not convinced. If x is inside z and y is outside z, how can they share a boundary point? The boundary of z should separate them.

Let me approach this differently. Consider a simple example: let z be a disk, x be a smaller disk inside z that touches z's boundary at a point p, and y be a disk outside z that touches z's boundary at the same point p.

Do x and y touch? They both touch z at the same point p, but are they touching each other? I think not. The boundary of z separates the inside of z from the outside of z. So x and y are separated by z's boundary, even at the point p where they both touch z.

So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation, and by similar reasoning, TPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me try to reason through it one more time, step by step.

1. If TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
2. If EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries, but their interiors are disjoint.
3. If EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors are disjoint.

Given these three conditions, can x and y touch at their boundaries? If x is inside z and touches z's boundary at a point, and y is outside z and touches z's boundary at a point, they could touch if both these points are the same. But is this possible?

Actually, I don't think so. If x is inside z and y is outside z, they are separated by z's boundary. Even if both x and y touch z's boundary at the same point, they don't touch each other directly. The boundary of z forms a barrier between them.

So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation, and by similar reasoning, TPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this by trying to reason about points. The RCC-8 calculus is about regions, not points. Let me think in terms of regions.

If TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. The interior of x is a subset of the interior of z.
2. The closure of x is not equal to the closure of z.
3. The boundary of x intersects the boundary of z.

If EC(x,y), x and y are externally connected. This means:
1. The interiors of x and y are disjoint.
2. The boundaries of x and y intersect.

If EC(y,z), y and z are externally connected. This means:
1. The interiors of y and z are disjoint.
2. The boundaries of y and z intersect.

Given these conditions, can TPP(x,z) be true? Let's check:
- If TPP(x,z), the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z.
- If EC(y,z), the interiors of y and z are disjoint.
- So the interiors of x and y are disjoint.

- If TPP(x,z), the boundary of x intersects the boundary of z.
- If EC(y,z), the boundary of y intersects the boundary of z.
- But this doesn't necessarily mean the boundaries of x and y intersect. They could intersect the boundary of z at different points.

So there's no contradiction here, and TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

Similarly, TPPi(x,z) is also a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check the TPP case. If TPP(x,z), the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, and the boundaries of x and z intersect.

If EC(x,y), the interiors of x and y are disjoint, and the boundaries of x and y intersect.

But wait... if the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, and the interiors of y and z are disjoint, then the interiors of x and y must be disjoint. And if the boundaries of x and z intersect, and the boundaries of y and z intersect, it's possible for the boundaries of x and y to intersect as well.

But is it really possible for the boundaries of x and y to intersect if one is inside z and the other is outside z? I think I need to be more careful about what "inside" and "outside" mean in the context of these relations.

"Inside" doesn't necessarily mean "fully enclosed by". It means the interior is a subset of the interior. And two boundaries can intersect even if one region is "inside" the other. The key point is that the boundary of a region separates the interior of the region from the exterior, but boundaries themselves can intersect.

So I believe my conclusion is correct:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Now let me check if NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible:

NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. The interior of x is a subset of the interior of z.
2. The closure of x is not equal to the closure of z.
3. The boundary of x does not intersect the boundary of z.

If NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries. If EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

But now we have a contradiction: if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is outside z but touches z's boundary, how can x and y touch? They are separated by the region between x and z's boundary, so they can't touch.

So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation, and by similar reasoning, NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

What about EQ(x,z)? EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), we'd have EC(x,y) and EC(y,x), which is just the same condition stated twice. This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, so EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think I might have overlooked something. Let me check again the TPP and TPPi cases.

If TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries. If EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

Here's the issue: if y touches z at their boundaries, y must be outside z (because EC means the interiors are disjoint). If x is inside z, and y is outside z, can x and y touch? They would have to touch at a point on z's boundary, which both x and y touch. But the boundary of z separates the inside of z from the outside of z, so x and y can't share a point.

So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation, and by similar reasoning, TPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, I think I've been confusing myself by thinking about points too much. The RCC-8 calculus is about regions, not points. Let me approach this differently.

If TPP(x,z), then the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, and the boundaries of x and z intersect.

If EC(x,y), then the interiors of x and y are disjoint, and the boundaries of x and y intersect.

If EC(y,z), then the interiors of y and z are disjoint, and the boundaries of y and z intersect.

Can these three conditions be satisfied simultaneously?

If the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, and the interiors of y and z are disjoint, then the interiors of x and y must be disjoint as well. So far, no contradiction.

Now, if the boundaries of x and z intersect, and the boundaries of y and z intersect, can the boundaries of x and y intersect? It's possible that there's a point p that's on the boundaries of all three regions. But if p is on the boundary of z, and x is inside z, and y is outside z, can p be on the boundaries of both x and y? This doesn't seem right, because the boundary of z should separate the inside of z (where x is) from the outside of z (where y is).

Let me think about this more concretely. Imagine z as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside z that touches z's boundary at a point p, and y as a disk outside z that touches z's boundary at the same point p.

In this scenario, p is on the boundaries of all three regions. But does this mean x and y touch? They both touch z at the same point p, but are they touching each other? I don't think so. The boundary of z forms a barrier between x and y, even at the point p.

So I believe TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation, and by similar reasoning, TPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Actually, I'm getting myself confused. Let me once and for all check if it's possible for TPP(x,z) to hold given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

TPP(x,z): All points inside x are inside z, and some boundary points of x are also boundary points of z.
EC(x,y): The interiors of x and y do not overlap, but their boundaries share some points.
EC(y,z): The interiors of y and z do not overlap, but their boundaries share some points.

Can all of these be true at the same time? If the interiors of y and z do not overlap, and all points inside x are inside z, then the interiors of x and y do not overlap. That's consistent with EC(x,y).

Now, if the boundaries of y and z share some points, and the boundaries of x and z share some points, can the boundaries of x and y share some points? In particular, can there be a point p that's on the boundaries of all three regions?

Well, if p is on the boundary of z, and x is inside z with p on the boundary of x, and y is outside z with p on the boundary of y, then p is indeed on the boundaries of all three regions. But does this mean x and y touch? They both touch z at the same point p, but are they touching each other?

I think they are. The boundaries of x and y both include the point p, so the boundaries of x and y intersect. And since the interiors of x and y don't overlap (because the interior of x is inside z and the interior of y is outside z), this meets the definition of EC(x,y).

So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation, and by similar reasoning, TPPi(x,z) is also a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Ok, I think my issue was that I was thinking of EC in terms of touching, but EC is more precisely defined as boundary intersection. Two regions are externally connected if their interiors are disjoint but their boundaries intersect. So if x, y, and z all share a boundary point, then EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z) are all true.

But wait... I need to check one more thing: if TPP(x,z), can EC(x,z) be true? TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, which means the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, and the boundaries of x and z intersect. EC(x,z) means the interiors of x and z are disjoint, and the boundaries of x and z intersect. But the interiors of x and z are not disjoint if TPP(x,z), so EC(x,z) and TPP(x,z) cannot be true at the same time.

So if TPP(x,z), then EC(x,z) is false. But the problem doesn't require EC(x,z) to be true; it only requires EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) to be true.

So my final conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Ok, I think I'm done. The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to systematically consider each of the eight RCC-8 relations.

First, let me recall what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts

Now let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is possible. Imagine x on the left, y in the middle, and z on the right, with y touching both but x and z not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: This is possible. Imagine x, y, and z arranged in a triangle where each touches the other two at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: This is possible. Imagine x and z as overlapping regions, with y touching both at their boundaries where they don't overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: This is possible. Imagine z as a large region, x as a small region inside z touching z's boundary at a point, and y touching both x and z at that same boundary point.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-Tangential Proper Part: This is not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, then y cannot touch x (since x doesn't reach z's boundary).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse Tangential Proper Part: This is possible. Similar to case 4 but with roles reversed: x is the larger region, z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches both at that same point.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part: This is not possible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y touches x at x's boundary, then y cannot touch z.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This is not possible. If x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) would be the same statement, which doesn't fit the premise of having two distinct relations.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
