PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between regions x and z, given:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap)
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)

Let me analyze this step by step:

1) EC(x,y) means:
   - x and y touch at their boundaries
   - Their interiors don't overlap

2) NTPPi(y,z) means:
   - z is completely contained within y
   - z doesn't touch y's boundary (it's properly inside)

Now I need to determine what relation x could have with z.

Given these constraints, let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, x cannot reach z. There would be some part of y separating x and z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
For x to touch z at their boundaries, z would need to reach y's boundary (where x touches y). But NTPPi(y,z) explicitly states that z doesn't touch y's boundary. Therefore, EC(x,z) is impossible.

PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
For x and z to partially overlap, x would need to penetrate into y's interior to reach z. But EC(x,y) means x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside. So PO(x,z) is impossible.

TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't go inside, while z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary. This arrangement makes TPP(x,z) impossible.

NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
This would require x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is even more impossible than TPP since x doesn't even go inside y.

TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse:
This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while x only touches y at the boundary. These constraints make TPPi(x,z) impossible.

NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse:
This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, since z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, this arrangement is impossible.

EQ(x,z) - Equal:
If x and z were equal, they would occupy the same space. But x touches y's boundary while z doesn't, so they can't be equal.

So, given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z) - disconnected.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning by visualizing this situation more carefully:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.

Now, consider all possibilities for x in relation to z:

DC(x,z): Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is completely inside y not touching y's boundary, there must be some part of y separating x and z. So DC(x,z) is definitely possible.

Let me think more carefully about EC(x,z). Could x somehow touch z while still only externally connecting with y? No, because if x touched z, then since z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), x would have to penetrate into y's interior to reach z. But EC(x,y) means x only touches y at the boundary without penetrating inside. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

The same reasoning applies to all other relations - they would require x to somehow interact with z, which is impossible given the constraints.

So my final answer is that the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z) - disconnected.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider the definition of NTPPi(y,z):

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part inverse of y.
This means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (not the other way around as I initially stated).

So the correct interpretation is:
- y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary)
- z contains y entirely, with some space between y's boundary and z's boundary

Let me re-analyze with this correct interpretation:

1) EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
2) NTPPi(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now for the possible relations between x and z:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
If x only touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x might still be completely outside z. This is possible if x only touches a part of y's boundary that is still separated from z's boundary. So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
If x touches y at the boundary, and y is contained within z but not touching z's boundary, then x could potentially touch z's boundary at a different point than where it touches y. This arrangement seems possible. So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
X could partially penetrate into z while still only touching y at the boundary. This would create a partial overlap between x and z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
X could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary, and still maintain its external connection with y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
X could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y at y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse:
This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary. For z to be inside x, x would have to completely envelop y, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse:
Similar to TPPi, this is impossible because x cannot contain z when x only touches y at the boundary and y is inside z.

EQ(x,z) - Equal:
If x and z were equal, they would occupy the same space. But x touches y at the boundary while z completely contains y without touching y's boundary. These are contradictory requirements, so EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, I think I'm still making some conceptual errors. Let me try a different approach by drawing simple diagrams in my mind:

For EC(x,y):
x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

For NTPPi(y,z):
z completely contains y, with some gap between y's boundary and z's boundary.

Now, for x and z:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
Is it possible for x to be completely outside z while touching y? No, because if y is properly inside z, and x touches y, then x must at least touch z as well. So actually DC(x,z) is impossible.

EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
Can x touch z's boundary without penetrating inside z, while also touching y's boundary? Yes, x could touch z's boundary exactly at the point where it also touches y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I'm making a logical error again. Let me be more precise about the definitions:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Oh, I see the issue. I was interpreting NTPPi incorrectly. Let me fix this:

NTPPi(y,z) means "y is the non-tangential proper part inverse of z"
This means: z is a non-tangential proper part of y
This means: z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary

OK so the correct setup is:
1) EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
2) NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Now let's analyze again:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
If x only touches y at the boundary, and z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), then there must be some part of y between x and z. So DC(x,z) is definitely possible and in fact necessary.

EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
For x to touch z, z would need to extend to y's boundary (where x touches y). But NTPPi(y,z) explicitly states that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
For x and z to overlap at all, x would need to penetrate into y to reach z. But EC(x,y) prevents this. So PO(x,z) is impossible.

TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
This would require x to be inside z, which is inside y. But x only touches y at the boundary, so TPP(x,z) is impossible.

NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
Similar to TPP, this is impossible because x can't be inside z.

TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse:
This would require z to be inside x. But z is inside y, and x only touches y at the boundary without penetrating inside. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse:
Similar to TPPi, this is impossible for the same reasons.

EQ(x,z) - Equal:
X and z would need to occupy the same space, but z is inside y while x only touches y's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z) - disconnected.

Actually, let me double-check once more with a concrete example:

Imagine:
- y is a circle
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- x is another region that touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y

In this scenario, x cannot reach z because z is separated from y's boundary. So x and z must be disconnected.

Therefore, given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

OK one last check. The definition of the RCC-8 relations is:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some points, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP)
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP)
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (occupy the same space)

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

For x and z:
Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is completely inside y not touching y's boundary, there must be some part of y separating x and z. Therefore, x and z cannot share any points, making DC(x,z) the only possible relation.

So my answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between regions x and z given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
- NTPPi(y,z): y contains z completely as a non-tangential proper part (z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Let's analyze this systematically:

Since x only touches y at the boundary (EC), and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary (NTPPi), there must be some part of y separating x and z. This means:

- x cannot overlap with z
- x cannot contain z
- x cannot be contained by z
- x cannot be equal to z
- x cannot even touch z

The only possible spatial relationship is that x and z are completely disconnected.
