PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

The eight relations in RCC-8 are:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no spatial parts)
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other
4. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary
5. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary
6. TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary
7. NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (completely overlap)

Now let's systematically check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   - We know x overlaps with y, and y overlaps with z
   - But it's still possible that x and z don't overlap at all
   - For example, imagine y as a shape that extends to cover parts of both x and z, but x and z themselves don't touch
   - So DC(x,z) is possible

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z touch at their boundaries?
   - Similar to the DC case, but now x and z just touch at their boundaries
   - This is definitely possible - y could overlap with parts of both x and z, and x and z could touch at their boundaries
   - So EC(x,z) is possible

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   - Yes, this is certainly possible
   - x overlaps with y, y overlaps with z, and x and z could overlap as well
   - So PO(x,z) is possible

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   - Yes, this could happen
   - x could overlap with y, y could overlap with z, and x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary
   - So TPP(x,z) is possible

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   - Yes, x could be completely inside z without touching its boundary
   - So NTPP(x,z) is possible

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   - Yes, z could be completely inside x while touching x's boundary
   - So TPPi(x,z) is possible

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   - Yes, z could be completely inside x without touching its boundary
   - So NTPPi(x,z) is possible

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   - Yes, x and z could be exactly the same region
   - Both would partially overlap with y
   - So EQ(x,z) is possible

All eight relations seem possible, but let me double-check with some concrete examples or visualizations:

Let's verify my reasoning with some simple visualizations:

DC(x,z): Imagine x on the left side of y, and z on the right side of y, with y overlapping both but x and z not touching.

EC(x,z): Similar to DC, but now x and z just touch at one point or along a boundary.

PO(x,z): x and z overlap in some region, but neither is fully contained in the other.

TPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. This means x is small compared to z, but y still needs to overlap with both. This works if y overlaps with a part of x and extends into z.

NTPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. Similar to TPP, but x is more interior to z.

TPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is the reverse of TPP.

NTPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. This is the reverse of NTPP.

EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. Both partially overlap with y.

I believe all of these scenarios are consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). So the answer is that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me double-check again with even more careful reasoning:

For DC(x,z): Imagine y as a dumbbell shape, with x overlapping the left bulb of the dumbbell and z overlapping the right bulb. X and z can be completely disconnected.

For EC(x,z): Similar to DC, but now x and z just touch at one point or along a boundary.

For PO(x,z): x and z share some region, but neither is contained in the other. This is clearly possible.

For TPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, can we still have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Yes, if y overlaps with part of x and extends outside of z. This works.

For NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, but x is completely inside z without touching the boundary. This is also possible.

For TPPi(x,z): Now z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible too.

For NTPPi(x,z): Z is completely inside x without touching the boundary. Also possible.

For EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. Both partially overlap with y. This is possible too.

So, after checking again, I confirm that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me just double-check my reasoning for some of the more tricky cases:

For TPP(x,z): 
- We need x to be completely inside z, touching z's boundary
- We need PO(x,y), so y overlaps with part of x but not all of x
- We need PO(y,z), so y overlaps with part of z but not all of z
This seems possible: y could overlap with part of x (satisfying PO(x,y)), and extend outside of z (ensuring PO(y,z)).

For NTPP(x,z):
- We need x to be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary
- Again, we need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)
This is also possible with a similar arrangement to TPP.

For TPPi(x,z):
- We need z to be completely inside x, touching x's boundary
- We need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)
This is possible: y could overlap with part of z (satisfying PO(y,z)), and extend outside of x (ensuring PO(x,y)).

For NTPPi(x,z):
- We need z to be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- We need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)
This is also possible with a similar arrangement to TPPi.

For EQ(x,z):
- We need x and z to be the same region
- We need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)
This is clearly possible since if x = z, then PO(x,y) implies PO(z,y).

So, after careful verification, I confirm that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let's be even more explicit and draw out some sample configurations for each case:

1. DC(x,z): 
```
   x      z
 /---\  /---\
|     ||     |
|  x  ||  z  |
|     ||     |
 \---/  \---/
    \    /
     \  /
      \/
      y
```
Here y extends to touch both x and z, but x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z):
```
   x        z
 /---\    /---\
|     |  |     |
|  x  |--|  z  |
|     |  |     |
 \---/    \---/
    \      /
     \    /
      \  /
       \/
       y
```
Here x and z touch at a boundary, and y overlaps with both.

3. PO(x,z):
```
   x        z
 /---\    /---\
|     |  |     |
|  x  |--|--|  |
|     |  |  |  |
 \---/    |  |
    \     |  |
     \    |  |
      \   |  |
       \  |  |
        \ |  |
         \|  |
          \---\
           y
```
Here x and z partially overlap, and y overlaps with both.

4. TPP(x,z):
```
       z
    /-----\
   |       |
   |   x   |
   |  /-\  |
   | |   | |
   |  \-/  |
   |   |   |
   |   |   |
    \--|--/
       |
       y
```
Here x is inside z touching z's boundary, and y overlaps with both.

5. NTPP(x,z):
```
       z
    /-----\
   |       |
   |       |
   |   x   |
   |  /-\  |
   | |   | |
   |  \-/  |
   |   |   |
    \--|--/
       |
       y
```
Here x is inside z not touching z's boundary, and y overlaps with both.

6. TPPi(x,z):
```
       x
    /-----\
   |       |
   |   z   |
   |  /-\  |
   | |   | |
   |  \-/  |
   |   |   |
   |   |   |
    \--|--/
       |
       y
```
Here z is inside x touching x's boundary, and y overlaps with both.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
```
       x
    /-----\
   |       |
   |       |
   |   z   |
   |  /-\  |
   | |   | |
   |  \-/  |
   |   |   |
    \--|--/
       |
       y
```
Here z is inside x not touching x's boundary, and y overlaps with both.

8. EQ(x,z):
```
     x=z
    /---\
   |     |
   |     |
   |     |
   |     |
    \-|-/
      |
      y
```
Here x and z are the same region, and y overlaps with both.

These diagrams confirm that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Therefore, the answer is that all eight relations are possible: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check a couple more of these diagrams to make sure they are consistent:

For TPP(x,z), we need:
- x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary
- PO(x,y): y overlaps with part of x but not all of x
- PO(y,z): y overlaps with part of z but not all of z

My diagram above has x inside z touching the boundary, and y overlapping with x. But I need to ensure y also overlaps with z but not completely. Let me revise:

```
        z
     /-----\
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  /-\  |
    | |   | |
    |  \-/  |
    |       |
     \-----/
        |
        y
```
Here, x is inside z touching z's boundary. Y overlaps with part of x, so PO(x,y). Y also extends outside of z, so PO(y,z).

Wait, this diagram doesn't work because y needs to overlap with z but not be contained in z. Let me try again:

```
        z
     /-----\
    |       |
    |   x   |
    |  /-\  |
    | |   | |
    |  \-/  |
    |   |   |
     \--|--/
        |
      /-|--\
     |  y   |
      \----/
```

Here, x is inside z touching z's boundary. Y overlaps with part of x (so PO(x,y)), and y also overlaps with part of z but not all of z (so PO(y,z)).

For NTPP(x,z), we need:
- x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary
- PO(x,y): y overlaps with part of x but not all of x
- PO(y,z): y overlaps with part of z but not all of z

```
        z
     /-------\
    |         |
    |    x    |
    |   /-\   |
    |  |   |  |
    |   \-/   |
    |    |    |
     \----|---/
          |
        /-|--\
       |  y   |
        \----/
```

Here, x is inside z not touching z's boundary. Y overlaps with part of x (so PO(x,y)), and y also overlaps with part of z but not all of z (so PO(y,z)).

For TPPi(x,z), we need:
- z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary
- PO(x,y): y overlaps with part of x but not all of x
- PO(y,z): y overlaps with part of z but not all of z

```
        x
     /-----\
    |       |
    |   z   |
    |  /-\  |
    | |   | |
    |  \-/  |
    |   |   |
     \--|--/
        |
      /-|--\
     |  y   |
      \----/
```

Here, z is inside x touching x's boundary. Y overlaps with part of z (so PO(y,z)), and y also overlaps with part of x but not all of x (so PO(x,y)).

For NTPPi(x,z), we need:
- z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary
- PO(x,y): y overlaps with part of x but not all of x
- PO(y,z): y overlaps with part of z but not all of z

```
        x
     /-------\
    |         |
    |    z    |
    |   /-\   |
    |  |   |  |
    |   \-/   |
    |    |    |
     \----|---/
          |
        /-|--\
       |  y   |
        \----/
```

Here, z is inside x not touching x's boundary. Y overlaps with part of z (so PO(y,z)), and y also overlaps with part of x but not all of x (so PO(x,y)).

I've confirmed that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, the answer is that all eight relations are possible: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Consider y as a "bridge" shape that overlaps with part of x on one side and part of z on the other, while x and z are completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. Similar to above, but x and z touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. X and z can share a region while y overlaps with parts of both.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. X can be completely inside z touching z's boundary, while y overlaps with part of x and extends outside of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. Similar to TPP, but x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. Z can be completely inside x touching x's boundary, while y overlaps with part of z and extends outside of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. Similar to TPPi, but z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. X and z can be identical, with y partially overlapping both.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
