PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step about this problem.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning that x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z inverted, which means that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., TPP(z,y). This means that z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we want to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z. Let's consider all of the RCC-8 relations and see which ones are possible.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not overlapping, and not touching. Since both x and z touch the boundary of y, it's possible for them to be in separate parts of the boundary.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
   This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. Since both x and z are within y and both touch y's boundary, they could touch each other at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. This can happen if x and z partially overlap inside y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Let's think about this. We know that z is a proper part of y, and x is a proper part of y. If x is entirely contained within z, and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is true. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) is true. This is possible if x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that z is a proper part of y, and x is also a proper part of y. For z to be a proper part of x, x would have to be at least as large as z, which is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to the above, this would mean z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, for z to be a proper part of x, x would have to be at least as large as z, which is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This would mean that x and z are the same region. This is possible if both x and z are the same proper part of y and both touch the boundary of y.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let's consider the relationships more carefully.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., TPP(z,y).

Let's verify each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x and z are both tangential proper parts of y, they could be located in different parts of y and not overlap or touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
   This is possible if x and z touch but don't have any interior parts in common.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if x and z have some interior parts in common, but neither is contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, this means that x would have to be smaller than z, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of z at some point. This is a plausible scenario.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, z would have to be larger than x, and x would have to be completely inside z without touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x. However, given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, x would have to be larger than z, and the boundary of z would have to touch the boundary of x at some point.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, x would have to be larger than z, and z would have to be completely inside x without touching its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This would mean that x and z are the same region. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, this is possible if x and z are exactly the same region.

Wait, I need to think even more carefully. Let's focus on what it means for TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) to be true.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. Proper part means that x is a subset of y and x â‰  y.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z inverted, which is the same as TPP(z,y). So z is a tangential proper part of y. 

Let's think about this geometrically: x is inside y and touches y's boundary; z is also inside y and touches y's boundary. 

But wait, that's not quite right. TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which would mean that TPP(z,y). But TPP(z,y) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. And TPPi(y,z) would mean y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, to be clear:
- TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So x is inside y, and y is inside z. By transitivity, x is inside z. But we need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z (TPP) or is entirely in the interior of z (NTPP).

If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y also touches the boundary of z, then x would also touch the boundary of z, making TPP(x,z) true. Otherwise, x would be entirely in the interior of z, making NTPP(x,z) true.

So, there are two possible relationships between x and z:
1. TPP(x,z): If x touches the boundary of z.
2. NTPP(x,z): If x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Actually, I need to be a bit more careful here. Let's think again.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my interpretation. Let me correct it.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means that TPP(z,y) is inverted. The inverse of "z is a tangential proper part of y" is "y is a tangential proper part of z." So, TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

So, we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

By transitivity, x is a proper part of z. But we need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z (TPP) or is entirely in the interior of z (NTPP).

If x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is true. If x is entirely in the interior of z, then NTPP(x,z) is true.

But how do we determine whether x touches the boundary of z?

Let's think about this: y touches the boundary of z. If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x would also touch the boundary of z. Otherwise, x would be entirely in the interior of z.

So, there are two possible relationships between x and z:
1. TPP(x,z): If x touches the boundary of z.
2. NTPP(x,z): If x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Actually, I made a mistake again. Let's reinterpret TPPi(y,z) correctly.

TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, x and z are both proper parts of y and both touch y's boundary. There are several possible relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze all RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y and don't touch.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch but don't have any interior parts in common.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

Wait, let me rethink this one more time:

TPP(x,y) means: x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z). The definition of TPP(y,z) is: y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. The inverse of this is: z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

x and z are both proper parts of y and both touch y's boundary. 

Oh, I see the issue I've been having. Let me refer to the definitions I was given:

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, both x and z are parts of y and both touch y's boundary. I should use these definitions from the problem statement to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Given that both x and z are proper parts of y and both touch y's boundary, they could be related in the following ways:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y and don't touch.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch but don't have any interior parts in common.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

All these relations are possible given the constraints that both x and z are proper parts of y and both touch y's boundary.

Actually, I need to redo this. I got confused about the interpretation of TPPi. Let me check the definition in the problem statement more carefully:

According to the problem, TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

But there's another definition given to us. TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. So, TPP(z,y) (which is the same as TPPi(y,z)) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, the correct interpretation of the given constraints is:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,y)): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let me rethink the whole problem. Actually, I'm going to look at the problem statement again:

The definitions from the problem statement are:

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). 

This means that, in our problem:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,y)): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that both x and z are parts of y and both touch y's boundary, they could be related in the following ways:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y and don't touch.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch but don't have any interior parts in common.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

Hmm, let me go back to re-read the whole problem statement.

TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Oops, I've been interpreting this incorrectly. TPPi(y,z) is not saying that z is part of y. It's saying that y is part of z, and y touches z's boundary. That's what the "i" in TPPi stands for: it's the inverse relation.

So, the correct interpretation of the given constraints is:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,y)): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, that's not right. TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), and TPP(z,y) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

But that's not right either. TPPi stands for the inverse of TPP. So TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z). TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary. The inverse of this would be that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Ugh, I keep getting confused. Let me just rely on the problem statement. The problem statement says:

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

And from the definition of TPP:

TPP(z,y) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z. Both x and z are parts of y and both touch y's boundary.

Ok, I'm overthinking things. Let me just step back and think more carefully. I'll use the direct definitions from the problem statement.

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Both x and z are parts of y and both touch y's boundary. I think all the RCC-8 relations are possible for x and z. I'll double check this:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y and don't touch. For example, imagine y as a circle, and x and z as small disjoint segments on the boundary of y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch but don't have any interior parts in common. For example, imagine x and z as adjacent segments on the boundary of y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. For example, imagine x and z as overlapping regions within y, both touching y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z. For example, imagine z as a segment from the boundary of y to the interior, and x as a smaller segment within z, touching the boundary of y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. For example, imagine z as a larger segment from the boundary of y to the interior, and x as a small segment entirely within z and not touching z's boundary, but still touching y's boundary.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake with NTPP. If x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, and both x and z touch the boundary of y, then there's a point on the boundary of y that is in both x and z. This point is on the boundary of z, which contradicts the definition of NTPP.

Let me rethink NTPP. NTPP(x,z) means that x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and z touches y's boundary, there might be a point on y's boundary that both x and z touch. If this point is also on z's boundary, then x touches z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) false. But if this point is not on z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) can still be true.

Hmm, actually, I think NTPP(x,z) is not possible in this scenario. Here's why: if x touches y's boundary and is a part of z, and z also touches y's boundary, then the part of y's boundary that x touches must also be touched by z. This means that x touches z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) false.

Let me consider the other relations:

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x. Similar to case 4, this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to case 5, I believe this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

But I'm not 100% sure, so let me double-check some of these. I'm particularly unsure about whether NTPP and NTPPi are possible.

Let's start with NTPP(x,z). This means x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. We know that x touches y's boundary. For x to not touch z's boundary, it would mean that x only touches parts of y's boundary that are not shared with z's boundary. But since z is also a part of y and touches y's boundary, there's a possibility that x and z don't share the same part of y's boundary.

Actually, I need to be careful with how I think about boundaries. If x is a part of z and z is a part of y, then the boundary of x might touch the boundary of y through z, but it's not directly the boundary of z.

Let me create a geometric example to visualize NTPP. Imagine y as a circle, z as a crescent shape inside y, and x as a smaller shape inside z. Both x and z touch the boundary of y, but they don't touch at the same point. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z (which is different from the boundary of y), then NTPP(x,z) can be true.

Let me think about this example again. If z is a crescent shape inside y, then z's boundary includes both a part of y's boundary and an inner arc. If x touches y's boundary within the crescent, it means x also touches z's boundary, because that part of y's boundary is also part of z's boundary. 

So, for NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be fully inside z and not touch any part of z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary, and z also touches the same part of y's boundary, then x touches z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) false.

But here's a scenario: Imagine y as a filled circle. Now, consider z as a filled semicircle of y, where the diameter of the semicircle aligns with a diameter of the circle. The boundary of z consists of the semicircular arc (which is also part of the boundary of y) and the diameter (which is inside y). Now, place x as a small shape inside z such that x touches the diameter of the semicircle (which is the boundary of z) but not the semicircular arc. In this scenario, x is touching the boundary of z, but not the boundary of y, because the diameter of the semicircle is inside y. This contradicts our condition that x touches y's boundary.

Actually, I think there's a problem with my reasoning. I think I've been a bit careless with the terminology. 

TPP(x,y) means that x is a "tangential proper part" of y, which means that x is a proper part of y (x is a subset of y and x â‰  y) and x shares at least one point with the boundary of y.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): Using the definition, this is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y and don't touch.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch but don't have any interior parts in common.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z. For example, imagine z as a region within y touching y's boundary, and x as a smaller region within z, also touching y's boundary at the same point. In this case, x touches z's boundary at that point.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z but doesn't touch the boundary of z. If x touches y's boundary, and z also touches y's boundary at the same point, then x touches z's boundary at that point, making NTPP(x,z) false. However, if x touches y's boundary at a point that is not part of z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) can be true.

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself with the boundaries. Let me try to simplify the reasoning.

If x is a proper part of z, then there are two possibilities: either x touches the boundary of z (TPP) or it doesn't (NTPP). If x touches y's boundary and z also touches y's boundary at the same point, then that point is on the boundary of both y and z. If x also touches that point, then x touches the boundary of z, making it a tangential proper part of z (TPP).

But what if x touches y's boundary at a point that is not part of z's boundary? Is this possible?

Let's think about the boundaries more carefully. If z is a proper part of y, then the boundary of z can be divided into two parts: the part that coincides with the boundary of y, and the part that is inside y. If x touches y's boundary at a point that is not part of z's boundary, it means x touches a part of y's boundary that z doesn't. But since x is a proper part of z (for NTPP to be considered), x must be entirely inside z, which means x can only touch parts of y's boundary that z also touches. This makes NTPP(x,z) impossible in this context.

Wait, let me think about this again. I've been assuming that for NTPP(x,z) to be considered, x must be a proper part of z. But that's the definition of NTPP. I should be checking if NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship given the constraints, not assuming it.

Actually, let me take a step back. The problem is: what possible RCC-8 relationships can x have with z, given that TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z)? I'll go through each RCC-8 relation and check if it can hold, based on the definitions of TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

But wait, I think I've been misinterpreting TPPi(y,z). Let's go back to the definition:

TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

But wait, if TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), then TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), not TPP(y,z). And TPP(z,y) means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. So my interpretation is correct.

So, we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's see which RCC-8 relationships are possible for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y and don't touch.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch but don't have any interior parts in common.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z. For example, imagine z as a region within y touching y's boundary, and x as a smaller region within z, also touching y's boundary at the same point. In this case, x touches z's boundary at that point.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained within z but doesn't touch the boundary of z. As I reasoned above, if x touches y's boundary and is a proper part of z, and z also touches y's boundary, then x touches z's boundary at that point, making NTPP(x,z) false.

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. By similar reasoning to point 5, if z touches y's boundary and is a proper part of x, and x also touches y's boundary, then z touches x's boundary at that point, making NTPPi(x,z) false.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Actually, I'm still not 100% sure about NTPP and NTPPi. Let me double-check.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must not touch the boundary of z. We know that x touches the boundary of y. If x is a proper part of z, then x can only touch parts of y's boundary that z also touches. But if x touches the boundary of y at a point that z also touches, then x touches the boundary of z at that point, making NTPP(x,z) false.

But wait, is it possible for x to touch the boundary of y at a point that z doesn't touch? If z is a proper part of y, and x is a proper part of z, then x is also a proper part of y. For x to touch the boundary of y, it must be through z. And if x touches the boundary of y through z, then x touches the boundary of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x and must not touch the boundary of x. By similar reasoning, if z touches the boundary of y, and x also touches the boundary of y (possibly at the same point), then z touches the boundary of x at that point, making NTPPi(x,z) false.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Actually, I've been thinking, and I'm not 100% sure on 4 either. Let me double check.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z. Given that both x and z are proper parts of y and both touch y's boundary, it's not immediately clear if x can be a proper part of z.

Actually, if you think of y as a circle, then both z and x could be smaller shapes inside y that touch the boundary of y. It's possible for x to be completely contained within z, making x a proper part of z. And if x touches the boundary of y at a point that z also touches, then x touches the boundary of z at that point, making TPP(x,z) true.

Wait, I think there's something subtle here. If both x and z touch the boundary of y, but at different points, and x is completely contained within z, then x would touch the boundary of z (because it's touching the boundary of y through z), but not at the same point where z touches the boundary of y. This would still make TPP(x,z) true.

Actually, let me reconsider this. The definition of a "tangential proper part" in RCC-8 is that the object (x) shares at least one point with the boundary of the other object (z). If x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of y, and z also touches the boundary of y, does that mean x touches the boundary of z?

Let's think about it this way: If x touches the boundary of y, and z contains x, then x must touch the boundary of z. But no, that doesn't necessarily follow. Imagine z as a non-regular shape inside y. It touches the boundary of y at some point. Now, imagine x as a smaller shape inside z. It's entirely possible for x to touch the boundary of y at a point inside z without touching the boundary of z.

Actually, I think I was wrong before. Let's simplify: If x touches the boundary of y at a point, say, point p, and x is a proper part of z, then is point p also on the boundary of z?

Let's define the boundaries more clearly. The boundary of y consists of all points in y that have points not in y in their neighborhood. If z is a proper part of y, the boundary of z consists of all points in z that have points not in z in their neighborhood.

Now, if x touches the boundary of y at point p, then p is a point in y that has points not in y in its neighborhood. If x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of y, then point p is a point in z. But is it on the boundary of z?

If point p has points not in z in its neighborhood, then it's on the boundary of z. There are two types of points not in z: points in y but not in z, and points not in y. Since p is on the boundary of y, there are points in its neighborhood that are not in y. These are also not in z, so p is on the boundary of z. Therefore, if x touches the boundary of y and is a proper part of z, then x touches the boundary of z, making TPP(x,z) true.

But actually I think I'm overthinking, and making things way more complicated than they need to be. Let me take a step back and just think about what the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) mean.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, both x and z are proper parts of y, and both touch y's boundary.

If you think of y as a circle, then both x and z could be smaller shapes inside y that touch the boundary of y. They could be completely separate (DC), touch but not overlap (EC), partially overlap (PO), one could be a part of the other (TPP or TPPi), or they could be the same (EQ).

The only reason I have concerns about NTPP and NTPPi is because I've been reasoning that if both x and z touch the boundary of y, and one is a proper part of the other, then the smaller one must touch the boundary of the larger one, making NTPP and NTPPi impossible. But I'm not 100% sure of this reasoning.

Actually, wait. If x is a proper part of z (for NTPP to be considered), then x is entirely within z. And if x touches the boundary of y, then z also touches the boundary of y at that point (because x is within z). This means that if x touches the boundary of y, it is also touching the boundary of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually wait, I think I'm just making things way more complicated. Let me take a step back and think geometrically. If x touches the boundary of y and is a proper part of z, does x necessarily touch the boundary of z?

Imagine y as a circle, z as a pizza slice of y (like a sector, so it touches the center of the circle and a portion of the boundary), and x as a small circle inside z that touches the boundary of y. In this scenario, x touches the boundary of y and is a proper part of z. x also touches the boundary of z, because the boundary of z includes the portion of the boundary of y it touches. So, in this case, TPP(x,z) is true.

Now, can we have a scenario where x touches the boundary of y, is a proper part of z, but doesn't touch the boundary of z? I don't think so. The boundary of z includes the portion of the boundary of y it touches. If x touches the boundary of y and is within z, it must touch the boundary of z.

Actually now I'm overthinking again. Let me think about a specific example. 

Imagine y as a circle. Let z be a sector of y, like a pizza slice, that touches both the center of the circle and a portion of the boundary. Now, let x be a small circle inside z that touches the boundary of y. Clearly, x is a proper part of z. But does x touch the boundary of z?

The boundary of z consists of the arc (which is part of the boundary of y) and the two radii (which are inside y). If x touches the boundary of y at a point on the arc, then x is touching the boundary of z at that point.

So, in this scenario, TPP(x,z) is true, because x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

But here's a subtle point: what if x touches the boundary of y at a point that is not on the arc of z? Can x be entirely within z and touch the boundary of y at a point outside the arc of z?

Actually, it's not possible. If x is entirely within z, and z is a sector of y, the only part of the boundary of y that x can touch is the arc of z. This is because the rest of the boundary of y is outside of z, and if x touches it, then x is not entirely within z.

So, if x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of y, then x touches the boundary of z at that point, making TPP(x,z) true.

I'm double-checking now, and it seems that NTPP(x,z) is not possible given the constraints. If x touches the boundary of y and is a proper part of z, then x touches the boundary of z, making NTPP(x,z) false.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible. If z touches the boundary of y and is a proper part of x, then z touches the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) false.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

OK, actually, I think I'm overthinking this. I was correct in my reasoning. I'll summarize the possible relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

The RCC-8 relations that are not possible are:
7. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
8. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So there are 6 possible relationships between x and z.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what possible RCC-8 spatial relationships can hold between x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me understand what these given relations mean:
- TPP(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary

So both x and z are parts of y, and both touch y's boundary.

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y that don't overlap or touch.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. TPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

6. EQ(x,z): This is possible if x and z are the same region.

7. NTPP(x,z): This is NOT possible. If x touches y's boundary and is contained within z, then x must also touch z's boundary at that point where it touches y's boundary.

8. NTPPi(x,z): This is NOT possible for similar reasons as above.
