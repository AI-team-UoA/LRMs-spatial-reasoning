PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

So we have:
- x touches y at the boundary
- y is disconnected from z

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): It's possible that x and z are disconnected. This would be the case if x and y touch at a boundary, but both x and z are separate from each other.

2. EC(x,z): It's possible that x and z touch at a boundary. Since y is disconnected from z, this would mean that x extends in a way that it touches z directly, without going through y.

3. PO(x,z): It's possible that x and z partially overlap. Since EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), this would mean that a part of x overlaps with z, but this part is not shared with y.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary, but y is completely disconnected from z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is contained entirely within z without touching z's boundary, and y is completely disconnected from z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary, but y is completely disconnected from z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained entirely within x without touching x's boundary, and y is completely disconnected from z.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are coincident. This seems unlikely, because if x and z are the same, and EC(x,y), then it should imply EC(z,y), but we know DC(y,z).

Let me re-examine EQ(x,z). If x and z are the same, then EC(x,y) would imply EC(z,y). But we know DC(y,z), which contradicts EC(z,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let's think more carefully about each of the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and y touching at a boundary, and z being disconnected from both.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. Imagine x and y touching at a boundary, and x extending to also touch z at a boundary, but y and z being disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible too. Imagine x and y touching at a boundary, and x extending to partially overlap with z, but y and z being disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): Let's think about this more. If x is a tangential proper part of z, that means x is entirely contained within z, but touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y would touch x at a boundary. But if x is entirely within z and y touches x, y would have to at least touch z too. But we know DC(y,z), which means y and z are disconnected. So TPP(x,z) seems contradictory.

Actually, let me reconsider. It is possible for TPP(x,z) to hold if x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. The part of x that touches z's boundary could be exactly the same part that touches y. So y touches x at the boundary, which is also the boundary of z, but y doesn't enter into z at all, so y and z remain disconnected.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary. But then how would y touch x? If y touches x, and x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary, then y would have to enter z, meaning y and z would not be disconnected. So NTPP(x,z) seems contradictory.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This can be consistent if the part of x's boundary that y touches is different from the part that z touches.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This can be consistent if the part of x's boundary that y touches is different from any part of z.

8. EQ(x,z): As we determined, this is not possible because it would lead to a contradiction with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check TPP(x,z) again. If x is a tangential proper part of z, that means x is entirely contained within z but touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary. But if x is entirely within z and y touches x, y would have to at least touch z too, unless the part of x that touches y is exactly the same part that touches z's boundary. In that case, y would touch x at a point that is also on z's boundary, but y would not enter into z, so y and z would remain disconnected.

In the above case, y can touch the common boundary point of x and z, and still be disconnected from z. So I think TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, I need to think a bit more clearly about this. If TPP(x,z), that means x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then y touches x at the boundary but does not share any interior parts with x. If DC(y,z), then y and z are disconnected.

The issue is, if y touches x at the boundary, and x touches z at the boundary (because x is a tangential proper part of z), then how can y and z be disconnected? Let's think about it in terms of points. If point p is on the boundary of both x and z, and y touches x at point p, then y also touches z at point p, which would make EC(y,z) true, not DC(y,z).

The only way I can see this working is if the set of points where x touches z's boundary is completely disjoint from the set of points where y touches x's boundary. But that seems to imply that x has a "free" boundary that's not part of z's boundary, which contradicts TPP(x,z).

Actually, I think the issue is that I'm thinking about these relations in terms of interiors and boundaries, but the definitions given are in terms of spatial parts. Let me revisit the definitions:

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So for TPP(x,z), x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. For DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

I think the confusion arises from thinking about "touching" in terms of topological boundaries. In the context of these spatial relations, "touching" might have a more specific meaning. For TPP(x,z), x is part of z and shares a boundary with z. For EC(x,y), x and y share a boundary point but no interior points.

But if x and y share a boundary point, and x and z share a boundary point (because x is a tangential proper part of z), does that necessarily mean y and z share a boundary point? I think the answer is no, because the boundary of x can have multiple disconnected parts, and x could share one part with y and another part with z.

Actually, let me try to draw some concrete examples to clarify:

Imagine x is a circle that is entirely contained within a larger circle z, and x touches the boundary of z at a single point. Now imagine y is a circle that is entirely outside of z, and y touches x at a different point on x's boundary. In this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), x and y are externally connected (EC(x,y)), and y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)). So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I misunderstood the TPP relation. If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. The issue I was having is that if y touches x at the boundary, and x touches z at the boundary, how can y and z be disconnected?

The key is to understand that "touching at the boundary" doesn't mean sharing all boundary points. When we say TPP(x,z), it means x is contained in z and shares some boundary points with z. Similarly, EC(x,y) means x and y share some boundary points. These shared boundary points can be different.

For example, imagine x as a circle that is entirely contained within a larger circle z, and x touches the boundary of z at a single point p. Now imagine y is a circle that is entirely outside of z, and y touches x at a different point q on x's boundary. In this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), x and y are externally connected (EC(x,y)), and y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)).

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me clarify:

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
For EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
For DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

For TPP(x,z) to be compatible with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), we need a scenario where y touches x at a boundary, but y doesn't touch or overlap with z. This is possible if x touches z's boundary at a point that is different from where x touches y's boundary.

So I think TPP(x,z) is indeed possible. 

Let's now consider NTPP(x,z). This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is contained entirely within z without touching z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then y touches x at a boundary. But if x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x, then y would have to penetrate into z, which would mean y and z are not disconnected. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me think of a concrete example. Imagine z as a circle, and x as a smaller circle entirely contained within z, but not touching z's boundary. Now, if y is a shape that touches x at the boundary, y would have to extend into z, which would mean y and z share some spatial parts, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's consider TPPi(x,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This is consistent if the part of x's boundary that y touches is different from the part that z touches.

Let's consider NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained entirely within x without touching x's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This is consistent if the part of x's boundary that y touches is different from any part of z.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z) again. If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is contained entirely within z without touching z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then y touches x at a boundary but does not share any interior parts. But if x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x, then y would have to extend into z.

Actually, maybe y could just touch x at x's boundary without extending into x or z? Let me draw this out:

Imagine z as a circle, and x as a smaller circle entirely contained within z, but not touching z's boundary. Now, imagine y as a point that is exactly on the boundary of x. In this scenario, y touches x at the boundary (EC(x,y)), and y is within z, but doesn't overlap with z because y is just a point.

No, that's not right. If y is a point on the boundary of x, and x is entirely contained within z, then y is also a point within z, which means y and z share a spatial part, contradicting DC(y,z).

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) one more time. If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then y touches x at a boundary but does not share any interior parts. If DC(y,z), then y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

The issue I'm having is reconciling these three statements. If y touches x at a boundary, and x touches z at a boundary (because x is a tangential proper part of z), then how can y and z be disconnected? Let's think about it in terms of points. If point p is on the boundary of both x and z, and y touches x at point p, then y also touches z at point p, which would make EC(y,z) true, not DC(y,z).

But what if y touches x at a point q that is on the boundary of x but not on the boundary of z? But that's not possible if TPP(x,z), because every point on the boundary of x is either on the boundary of z or in the interior of z.

Actually, I'm confusing myself again. If TPP(x,z), it doesn't mean every point on the boundary of x is on the boundary of z. It means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, i.e., there is at least one point on the boundary of x that is also on the boundary of z.

OK let's do this more carefully, being more specific about regions and their boundaries. Let's denote the interior of a region x as int(x) and the boundary of a region x as boundary(x).

For TPP(x,z), we have:
1. int(x) is a subset of int(z).
2. boundary(x) intersects boundary(z).

For EC(x,y), we have:
1. int(x) and int(y) are disjoint.
2. boundary(x) intersects boundary(y).

For DC(y,z), we have:
1. int(y) and int(z) are disjoint.
2. boundary(y) and boundary(z) are disjoint.

Given these, can TPP(x,z), EC(x,y), and DC(y,z) all be true simultaneously? Let's see.

From TPP(x,z), we know int(x) is a subset of int(z), and boundary(x) intersects boundary(z). Let's call the intersection of boundary(x) and boundary(z) as region A.

From EC(x,y), we know int(x) and int(y) are disjoint, and boundary(x) intersects boundary(y). Let's call the intersection of boundary(x) and boundary(y) as region B.

From DC(y,z), we know int(y) and int(z) are disjoint, and boundary(y) and boundary(z) are disjoint.

The question is, can regions A and B be disjoint? If A and B are disjoint, then the part of boundary(x) that intersects boundary(z) is different from the part that intersects boundary(y). But can such a configuration exist?

Actually, the problem is, if y touches x at a boundary, and that boundary is also the boundary of z, then y touches z, contradicting DC(y,z). If y touches x at a boundary that is not the boundary of z, then that boundary is in the interior of z, which means y enters the interior of z, also contradicting DC(y,z).

Let me try yet again. If TPP(x,z), then every part of x is a part of z. But this doesn't mean every boundary point of x is a boundary point of z. Some boundary points of x might be in the interior of z.

But if y touches x at a boundary point that is in the interior of z, then y enters the interior of z, contradicting DC(y,z). And if y touches x at a boundary point that is also a boundary point of z, then y touches z, also contradicting DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, just to be super-clear, let me draw out some concrete examples:

Imagine z as a circle, and x as a smaller circle that's entirely contained within z but touches z's boundary at a single point. Now, if y is a shape that touches x at a boundary point, there are two possibilities:
1. y touches x at the same point where x touches z. In this case, y would also touch z, contradicting DC(y,z).
2. y touches x at a different boundary point, which is in the interior of z. In this case, y would enter the interior of z, also contradicting DC(y,z).

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's now consider PO(x,z). This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This is possible if the part of x's boundary that y touches is not part of z.

Let me again try a concrete example. Imagine x and z as two circles that partially overlap. Now imagine y as a shape that touches x at a boundary point, but this boundary point is not part of z. In this scenario, PO(x,z), EC(x,y), and DC(y,z) are all satisfied.

So PO(x,z) is possible.

Let me re-examine TPPi(x,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This is consistent if the part of x's boundary that y touches is different from the part that z touches.

Concrete example: imagine x as a circle, and z as a smaller circle that's entirely contained within x but touches x's boundary at a single point. Now imagine y as a shape that touches x at a different boundary point. In this scenario, TPPi(x,z), EC(x,y), and DC(y,z) are all satisfied.

Let's now examine NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained entirely within x without touching x's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at a boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This is consistent if the part of x's boundary that y touches is different from any part of z.

Concrete example: imagine x as a circle, and z as a smaller circle that's entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Now imagine y as a shape that touches x at a boundary point. In this scenario, NTPPi(x,z), EC(x,y), and DC(y,z) are all satisfied.

So we have: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check TPP(x,z) again, since I'm getting confused about it.

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, which means:
1. Every part of x is a part of z.
2. x shares at least one boundary point with z.

If EC(x,y), then x and y share at least one boundary point but no interior parts.

If DC(y,z), then y and z do not share any parts, including boundary points.

Now, if y touches x at a boundary point p, there are two possibilities:
1. p is also a boundary point of z. In this case, y would touch z at p, contradicting DC(y,z).
2. p is not a boundary point of z, which means p is in the interior of z. In this case, y would enter the interior of z, also contradicting DC(y,z).

So TPP(x,z) is not possible. Let me double check NTPP(x,z) again.

If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means:
1. Every part of x is a part of z.
2. x does not share any boundary points with z.

If EC(x,y), then x and y share at least one boundary point but no interior parts.

If DC(y,z), then y and z do not share any parts, including boundary points.

Now, if y touches x at a boundary point p, p would be in the interior of z. This means y enters the interior of z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So we have: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I think the confusion I'm having is due to thinking about boundary points that are part of multiple regions. In TPP(x,z), if x is a tangential proper part of z, and p is a boundary point that's part of both x and z, is p part of the region x, the region z, or both? I think p is part of both x and z. So if y shares p with x, y also shares p with z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

OK, one more time. Let's recall the definitions:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x).
EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Now, given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), let's figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and y touch at a boundary, and both x and z are separate from each other.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. This is possible if x extends to touch z directly, without going through y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if a part of x overlaps with z, but this part is not shared with y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Let's see if this is compatible with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). If x is part of z, and y touches x at a boundary, then y would either touch z at a boundary (if the point where y touches x is also on the boundary of z) or enter the interior of z (if the point where y touches x is in the interior of z). Either way, y and z would not be disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. If y touches x at a boundary, and x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then y would enter the interior of z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary at a point that's different from where y touches x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x, and y touches x at a boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible because if x and z are the same, and EC(x,y), then EC(z,y), which contradicts DC(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check these once more just to be sure:

DC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and y touching at a boundary, and z being disconnected from both.

EC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and y touching at a boundary, and x extending to also touch z at a boundary, but y and z being disconnected.

PO(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and y touching at a boundary, and x extending to partially overlap with z, but y and z being disconnected.

TPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely contained within z, and touches z's boundary. If y touches x at a boundary, it would have to touch or enter z, contradicting DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary. If y touches x at a boundary, it would have to enter z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained within x, and touches x's boundary. This is possible if the point where z touches x's boundary is different from where y touches x's boundary.

NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary. This is possible if y touches x at a boundary.

EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. If x and y touch at a boundary, then z and y would also touch at a boundary, contradicting DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

These are the 5 possible relationships:
DC(x,z): Disconnected
EC(x,z): Externally Connected
PO(x,z): Partially Overlapping
TPPi(x,z): Tangential Proper Part Inverse
NTPPi(x,z): Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at a boundary while both x and z are completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at one boundary point and touch z at a different boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z while still touching y at a boundary point that's not shared with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is inside z touching z's boundary, and y touches x, then y would have to either touch or intersect z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x, then y would have to enter z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x touching x's boundary at a point different from where y touches x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then EC(x,y) would mean EC(z,y), contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
