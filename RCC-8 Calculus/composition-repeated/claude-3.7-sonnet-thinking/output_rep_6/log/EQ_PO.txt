PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze this problem, considering what we know:

1. EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
2. PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Given these two relations, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that y has with z, x will have the same relationship with z.

Given that PO(y,z), and x is equivalent to y, then x must also partially overlap z. So:

PO(x,z) must be true.

Let me double-check this by considering each relation:

- DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), x can't be disconnected from z because y overlaps with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

- EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), x must share interior parts with z because y does. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

- PO(x,z): Since x is equivalent to y, and y partially overlaps z, x must also partially overlap z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

- TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), x can't be wholly contained in z because y isn't. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But again, since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), x can't be wholly contained in z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

- TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), z can't be wholly contained in x because z isn't wholly contained in y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But again, since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), z can't be wholly contained in x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), x can't be equivalent to z because y isn't. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me check my work by thinking about this from a different angle. 

EQ(x,y) means x and y are exactly the same region. So anything we know about y's relationship with z must also be true for x's relationship with z.

Given PO(y,z), we know that y and z partially overlap - they share some interior parts but neither is wholly contained in the other.

Since x is the same region as y (due to EQ(x,y)), x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way that y does.

Therefore, PO(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me reconsider.

We know:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical regions
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some part, but neither is contained in the other)

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), whatever relationship y has with z, x must have the same relationship with z.

Given that y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), and x is identical to y, then x must also partially overlap with z.

Therefore, PO(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

Let me reason through this more carefully by considering the definitions:

1. EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy exactly the same space.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

If x and y occupy exactly the same space (EQ(x,y)), then any part of y is also a part of x, and vice versa. 

Since y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), y shares some spatial part with z. And since x is identical to y, x must also share that same spatial part with z.

Furthermore, since PO(y,z) means neither y nor z is fully contained in the other, and x is identical to y, then neither x nor z can be fully contained in the other.

Therefore, x and z must have a partial overlap relationship: PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine how x relates to z, given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (identical regions)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some interior parts, but neither contains the other)

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical spatial regions, x must have exactly the same relationship with z that y has with z.

Given that y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), and x is identical to y, then x must also partially overlap with z in the same way.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
