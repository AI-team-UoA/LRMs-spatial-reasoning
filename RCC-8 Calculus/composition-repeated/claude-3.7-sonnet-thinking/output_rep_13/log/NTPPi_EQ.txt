PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's understand what we know:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are spatially equivalent, or coincident.

Given these two facts, we need to figure out what the possible relationships between x and z are.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are the same spatial region. Since NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z must also be completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So the relationship between x and z is the same as the relationship between x and y.

Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,y), it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check. NTPPi(x,y) means that NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. And EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same spatial region.

So, we have:
- NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same spatial region

From these, we can infer:
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z)

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be more precise. NTPPi(x,y) means that x contains y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same spatial region. So if y is contained in x without touching the boundary of x, and y and z are the same, then z is also contained in x without touching the boundary of x. 

So the relationship between x and z is indeed NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I just want to be extra sure I'm getting the definitions right. Let me re-examine the definitions of the relations:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region.

Now, let's apply these definitions to our problem:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
2. EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same spatial region.

Given these, z must also be part of x but not touching x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or, equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just make 100% sure, by going through a logical deduction.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x without touching x's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same spatial region

From EQ(y,z), we can infer that any relation that holds between y and another region also holds between z and that region. In other words, if y has a certain spatial relationship with x, then z has the same relationship with x.

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is inside x without touching x's boundary. Since y and z are the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), z is also inside x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to understand what each relation means and how they combine.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(y,x))
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (they are the same spatial region)

If y is a non-tangential proper part of x (completely inside x without touching x's boundary), and z is equivalent to y (same spatial region), then z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Since y and z are the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), any spatial relation that holds between y and another region must also hold between z and that region.

Therefore, z has the same relationship with x as y does with x.
