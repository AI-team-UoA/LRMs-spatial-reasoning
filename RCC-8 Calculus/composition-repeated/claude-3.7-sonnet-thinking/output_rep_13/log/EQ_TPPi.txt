PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this carefully. We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means that z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y))

So z is a tangential proper part of y, and y is equivalent to x. 

Let's analyze what TPP(z,y) means:
- z is a proper part of y (z is fully contained within y)
- z touches y's boundary (there is at least one point where z touches the boundary of y)

Now we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy exactly the same space, which means:
- x has the same boundary as y
- x has the same interior as y

Since TPP(z,y), z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given that x and y are equivalent, z must also be fully contained within x and touch x's boundary. This corresponds to the relation TPP(z,x).

But remember that we need to describe the relationship between x and z, not z and x. So we need the inverse relation of TPP(z,x), which is TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- If z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), and x is equivalent to y (EQ(x,y)), then z must also be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)).
- From the perspective of the relationship between x and z, this is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I need to make sure I'm getting the direction correct. Let me verify:

- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y.
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same.

So if z is a tangential proper part of y, and y is the same as x, then z must be a tangential proper part of x. This means TPP(z,x), or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Wait, actually, I need to be more careful here. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. But I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let's start again:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., TPP(z,y). This means:
- z is fully contained within y
- z touches the boundary of y

Since x is equivalent to y (EQ(x,y)), x and y occupy the same space. Therefore:
- z is fully contained within x
- z touches the boundary of x

This corresponds to the relation TPP(z,x), or from the perspective of the relationship between x and z, TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

OK let me be very careful with the definitions again:

- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are exactly the same region)
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP, so it means TPP(z,y)
- TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:
- Since EQ(x,y), x and y are exactly the same region
- Since TPPi(y,z), z is a tangential proper part of y
- Given that x and y are the same, z must also be a tangential proper part of x
- Therefore, TPP(z,x) holds, which from the perspective of the relationship between x and z, is TPPi(x,z)

Wait, I'm getting confused with the notation. Let me be extremely careful:

- TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z
- This is equivalent to saying TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y

So the correct interpretation is:
- TPPi(y,z) means that y is contained within z and touches z's boundary
- z contains y, and y touches z's boundary

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:
- Since EQ(x,y), x and y are exactly the same region
- Since TPPi(y,z), y is contained within z and touches z's boundary
- Given that x and y are the same, x must also be contained within z and touch z's boundary
- Therefore, TPP(x,z) holds

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

OK, I'm still feeling confused, so let me define everything from scratch again. 

In the RCC-8 calculus:
- TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b, i.e., a is fully contained within b and touches b's boundary
- TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b), so it means TPP(b,a), which is: b is fully contained within a and touches a's boundary
- EQ(a,b) means that a and b are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space

Now, we have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident
- TPPi(y,z): y is the inverse tangential proper part of z, which means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary

Since x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space), and z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary, it follows that z is also fully contained within x and touches x's boundary. This corresponds to TPP(z,x).

From the perspective of the relationship between x and z, this is TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm still getting confused. Let me go one by one and just think about the regions.

EQ(x,y) means x and y are exactly the same region.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. This means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., TPP(z,y).

TPP(z,y) means:
- z is properly contained within y (i.e., z is a subset of y but not equal to y)
- z touches the boundary of y

Now, since x is exactly the same region as y (due to EQ(x,y)), and z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary, it follows that z is also properly contained within x and touches x's boundary. This corresponds to TPP(z,x).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z from the perspective of x is TPPi(x,z).

Let me go though one last time. TPPi(y,z) means that the region y is a Tangential Proper Part Inverse of z. That means, z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary (TPP(z,y)). 

So z is a proper part of y, and y is the same as x (EQ(x,y)). Therefore, z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, which means TPP(z,x).

So the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just realized that I've been making a mistake in understanding TPPi(y,z). Let me make sure I get the definition right:

- TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b, i.e., a is properly contained within b and touches b's boundary
- TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b), so it means TPP(b,a), which is: b is properly contained within a and touches a's boundary

So, TPPi(y,z) means that z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary (TPP(z,y)).

Let's proceed:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are exactly the same region)
- TPPi(y,z): z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary

Since x and y are the same region, and z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary, it follows that z is also properly contained within x and touches x's boundary. This corresponds to TPP(z,x).

From the perspective of the relationship between x and z, this is TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm still getting confused with the notation. Let me try a completely different approach. 

Let's think of these regions as sets, and let's consider the relationships:

- EQ(x,y) means x = y (they are the same set)
- TPP(a,b) means a is a proper subset of b (a ⊂ b, not a = b) and a touches the boundary of b
- TPPi(a,b) means b is a proper subset of a (b ⊂ a, not b = a) and b touches the boundary of a, which is the same as TPP(b,a)

Now, we have:
- EQ(x,y): x = y
- TPPi(y,z): y is a proper superset of z (z ⊂ y, not z = y) and z touches the boundary of y

Since x = y (due to EQ(x,y)), and y is a proper superset of z, it follows that x is also a proper superset of z. Also, since z touches the boundary of y, and y = x, z must also touch the boundary of x. This corresponds to TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Oh wait, I may have been getting tripped up by the order of arguments.

TPPi(y,z) means y is contained in z with them sharing a boundary point (i.e., TPP(y,z) with the arguments swapped). But you know what, now I've confused myself again. Let's just go back to the definition.

- TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b
- TPPi(a,b) is the inverse of TPP(a,b), which means TPP(b,a), i.e., b is a tangential proper part of a

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which is: z is a tangential proper part of y.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y

Since x and y are coincident, and z is a tangential proper part of y, it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x. This corresponds to TPP(z,x), or from the perspective of the relationship between x and z, TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

I think I've been overthinking this. Let's simplify:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z that touches z's boundary

We need to find the relationship between x and z.

Since x is the same as y (due to EQ(x,y)), and y is a tangential proper part of z, it follows that x is also a tangential proper part of z. This corresponds to TPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

OK I want to double-check this by looking at the original definitions of the relationships.

Alright, in RCC-8, the spatial relations are defined as follows:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is the inverse of TPP, so TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is the inverse of NTPP, so NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

We are given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, they occupy exactly the same space.
- TPPi(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary. Alternatively, z properly contains y and they share a boundary point.

Now, since x and y are the same region, and y is part of z and touches z's boundary, it follows that x is also part of z and touches z's boundary. This corresponds to TPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Ah, I was getting confused because I kept switching the arguments. Here's the correct analysis:

- TPP(a,b) means a is a proper part of b and they share a boundary point.
- TPPi(a,b) means b is a proper part of a and they share a boundary point. This is the inverse of TPP, so TPPi(a,b) is equivalent to TPP(b,a).

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which is: z is a proper part of y and they share a boundary point.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and they share a boundary point

Since x and y are coincident, and z is a proper part of y and they share a boundary point, it follows that z is also a proper part of x and they share a boundary point. This corresponds to TPP(z,x), or from the perspective of the relationship between x and z, TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Umm... I'm actually not convinced that I'm right. Let me double-check the definitions yet again to make sure I understand them correctly.

In RCC-8, the relations are:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but their interiors are disjoint).
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is a proper part of y and x does not touch the boundary of y).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Now, we have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (this is the same as TPP(z,y)).

Since x is equal to y, and z is a tangential proper part of y, it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x, which is TPP(z,x), or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I was right originally. Let me understand the situation using a different approach.

In RCC-8, "TPP" stands for "Tangential Proper Part". If TPP(x,y), then x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, TPPi is the inverse of TPP. So, TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which is: y is a tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Since x is equal to y (from EQ(x,y)), and y is a tangential proper part of z (from TPPi(y,z)), it follows that x is also a tangential proper part of z. This corresponds to TPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

I'm still doubting myself, so let me triple-check this.

If TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. Since x is equal to y (EQ(x,y)), it follows that x is also fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. This corresponds to TPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Let's confirm this with a visual example:
- Imagine z as a large circle.
- Imagine y as a smaller circle fully contained within z, with its boundary touching z's boundary at a single point.
- Since EQ(x,y), x is the same as y, so x is also a smaller circle fully contained within z, with its boundary touching z's boundary at a single point.
- This relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

I'm now confident that the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Let me do one last check to make sure I've got the notation right:

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y (x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary).
- TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), so it means TPP(y,x), which is: y is a tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. Wait, that's not right. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

OK this is confusing me again. Let's look at the definition from the beginning:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary).
- TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means the relation goes in the opposite direction. So, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary). This is the same as TPP(y,x).

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary).

Since x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), and z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary (TPPi(y,z)), it follows that z is also properly contained within x and touches x's boundary. This corresponds to TPP(z,x) or, from the perspective of the relationship between x and z, TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

OK I've now convinced myself that the correct answer is TPPi(x,z). Let me make sure by going over it one more time.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., TPP(z,y)).

Since x and y are the same region, and z is a tangential proper part of y, it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x. This corresponds to TPP(z,x), or from the perspective of the relationship between x and z, TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

To confirm, I can check if this is consistent with the properties of the RCC-8 calculus. Specifically, I can use the following:
- If EQ(x,y) and R(y,z), then R(x,z) for any RCC-8 relation R.
- This means if y has a certain relationship with z, and x is the same as y, then x has the same relationship with z.

In our case, TPPi(y,z) is the relationship between y and z. Since x is the same as y (EQ(x,y)), it follows that x has the same relationship with z as y does, which is TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the implications of the given relations:

1. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.
2. TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP, which means z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)). In other words, z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Since x and y are coincident (they are exactly the same region), and z is a tangential proper part of y, it follows that z must also be a tangential proper part of x. 

Therefore, TPP(z,x) holds, which from the perspective of the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
