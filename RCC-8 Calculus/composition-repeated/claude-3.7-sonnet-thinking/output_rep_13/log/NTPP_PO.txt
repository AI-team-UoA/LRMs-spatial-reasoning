PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step-by-step.

We are told that NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. In other words, x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is completely contained in y, and there is some space between x and the boundary of y.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now, I need to determine what possible relationships can hold between x and z.

Given that x is completely contained within y, and y partially overlaps with z, there are a few possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. It's possible that x is completely contained within the overlapping region of y and z. In this case, x would be a part of z, and since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it likely doesn't touch z's boundary either. So NTPP(x,z) would hold.

2. It's possible that x is completely outside the overlapping region of y and z, but still completely inside y. In this case, x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) would hold.

3. It's possible that x partially overlaps with the overlapping region of y and z. In this case, PO(x,z) would hold.

4. It's possible that x touches the boundary of the overlapping region of y and z from the inside. In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z) would hold.

5. It's also possible that x touches the boundary of z but doesn't overlap with z. In this case, EC(x,z) would hold.

Let me check if I'm missing any other possibilities...

Given that y and z partially overlap, and x is completely contained within y, I think these are the five possible relationships between x and z: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

However, I want to check if all of these are actually possible given the constraints.

- DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. If x is contained in y but completely outside the overlap region of y and z, then x and z are disconnected.

- EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches the boundary of the overlap region of y and z, but doesn't overlap with z.

Wait, I need to be careful here. NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some space, but not all of either.

If x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z doesn't fully contain y, then x can't touch z's boundary from outside of z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider the possibilities:

- DC(x,z): If x is inside y but doesn't overlap with z at all, then x and z are disconnected.

- PO(x,z): If x partially overlaps with the overlap region of y and z, then x and z partially overlap.

- TPP(x,z): If x is completely inside the overlap region of y and z, and touches the boundary of the overlap region from inside, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

- NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside the overlap region of y and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of the overlap region, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

I'm actually not sure if TPP(x,z) is possible, because for this to happen, x would need to touch the boundary of z while being completely inside y. Given that y and z partially overlap, it's possible that the boundary of their overlap region is also part of the boundary of z. So I think TPP(x,z) is still a possibility.

Actually, I need to reconsider this more carefully. 

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely contained within y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share some space, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Given these, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x is contained in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): For this to be possible, x would need to touch z's boundary. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z doesn't completely contain y, the only way x could touch z's boundary is if z's boundary cuts through the interior of y, and x touches this boundary. This is indeed possible, so EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x overlaps with the overlap region of y and z, but isn't completely contained in z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely contained in z, and touches z's boundary. For this to happen, z's boundary would need to cut through the interior of y, and x would need to touch this boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely contained in z, and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, which is not possible because x is completely contained in y, and y partially overlaps with z, so z can't be completely contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is not possible for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are the same region, which is not possible because z overlaps with y, but isn't completely contained in y, while x is completely contained in y.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually I'm not sure if EC(x,z) is a valid possibility. Let me think through it once more.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely contained within y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share some space, but neither is completely contained in the other.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries, but not overlap. Given that x is completely inside y, the only way x could touch z's boundary is if z's boundary cuts through the interior of y. But if x touches z's boundary, that means x and z are touching, which is more consistent with the definition of EC, not DC.

OK so here's what EC(x,z) would mean: x touches z just at the boundary of z, but doesn't overlap with z's interior. This is possible if z's boundary cuts through the interior of y, and x touches this boundary but doesn't cross over into z's interior.

So I think the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me think about EC(x,z) again...

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely contained within y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share some space, but neither is completely contained in the other.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x would need to touch z's boundary but not overlap with z's interior. If z's boundary cuts through the interior of y, and x touches this boundary, then x and z would be externally connected, which is the definition of EC.

So yes, EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to reconsider this problem from the beginning, and use pictures to help me think about it.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely contained within y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share some space, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let's imagine these regions:

y is a circle.
x is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
z is another circle that partially overlaps with y.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x is contained in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. For example, if z only overlaps with the left side of y, and x is on the right side of y, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): For this to be possible, x would need to touch z's boundary. If z's boundary cuts through the interior of y, and x touches this boundary, then x and z would be externally connected. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x overlaps with the overlap region of y and z, but isn't completely contained in z. For example, if x is partially in the overlap region of y and z, but also extends into a part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely contained in z, and touches z's boundary. If z's boundary cuts through the interior of y, and x is completely inside the overlap region of y and z, and touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely contained in z, and doesn't touch z's boundary. If the overlap region of y and z is large enough, and x is small enough and placed appropriately, then x could be completely inside the overlap region, and not touch the boundary of the overlap region. In this case, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, which is not possible because x is completely contained in y, and y partially overlaps with z, so z can't be completely contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is not possible for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are the same region, which is not possible because z overlaps with y, but isn't completely contained in y, while x is completely contained in y.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm having second thoughts about TPP(x,z). Let me think about it more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely contained in z, and touch z's boundary. But we also know that x is completely contained in y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.

If x is completely inside z, then x must be completely inside the overlap region of y and z. But if x touches z's boundary, and the overlap region of y and z is strictly contained inside both y and z, then x would also touch the boundary of the overlap region, which means x would touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

However, it's possible that the boundary of the overlap region is not always on the boundary of y. It can cut through the interior of y in some places, and in these places, x could touch the boundary of the overlap region (which is also z's boundary) without touching y's boundary.

So I think TPP(x,z) is still a valid possibility.

Actually, let me just trace this through step by step, with the exact definitions, to be sure.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, x is completely contained in y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some space, but neither is completely contained in the other. The overlap region is denoted as O = y ∩ z.

Now, let's consider the different possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is contained in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. That is, if x ∩ O = ∅.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. For this to be possible, x would need to touch z's boundary. If z's boundary cuts through the interior of y, and x touches this boundary, then x and z would be externally connected. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. They share some space, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is possible if x overlaps with the overlap region of y and z, but isn't completely contained in z. That is, if x ∩ O ≠ ∅ and x \ O ≠ ∅ and z \ x ≠ ∅.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means that x is completely contained in z, and touches z's boundary. For this to be possible, x would need to be completely contained in the overlap region of y and z, and touch z's boundary. But here's where I'm uncertain: if x touches z's boundary, and x is completely contained in y, wouldn't that mean that z's boundary intersects with the interior of y? And if so, wouldn't the overlap region's boundary be z's boundary at that point? And if x touches the overlap region's boundary, wouldn't that mean that x touches y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y)?

Actually, the overlap region's boundary is not just y's boundary or z's boundary. It's the union of parts of y's boundary, parts of z's boundary, and possibly other boundary parts where y and z intersect in their interiors. So x can touch the overlap region's boundary (which is also z's boundary at that point) without touching y's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is possible if x is completely contained in the overlap region, and touches the part of the overlap region's boundary that is also z's boundary, but not y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that x is completely contained in z, and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside the overlap region, and doesn't touch the overlap region's boundary. That is, if x ⊂ O and x doesn't touch the boundary of O.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean that z is completely contained in x, and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because x is completely contained in y, and y partially overlaps with z, so z can't be completely contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean that z is completely contained in x, and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This would mean that x = z. This is not possible because z overlaps with y, but isn't completely contained in y, while x is completely contained in y.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I'm going to double-check the TPP(x,z) case by reasoning through a specific example.

Imagine y is a circle with its center at the origin.
x is a smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary.
z is a circle that overlaps with y, but neither is contained in the other.

If the center of z is outside of y, then the boundary of z will cut through the interior of y. If x is positioned so that it touches the boundary of z at a point inside y, then x would be a tangential proper part of z, because x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

In fact, let's construct a more concrete example. Let y be the unit circle centered at the origin. Let x be the circle of radius 0.4 centered at (0, 0). Let z be the circle of radius 1 centered at (0.6, 0). The overlap region of y and z is a lens-shaped region. If we place x so that it's centered at (0, 0), then x is completely inside the overlap region, and touches the boundary of z at the point (0.4, 0). So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Just for the sake of clarity, let me verify that all of these relationships are indeed possible by constructing a specific example for each.

1. DC(x,z): Let y be the unit circle centered at the origin. Let x be the circle of radius 0.4 centered at (-0.5, 0). Let z be the circle of radius 0.5 centered at (1, 0). The overlap region of y and z is a small lens-shaped region near the point (0.5, 0). x is completely inside y, but doesn't overlap with z, so DC(x,z) holds.

2. EC(x,z): Let y be the unit circle centered at the origin. Let x be the circle of radius 0.4 centered at (-0.1, 0). Let z be the circle of radius 0.5 centered at (1, 0). The overlap region of y and z is a small lens-shaped region near the point (0.5, 0). x is completely inside y, and touches the boundary of z at the point (0.3, 0), but doesn't overlap with the interior of z, so EC(x,z) holds.

3. PO(x,z): Let y be the unit circle centered at the origin. Let x be the circle of radius 0.4 centered at (0.3, 0). Let z be the circle of radius 0.5 centered at (0.7, 0). The overlap region of y and z is a lens-shaped region around the point (0.5, 0). x is completely inside y, and partially overlaps with z, but isn't completely contained in z, so PO(x,z) holds.

4. TPP(x,z): Let y be the unit circle centered at the origin. Let x be the circle of radius 0.4 centered at (0.5, 0). Let z be the circle of radius 0.9 centered at (0.5, 0). The overlap region of y and z is a large portion of y. x is completely inside both y and z, and touches the boundary of z at the points (0.5 ± 0.4, 0), so TPP(x,z) holds.

5. NTPP(x,z): Let y be the unit circle centered at the origin. Let x be the circle of radius 0.3 centered at (0.5, 0). Let z be the circle of radius 0.9 centered at (0.5, 0). The overlap region of y and z is a large portion of y. x is completely inside both y and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

So all five relationships are indeed possible.

The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double check DC(x,z) again. 

DC(x,z) means that x and z are disconnected. For this to be possible, x would need to be completely inside a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. Since PO(y,z) means that y and z share some space, but not all of either, there is a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. If x is contained in this part, then DC(x,z) holds.

So DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

OK to conclude, the possible relations are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given that NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap but neither contains the other.

Let me analyze the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Possible if x touches z's boundary where it cuts through y's interior.

3. PO(x,z) - Partial overlap: Possible if x partially extends into the y-z overlap region.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary from inside.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

The inverse relations (TPPi, NTPPi) and EQ are impossible because x is completely within y while z extends beyond y.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
