PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's go through this step by step.

We have the following relations:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means that x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, i.e., they are the same region.

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are the same region. This means that any relationship that holds between x and y will also hold between x and z.

Given TPP(x,y), and since y and z are the same, we can infer that TPP(x,z) must hold.

Let me double-check this reasoning:

If y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then y and z have the same boundaries and the same interior. 
If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
Since z has the same boundary and interior as y, x is also a proper part of z and x touches z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z must be TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be more careful here. The definition of EQ(y,z) is that y and z are coincident, which I've been interpreting as them being the same region. Let me be more precise.

EQ(y,z) means that y is a part of z and z is a part of y. In RCC-8, this is equivalent to saying that y and z are the same region.

Given this, if x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), and y is the same as z (EQ(y,z)), then x must also be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

So, the answer is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical spatial regions, they have the same boundaries and interior. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that TPP(x,y), and y is identical to z, it follows that x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
