PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

2. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now, if we combine these two facts, we can deduce the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, it follows that x must be completely inside z. So x must be a proper part of z.

Now, the question is whether x touches the boundary of z or not. Since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (due to NTPP(x,y)), and y doesn't touch the boundary of z (due to NTPP(y,z)), it follows that x also doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

If x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then it follows that x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This confirms that NTPP(x,z) is the correct relationship.

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually, let me think about this more carefully. 

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

If x is completely inside y and y is completely inside z, then x must be completely inside z. But I need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

Since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch the boundary of y. And since NTPP(y,z), y doesn't touch the boundary of z. Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z, because if it did, y would also have to touch the boundary of z (since x is contained within y), contradicting NTPP(y,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I have been over-complicating this. Let's reason geometrically. 

If we have three regions x, y, and z, and x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x is necessarily completely inside z and not touching z's boundary. This is because the boundary of z is separated from the boundary of y by some non-zero distance, and the boundary of y is separated from the boundary of x by some non-zero distance. So, the boundary of z is separated from the boundary of x by some non-zero distance, which means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, before I submit my final answer, let me double-check once more using a different approach.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is contained within y and is not equal to y), and x does not touch the boundary of y.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is contained within z and is not equal to z), and y does not touch the boundary of z.

Given these conditions, x must be a proper part of z because x is contained within y, and y is contained within z. So x is contained within z.

Now, I need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z or not. If x touches the boundary of z, then the relationship would be TPP(x,z). If x does not touch the boundary of z, then the relationship would be NTPP(x,z).

Since NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary. And since NTPP(y,z), y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary. This means that y is separated from the boundary of z by some distance, and x is separated from the boundary of y by some distance. As a result, x is separated from the boundary of z by some distance, which means that x does not touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the final answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I just realized that I have been neglecting the fact that RCC-8 relations are exhaustive. In RCC-8, the relationship between two regions must be one of the eight basic relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), let's consider each of the eight basic relations to determine which one(s) could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But if x is part of y, and y is part of z, then x must also be part of z, so they cannot be disconnected. Hence, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected, touching only at their boundaries. Again, if x is part of y, and y is part of z, then x must be completely inside z, not just touching its boundary. Hence, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. But if x is part of y, and y is part of z, then x is completely inside z, not just partially overlapping with it. Hence, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is part of z and touches z's boundary. But if x is inside y, not touching y's boundary, and y is inside z, not touching z's boundary, then x cannot touch z's boundary. Hence, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary. Given the conditions, x is indeed part of z (through the transitivity of the "part of" relationship), and as we've established, x cannot touch z's boundary. Hence, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But if x is part of y, and y is part of z, then z cannot be part of x. Hence, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, if x is part of y, and y is part of z, then z cannot be part of x. Hence, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But if x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x cannot be equal to z. Hence, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after considering all eight basic relations, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check by using a concrete example:

Consider three concentric circles: x is the innermost circle, y is the middle circle, and z is the outermost circle. Assume that x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary).

In this scenario, NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) hold. Now, what is the relationship between x and z?

Clearly, x is strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) holds.

This concrete example confirms our abstract reasoning. Therefore, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

I think the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship must hold between x and z given that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given these conditions, I can determine that:
1. Since x is completely inside y (from NTPP(x,y))
2. And y is completely inside z (from NTPP(y,z))
3. Then x must be completely inside z

Furthermore, x cannot touch the boundary of z. Why? Because x doesn't even touch the boundary of y, and y itself doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means x is separated from z's boundary by at least two "layers" of distance.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.
