PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

Given that y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they are essentially the same spatial region. Therefore, any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since PO(x,y) holds, and y and z are equivalent, then PO(x,z) must also hold.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me double-check this reasoning.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, which means they are the same region. Another way to think about it is that EQ(y,z) means y is a part of z and z is a part of y.

If y and z are the same region, then any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Since PO(x,y) holds, it means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

Given that y and z are the same region, x and z must also share a spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Hmm, to be extra sure, let me reason about this more carefully.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they are the same region.

Since y and z are the same region, anything that overlaps with y also overlaps with z, and vice versa. Also, if something is not a part of y, it's not a part of z, and vice versa.

Given that x and y share a spatial part (due to PO(x,y)), x and z must also share a spatial part (because z is the same as y).

Given that x is not a part of y (due to PO(x,y)), x is not a part of z (because z is the same as y).

Given that y is not a part of x (due to PO(x,y)), z is not a part of x (because z is the same as y).

Therefore, x and z share a spatial part, but neither is a part of the other, which is the definition of PO. Hence, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me directly analyze the composite relationship using the definitions of RCC-8 relations:

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., y = z.

If y = z (due to EQ(y,z)), then I can substitute z for y in the PO(x,y) relation:
PO(x,y) becomes PO(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, wait - I think I've been taking an intuitive shortcut. The more careful thing would be to carefully examine the conditions for each of the possible relations between x and z, and rule out the ones that are impossible.

Alright, let's go through each of the eight relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. But we know from PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) that x and y share a spatial part, and y and z are the same, so x and z must share a spatial part. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. But from PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that x and y share interior parts, and y and z are the same, so x and z must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. From PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other, and y and z are the same. Therefore, x and z also share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. But from PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that x is not a part of y, and y and z are the same. Therefore, x is not a part of z, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. But from PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that x is not a part of y, and y and z are the same. Therefore, x is not a part of z, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. But from PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that y is not a part of x, and y and z are the same. Therefore, z is not a part of x, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. But from PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that y is not a part of x, and y and z are the same. Therefore, z is not a part of x, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. But from PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other, and y and z are the same. Therefore, x and z also share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other, which contradicts the definition of EQ. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on the above analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Wait, let me re-check this. From PO(x,y), we know x and y overlap, but neither is part of the other. From EQ(y,z), we know y and z are the same region. Since y and z are the same, x and z must have the same relationship as x and y. Thus, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Oh! I think I can explain this more directly:

Given:
PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
EQ(y,z): y and z are equivalent (the same region).

Since y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. This is because, from a spatial perspective, y and z are indistinguishable.

Therefore, since PO(x,y) holds, PO(x,z) must also hold.

So, the answer is:
PO(x,z)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze the implications of PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

First, let's understand what these relations mean:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. The regions y and z are spatially indistinguishable.

Therefore, if PO(x,y) holds, and y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), then x must have the same relationship with z as it has with y.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
