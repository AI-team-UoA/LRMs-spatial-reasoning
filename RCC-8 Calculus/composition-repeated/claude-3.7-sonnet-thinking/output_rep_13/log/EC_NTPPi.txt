PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break this down:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Given that:
- x and y touch at their boundaries (EC).
- z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y)).

The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible because z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while x only touches y's boundary from the outside. Therefore, x and z don't share any points.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This isn't possible because z doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch x, which is only in contact with y at y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is strictly outside y (except for the boundary). They can't overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because x is outside y (except for the boundary), and z is strictly inside y. So, x can't be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary). So, z can't be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary). They can't be the same region.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), meaning they are disconnected.

Wait, let me double-check this. The fact that EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. And the fact that NTPPi(y,z), which is the same as NTPP(z,y), means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Given that x only touches y's boundary from the outside, and z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, there has to be a gap between x and z. So they must be disconnected, which corresponds to DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, I need to reconsider this. If EC(x,y), it means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. If NTPPi(y,z), it means z fully contains y and y doesn't touch z's boundary (i.e., y is strictly inside z). 

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. If z fully contains y, and x touches y's boundary, then x would at least touch z (if not overlap with it). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. If z fully contains y and y touches x at the boundary, then it's possible that z also only touches x at the boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. If z fully contains y and extends beyond it, and x touches y's boundary, then it's possible that x and z overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. If z fully contains y and x only touches y's boundary, it's possible that x is also inside z but touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary and y is strictly inside z, this isn't possible. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But z fully contains y, and x only touches y's boundary from the outside. So z cannot be inside x. TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because z fully contains y, but x only touches y's boundary from the outside.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(x,z).

Wait, I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let's reconsider.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y). This means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's think of it spatially:
- y fully contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.
- x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

So, x is outside y (except for the boundary), and z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. 

The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Given that z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is outside y and only touches y's boundary, there's no way for x and z to touch or overlap. So DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This isn't possible because z doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch x, which is only in contact with y at y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary). They can't overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because x is outside y (except for the boundary), and z is strictly inside y. So, x can't be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary). So, z can't be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary). They can't be the same region.

I see that I was mistaken in my previous analysis. Given the constraints, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), meaning they are disconnected.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully.

I have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): is the same as NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Given that z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is outside y and only touches y's boundary, there's no way for x and z to touch or overlap. So DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This isn't possible because z doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch x, which is only in contact with y at y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary). They can't overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because x is outside y (except for the boundary), and z is strictly inside y. So, x can't be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary). So, z can't be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This isn't possible because z is strictly inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary). They can't be the same region.

The relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

But wait, I think I'm making a logical error. I need to be more precise with my reasoning.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let me visualize this: y is strictly inside z, and x touches y's boundary. Now, the question is, what's the relationship between x and z?

If y is strictly inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then x might also be inside z, or it might extend outside z, or it might just touch z's boundary.

The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This isn't possible. If x touches y's boundary, and y is strictly inside z, then x must at least touch z or be inside z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and extends outside z, but just touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x touches y's boundary, extends inside z, and also outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and is fully contained within z, but touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x touches y's boundary but is strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible. If y is strictly inside z, and x only touches y's boundary, then z can't be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This isn't possible. If y is strictly inside z, and x only touches y's boundary, then x and z can't be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider:

The problem says:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y). This means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

I had the direction of NTPP/NTPPi wrong. Let me recalculate.

So, y contains z, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary). X touches y's boundary. The question is, what's the relationship between x and z?

Given that z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is outside y but touches y's boundary, there's a gap between x and z. So, x and z don't touch or overlap. The only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Let me think even more carefully:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

To be crystal clear:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, y fully contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary. X touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Given that z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is outside y and only touches y's boundary, there's a gap between x and z. So, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

That's it. The relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, let me read the problem statement once more.

From the problem:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): The 'i' stands for 'inverse', so this means NTPP(z,y). This means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let me think step by step:

1. EC(x,y): x and y share a boundary point but no interior points. So, x is outside y but touches y's boundary.
2. NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y). So, z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Given that x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, there's a gap between x and z. They don't share any points. Therefore, the relationship is DC(x,z), meaning they are disconnected.

But let me double-check. The problem states:

NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's check a possible counterexample. Could x and z share a point? If they did, that point would be part of y, since z is inside y. And the point would be on y's boundary because x only touches y's boundary. But that would mean z touches y's boundary, which is a contradiction to NTPPi(y,z). So, x and z can't share a point, and they must be disconnected.

One final check: let's see if I'm being consistent with the definition of EC(x,y). If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. So x is outside y (except for the boundary, which they share).

And if NTPPi(y,z), then z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So z is in the interior of y.

Given these two constraints, x and z don't share any points. The relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, in the definition it is stated that NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). I've been reading that correctly.

So if NTPP(z,y), it means z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

And if EC(x,y), it means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

So x is outside y (except for the boundary), and z is strictly inside y. There's a gap between x and z, so they're disconnected: DC(x,z).

That's the answer.

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement carefully to make sure I understand the definition of NTPPi correctly.

According to the problem statement:
"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)"

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y).

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, y contains z, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary).

And EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. So, x is outside y but touches y's boundary.

Given these two constraints, x and z don't share any points, so the relationship is DC(x,z).

Hmm, actually I'm still confused about the definition of NTPPi. Let me revisit the problem statement:

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Ok, so y contains z, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary). And EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Given that z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is outside y but touches y's boundary, there's a gap between x and z. They don't share any points.

Therefore, the relationship is DC(x,z).

Actually, I need to revisit the problem statement more carefully:

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Here's what I know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

To be crystal clear:
- x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these two facts, it's clear that x and z don't share any points because z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while x is outside y but touches y's boundary. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually wait, I think I've been confusing myself. Let me read the definitions once more:

From the problem:
- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

The question asks for the possible relationships between x and z.

Logically, since:
- x is outside y but touches y's boundary (from EC(x,y)).
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)).

There's a gap between x and z, so they don't share any points. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, I need to reconsider my understanding of NTPPi(y,z).

NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y).

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which implies z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, we have:
- x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts (from EC(x,y)).
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y)).

The question is: what's the relationship between x and z?

Given the spatial configuration, x is outside y (except for the boundary), and z is strictly inside y. There's a gap between x and z, so they don't share any points.

Therefore, the relationship is DC(x,z), meaning they are disconnected.

Let me just double check my logic here:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Let's break it down:
- x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This means x is outside y, but they share a boundary point.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

If x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary, then there's a gap between x and z. They don't share any points.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), meaning they are disconnected.

One more time: if EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), then the relationship between x and z is DC(x, z).

Actually, let's verify this with a specific example:

Imagine y is a disc in a 2D plane, x is another disc that touches y on the boundary, and z is a smaller disc strictly inside y and not touching y's boundary. In this configuration, x and z are clearly disconnected.

Let's verify the constraints:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. ✓
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. ✓

And in this configuration, x and z are disconnected, so the relationship is DC(x,z). ✓

I'm now confident that the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me read the problem statement one more time to ensure I've understood the definitions correctly.

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

I got that correct.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Let's break it down again:
- x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This means x is outside y, but they share a boundary point.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

If x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary, then there's a gap between x and z. They don't share any points.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), meaning they are disconnected.

Let me verify with a 3D example:

Imagine y is a sphere, x is another sphere that touches y on the boundary, and z is a smaller sphere strictly inside y and not touching y's boundary. In this configuration, x and z are clearly disconnected.

Let's verify the constraints:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. ✓
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. ✓

And in this configuration, x and z are disconnected, so the relationship is DC(x,z). ✓

Again, I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

But just to be a bit more paranoid: 

In the problem statement:

"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)"

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y).

But wait, actually I just realized I potentially made an error. So we have:

NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y)

So NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Earlier, I kept saying, "NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y". But this isn't correct. It's the other way around: y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me reconsider with the correct interpretation:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. And x touches y's boundary.

If y is strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then x must be inside z. But x could potentially touch z's boundary, or it could be strictly inside z.

The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible. If x touches y's boundary and y is strictly inside z, then x must at least be inside z or touch z's boundary. It can't be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and just touches z's boundary without entering z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x partially enters z (because it touches y's boundary) but also extends outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because z contains y (which touches x), so z can't be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because z contains y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so z is larger than y. And if x is just touching y's boundary, then x can't be equal to z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But wait, let me double-check my interpretation:

From the problem:
"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y).

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

But no, I just realized that I'm overcomplicating things by confusing myself. Let's go back to the definitions:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). And NTPP(z,y) means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's put it all together:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, y contains z, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary). And x touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

Given these constraints, it's clear that x and z don't share any points. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Ok here's my final answer:
If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

First, let me understand what we know:

1. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, which means they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

2. NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze their spatial arrangement:
- x is outside of y but touches y's boundary
- z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Given this arrangement, there must be some distance between x and z. Since x only touches the boundary of y, and z is strictly inside y without touching its boundary, there's no way for x and z to be in contact or overlap.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
