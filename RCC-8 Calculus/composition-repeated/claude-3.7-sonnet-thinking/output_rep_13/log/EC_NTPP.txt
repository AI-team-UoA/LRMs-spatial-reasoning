PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully. We have the following:
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? Well, x touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So it seems like x could be completely outside of z, making them disconnected. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Is this possible? Since y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, it seems like x could also touch z at its boundary. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other. Is this possible? Yes, x could overlap with z partially, where some part of x is inside z and some part is outside. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible because if x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must extend at least to y's boundary, which means it can't be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z). We have EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at their boundaries. We also have NTPP(y,z), which means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Could x also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary? 

Let's think about it geometrically. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then there's some "buffer zone" between y and the boundary of z. If x touches y at their boundaries, then x extends to the boundary of y, but not necessarily beyond it towards the boundary of z. So it's possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's be more careful. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

If x touches y only at the boundary and doesn't share interior points with y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must extend beyond y towards the outside. This means x can't be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Hmm, I think I'm being imprecise and going back and forth. Let me think more carefully.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. So x is outside of y, but touches y at the boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So y is inside z, and there's a "buffer zone" between y and the boundary of z.

Now, if x touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior points with y, then x is outside of y. But y is inside z with a buffer zone. So x could be:
- Completely outside of z (DC(x,z))
- Touching z at the boundary (EC(x,z))
- Partially overlapping with z (PO(x,z))
- Completely inside z and touching z's boundary (TPP(x,z))

But x can't be completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(x,z)) because x touches y at the boundary, and y already has a buffer zone from the boundary of z.

Let's continue with the other relations:

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible? If z contains y completely, and y touches x at the boundary, then z can't be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is definitely not possible for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. Is this possible? If y is properly inside z and x touches y only at the boundary, then x and z can't be coincident. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)

Wait, let me double-check TPP(x,z). This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x touches y only at the boundary and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, can x be completely inside z? 

Let's think geometrically. If y is completely inside z with a buffer zone, and x touches y at the boundary, then x extends to the boundary of y. But since y has a buffer zone from the boundary of z, x would need to extend beyond the buffer zone to touch the boundary of z. This means x can't be completely inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, I'm still not being precise. Let me try again with a concrete example. Imagine z is a big circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x is another shape that touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

Now, x could be:
- Completely outside of z (DC(x,z))
- Touching z at the boundary (EC(x,z))
- Partially overlapping with z (PO(x,z))

But x can't be completely inside z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)) because x touches y at the boundary, and y already has a buffer zone from the boundary of z. So x must extend at least to the boundary of y, which means it can't be completely inside z unless it also overlaps with y, which contradicts EC(x,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, I think I might be overlooking something. Let's reconsider TPP(x,z) more carefully.

TPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y (EC(x,y)), can x be completely inside z and touch z's boundary?

Let's think geometrically again. If y is completely inside z with a buffer zone, and x touches y at the boundary, then x extends to the boundary of y. Now, if x is also completely inside z, then x must be in the buffer zone between y and the boundary of z, and it must also touch the boundary of z. This means x forms a "bridge" from the boundary of y to the boundary of z.

Is this possible? Yes, it seems so. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x as a thin "arm" that extends from the boundary of y to the boundary of z without overlapping with y. In this case, x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, which means TPP(x,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility after all.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)

Let me double-check each of these:

1. DC(x,z): x is completely outside of z. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and extends completely outside of z.
2. EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary but doesn't overlap with z. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and also touches z at the boundary without overlapping with z.
3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and extends both inside and outside of z.
4. TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and extends to the boundary of z without extending outside of z.

All of these seem valid, so my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) one more time with a different approach. 

TPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. 

We have EC(x,y), which means x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. 

We also have NTPP(y,z), which means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So, y is properly inside z, and x touches y at the boundary. Now, if x is completely inside z, then x and y together form a connected region that is completely inside z. But since y doesn't touch the boundary of z (due to NTPP(y,z)), the only way for x to touch the boundary of z is if x extends from the boundary of y to the boundary of z. This means x forms a "bridge" from y to the boundary of z.

Is this possible while maintaining EC(x,y)? EC(x,y) means x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. If x forms a "bridge" from y to the boundary of z, it still only touches y at the boundary and doesn't overlap with y, so EC(x,y) is maintained.

Therefore, TPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me carefully check my original list of the RCC-8 relations and see if I missed any possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and extends completely outside of z.
2. EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary but doesn't overlap with z. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and also touches z at the boundary without overlapping with z.
3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and extends both inside and outside of z.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and extends to the boundary of z without extending outside of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is not possible because if x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must extend at least to the boundary of y, which means it can't be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because if z contains y completely, and y touches x at the boundary, then z can't be completely inside x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as above.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible because if y is properly inside z and x touches y only at the boundary, then x and z can't be coincident.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(x,z).

Actually, I made an error. Let me re-examine relation 5, NTPP(x,z).

NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. 

We have EC(x,y), which means x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. 

We also have NTPP(y,z), which means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

If x touches y at the boundary and doesn't overlap with y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x extends to the boundary of y. Can x also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Yes, this is possible. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x as another shape that touches y at the boundary but is also completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This can happen if x is in the "buffer zone" between y and the boundary of z, touching y but not extending all the way to the boundary of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility after all.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I made a mistake yet again. Let's think about this more carefully using the formal definitions of the RCC-8 relations.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. In other words, the intersection of x and y is non-empty, but the intersection of their interiors is empty.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means the intersection of x and z is empty. Is this possible? If x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, then x must also intersect with z (at least at the point where x touches y). So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Oh wait, I think I'm confusing myself. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But "touch at their boundaries" doesn't necessarily mean they have to share a point. It means their closures intersect, but their interiors don't.

Actually, let's be precise here. For two regions A and B:
- DC(A,B) means A ∩ B = ∅
- EC(A,B) means (A° ∩ B°) = ∅ and A ∩ B ≠ ∅

Where A° represents the interior of A.

So EC(x,y) means that the interiors of x and y don't intersect, but x and y themselves do intersect (at their boundaries).

Now, if x and y intersect at their boundaries, and y is completely inside z, then x and z must also intersect. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, wait a minute. Let's be even more precise. For two regions A and B:
- DC(A,B) means A ∩ B = ∅
- EC(A,B) means (A° ∩ B°) = ∅ and A ∩ B ≠ ∅
- NTPP(A,B) means A ⊂ B° (A is a subset of the interior of B)

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have:
- (x° ∩ y°) = ∅ and x ∩ y ≠ ∅
- y ⊂ z°

Now, can we have DC(x,z), i.e., x ∩ z = ∅? If x intersects with y (from EC(x,y)) and y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), then x must also intersect with z. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let's double-check our reasoning using a mathematical approach. If a point p is in both x and y (i.e., p ∈ x ∩ y), and y is a subset of z (i.e., y ⊂ z), then p must also be in z (i.e., p ∈ z). This means x ∩ z ≠ ∅, which contradicts DC(x,z).

Alright I think I've been overthinking this problem. Let me reason through it by thinking about Venn diagrams.

1. Given EC(x,y):
This means x and y have a non-empty intersection, but their interiors don't intersect. Essentially, they touch at their boundaries. We can visualize this as two regions that touch at their boundaries.

2. Given NTPP(y,z):
This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We can visualize this as y being a smaller region completely contained within a larger region z, with some "buffer zone" between the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are completely disjoint. But since x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, it's impossible for x and z to be disjoint. x must at least intersect with z at the point where it touches y. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at the boundary and extends to the boundary of z without entering the interior of z. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other. Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at the boundary and extends both inside and outside of z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at the boundary and extends to the boundary of z without extending outside of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at the boundary but doesn't extend to the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible? No, because z contains y completely, and y touches x at the boundary. So z can't be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. Is this possible? No, because if y is properly inside z and x touches y only at the boundary, then x and z can't be coincident. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning about DC(x,z). I said it's not possible because x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, so x must at least intersect with z at the point where it touches y. This is true, but I need to make sure that "completely inside" means "within the interior and not touching the boundary".

Let's clarify the definition of NTPP(y,z): this means y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is a subset of z and not equal to z), and y doesn't touch the boundary of z. 

Given EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at the boundary. Since y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, any point on the boundary of y is in the interior of z. If x touches y at such a point, then x must intersect with the interior of z, which means x and z can't be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I now realize that I made an incorrect deduction earlier. Let me check DC(x,z) more carefully. 

Given EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries. Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

I previously said that if x touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside z, then x must intersect with z. But I need to be more careful here. If x touches y at the boundary, it means there's a point p that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y. Now, since y is completely inside z, this point p is also in z. But since p is on the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z, p must be in the interior of z. So, p is in both x and z, which means x and z intersect. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double-check NTPP(x,z). This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), can we have NTPP(x,z)?

If x touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching the boundary of z, then x can be completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. This is possible if x extends from the boundary of y but doesn't reach the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me double-check one more time. DC(x,z) means x and z are disjoint. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside z, then x must also intersect with z (at least at the point where it touches y). So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me carefully check DC(x,z) one more time. DC(x,z) means x and z are disjoint, i.e., they don't share any points. 

Given EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This means there's at least one point that is both in x and in y. 

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means every point in y is also in z.

Now, if there's a point that is both in x and in y, and every point in y is also in z, then there's a point that is both in x and in z. This means x and z share at least one point, so they can't be disjoint. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

So I think my conclusion that the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) is correct.

Just to make sure I'm being rigorous, let me check EC(x,z) again. EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. 

Given EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. 

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, can x touch z at the boundary without sharing interior points with z? Yes, if x extends from the boundary of y to the boundary of z without entering the interior of z. However, the point where x touches y is in the interior of z (since y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z). This means x and z share at least one interior point, so they can't be externally connected. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

I was incorrect again. Let me think more carefully.

EC(x,z) means the interiors of x and z don't intersect, but their closures do. In other words, they touch at their boundaries.

Given EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. There's a point p that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means every point in y, including those on its boundary, is in the interior of z.

Now, if point p is on the boundary of y, and every point on the boundary of y is in the interior of z, then p is in the interior of z. But p is also on the boundary of x. This means the boundary of x intersects with the interior of z, which doesn't necessarily mean the interior of x intersects with the interior of z. So EC(x,z) is still a possibility.

Actually, wait a minute. If the boundary of x intersects with the interior of z, then x and z are not externally connected. External connection means they touch at their boundaries, not that the boundary of one intersects with the interior of the other. So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

OK, OK. I see my error. Let me be very precise with the definitions and use them consistently:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, i.e., they don't share any points.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, i.e., they have a common part, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical.

Given EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. There's a point p that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. In other words, y is completely inside z, and there's a "buffer zone" between the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z don't share any points. But since x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, x must share at least one point with z (the point where it touches y). So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. If x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, then the point where x touches y is in the interior of z. This means the interior of z intersects with x. If this intersection is with the boundary of x, then the interior of z intersects with the boundary of x, which still means x and z are not externally connected. If this intersection is with the interior of x, then the interiors of x and z intersect, which also means x and z are not externally connected. So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, let me double-check this. If the interior of z intersects with the boundary of x, it doesn't necessarily mean the interior of x intersects with the interior of z. Let me re-evaluate my conclusion about EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means the interiors of x and z don't intersect, but their closures do. Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we know that x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z. The point where x touches y is on the boundary of y and the boundary of x. Since y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, this point is in the interior of z. So the boundary of x intersects with the interior of z.

Now, can the interiors of x and z not intersect? If the boundary of x intersects with the interior of z, and x is a connected region, then either the interior of x is completely outside of z, or it intersects with the interior of z. If the interior of x is completely outside of z, then x and z are disconnected except for the point(s) where the boundary of x intersects with the interior of z. But this doesn't match any of the RCC-8 relations. So, the interior of x must intersect with the interior of z, which means x and z are not externally connected. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, I'm being imprecise again. Let me be more careful.

The RCC-8 relations are based on the intersection of the interiors and boundaries of the regions. For two regions A and B:
- DC(A,B): A and B are disconnected, i.e., A ∩ B = ∅.
- EC(A,B): A and B are externally connected, i.e., (A° ∩ B°) = ∅ and A ∩ B ≠ ∅.

Given EC(x,y), we know that (x° ∩ y°) = ∅ and x ∩ y ≠ ∅. Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y ⊂ z° and y ≠ z.

Now, let's consider DC(x,z), which would mean x ∩ z = ∅. Since x ∩ y ≠ ∅ (from EC(x,y)) and y ⊂ z (from NTPP(y,z)), we have x ∩ z ≠ ∅. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Next, let's consider EC(x,z), which would mean (x° ∩ z°) = ∅ and x ∩ z ≠ ∅. We've already established that x ∩ z ≠ ∅. Now, can we have (x° ∩ z°) = ∅? 

Given EC(x,y), we know that (x° ∩ y°) = ∅, which means the intersection of x and y is on their boundaries. Let's denote this intersection point as p. So p is on the boundary of x and on the boundary of y.

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y ⊂ z°, which means every point in y, including those on its boundary, is in the interior of z. So p, which is on the boundary of y, is in the interior of z.

So, we have p on the boundary of x and in the interior of z. This doesn't directly tell us whether the interior of x intersects with the interior of z. It's possible for the boundary of x to intersect with the interior of z without the interior of x intersecting with the interior of z. So EC(x,z) is still a possibility.

Actually, no, I don't think that's right. If p is on the boundary of x and in the interior of z, and x is a connected region, then either the interior of x is completely outside of z, or it intersects with the interior of z. If the interior of x is completely outside of z, then x and z are not even connected, which contradicts the fact that they share at least one point (p). So, the interior of x must intersect with the interior of z, which means (x° ∩ z°) ≠ ∅. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Argh, I'm overthinking this. Let's try a different approach.

Imagine two circles, y inside a big circle z, with some distance between the boundaries. Now, if x touches y at the boundary (e.g, a line from outside y that touches y's boundary), then x must penetrate into the interior of z to reach y. This means the interior of x and the interior of z intersect, so x and z are not externally connected. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check PO(x,z). This means x and z partially overlap, i.e., they have a common part, but neither is a part of the other. 

Given EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. 

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, then part of x is inside z (the part that touches y). Can part of x be outside z? Yes, if x extends beyond the boundary of z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me double-check TPP(x,z). This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Given EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. 

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, can x be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z? Yes, if x extends from the boundary of y to the boundary of z without extending outside of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me double-check NTPP(x,z). This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. 

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, can x be completely inside z without touching the boundary of z? Yes, if x extends from the boundary of y but doesn't reach the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me double-check TPPi(x,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x.

Given EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. 

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If y is completely inside z and x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y, can z be completely inside x? No, because if z contains y completely, and x only touches y at the boundary without overlapping with y, then z can't be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double-check NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Given EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. 

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If y is completely inside z and x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y, can z be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x? No, for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double-check EQ(x,z), which means x and z are identical.

Given EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y. 

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If y is completely inside z and x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y, can x and z be identical? No, because if z contains y completely, and x only touches y at the boundary without overlapping with y, then x and z can't be identical. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider DC(x,z). 

DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected, i.e., they don't share any points. Given EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries, so they share at least one point, let's call it p. Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z, so every point in y is also in z. Since p is in y (on its boundary), p is also in z. And since p is also in x, x and z share at least one point. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me reconsider EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. There's a point p that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y. Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means every point in y, including those on its boundary, is in the interior of z. So p, which is on the boundary of y, is in the interior of z. But p is also on the boundary of x. So, the boundary of x intersects with the interior of z. 

Now, let's consider the formal definition of EC. If we denote the boundary of a region A as ∂A, then EC(A,B) means (A° ∩ B°) = ∅ and (∂A ∩ ∂B) ≠ ∅. In other words, the interiors of A and B don't intersect, but their boundaries do.

Given that the boundary of x intersects with the interior of z, we know that (∂x ∩ z°) ≠ ∅. But for EC(x,z) to be true, we also need (∂x ∩ ∂z) ≠ ∅ and (x° ∩ z°) = ∅. The condition (∂x ∩ z°) ≠ ∅ doesn't directly tell us whether these conditions are met or not.

But as I've argued above, if x is a connected region and its boundary intersects with the interior of z, then either the interior of x is completely outside of z, or it intersects with the interior of z. If the interior of x is completely outside of z, then x and z are not even connected, which contradicts the fact that they share at least one point. So, the interior of x must intersect with the interior of z, which means (x° ∩ z°) ≠ ∅. This contradicts the condition for EC(x,z), which requires (x° ∩ z°) = ∅. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given that EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (there's a "buffer zone" between y's boundary and z's boundary)

Now I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside z, x must share at least one point with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. The point where x touches y is on y's boundary, which must be in the interior of z (due to NTPP(y,z)). This means x penetrates into z's interior, so they can't be merely externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at the boundary and partially overlap with z, with some parts inside z and some parts outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z while touching z's boundary, forming a "bridge" from y's boundary to z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary if it extends from y's boundary but doesn't reach z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. Since y is completely inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, z cannot be contained inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If y is properly inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be identical.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
