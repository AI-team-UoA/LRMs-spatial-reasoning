PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

In this case, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy the same spatial region)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts

Because EQ(x,y) means that x and y occupy exactly the same spatial region, any spatial relationship that y has with z must also be the same relationship that x has with z.

Given that y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), this means that x and z must also be disconnected.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let's double-check this using the properties of the RCC-8 relations:

- EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical in spatial extent
- DC(y,z) means y and z share no points and have no contact

Since x and y occupy exactly the same region (EQ(x,y)), and y has no contact or overlap with z (DC(y,z)), it follows that x also has no contact or overlap with z.

So the answer is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship must hold between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no points and have no contact)

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical in their spatial extent, any spatial relationship that y has with another region must also hold for x with that same region.

Therefore, if y is disconnected from z, then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
