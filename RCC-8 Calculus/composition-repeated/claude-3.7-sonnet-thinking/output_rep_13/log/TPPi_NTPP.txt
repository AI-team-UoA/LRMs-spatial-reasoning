PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We are given that:
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y and z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think about this.

Since y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and z is a proper part of y (from NTPP(y,z)), it follows that z is a proper part of x. This is a transitive relationship: if z is part of y and y is part of x, then z is part of x.

Now, we need to determine whether z is a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x.

We know:
- y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches x's boundary.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z does not touch y's boundary.

Given these conditions, can z touch x's boundary?

Since z does not touch y's boundary, and y is a proper part of x, z is not going to touch x's boundary either. This is because any point on the boundary of x is either also on the boundary of y or it's outside of y. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't touch any point that's on the boundary of y. And since z is inside y, it can't touch any point outside of y. Thus, z can't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or in the RCC-8 notation, NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this reasoning. 

We have:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(y,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, y contains z (z is inside y), and x contains y (y is inside x). Therefore, x contains z (z is inside x).

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x. If z touches the boundary of x, then the relation would be TPPi(x,z). If z does not touch the boundary of x, then the relation would be NTPPi(x,z).

We know:
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- z does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(y,z)).

Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside x, z must be inside x and not touching x's boundary. 

Actually, wait, I need to be more careful. We need to think about whether z can touch x's boundary. 

y touches x's boundary, which means there's at least one point that's both in y and on the boundary of x. 

z is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary. This means z is strictly inside y, away from y's boundary.

Now, can z touch x's boundary? For z to touch x's boundary, it would need to have a point in common with x's boundary. But every point of z is inside y, and only the boundary of y touches the boundary of x. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, it can't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which in RCC-8 notation is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I realize I'm still not being as rigorous as I should be. Let's think about this one more time.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

So, z is inside y, and y is inside x. This implies z is inside x (or, in terms of the RCC-8 relations, either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x), depending on whether z touches x's boundary or not).

Now, the question is: Can z touch x's boundary while being inside y and not touching y's boundary?

For z to touch x's boundary, z would need to have at least one point on x's boundary. But all of z is inside y, and only points on y's boundary can potentially be on x's boundary. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), z can't have any points on x's boundary.

Therefore, z is inside x and does not touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or, in the inverted notation, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I should be a bit more careful with the spatial aspects.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. Every part of y is also a part of x.
2. Not every part of x is a part of y.
3. y touches x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. Every part of z is also a part of y.
2. Not every part of y is a part of z.
3. z does not touch y's boundary.

From TPPi(x,y), we can infer that y touches the boundary of x at some point. Let's call this point on the boundary of x as "p". Since y touches x at p, point p is also on the boundary of y.

Now, from NTPP(y,z), we know that z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This means that none of the points in z is on the boundary of y, including the point p.

Since every part of z is a part of y (from NTPP(y,z)), and every part of y is a part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), it follows that every part of z is a part of x.

Furthermore, since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and the point p (where y touches the boundary of x) is on the boundary of y, z also doesn't touch the boundary of x at p.

However, there could be other points on the boundary of x that are not on the boundary of y. We know that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means that some, but not all, of the boundary of x is touched by y.

Can z touch the boundary of x at a point that is not on the boundary of y?

No, it can't. If z touches the boundary of x, then that point would also be on the boundary of z. But all of z is inside y, and none of the points in z are on the boundary of y. The boundary of x is entirely outside of y except at the points where y touches the boundary of x (like point p). Since z is entirely inside y, it can't touch the boundary of x at points that are outside of y.

Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x at any point. This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or, in the inverted notation, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, but I'm now realizing that this still isn't quite right. Let's be very precise with the definitions of the RCC-8 relations.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. y is a proper part of x (every part of y is a part of x, and not every part of x is a part of y).
2. y touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. z is a proper part of y (every part of z is a part of y, and not every part of y is a part of z).
2. z does not touch the boundary of y.

From these, we can infer:
1. z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. By transitivity, z is a proper part of x.

Now, the question is whether z is a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x.

For z to be a tangential proper part of x, it would need to touch the boundary of x. Let's denote the interiors of x, y, and z as x°, y°, and z°, respectively. And let's denote the boundaries as ∂x, ∂y, and ∂z.

From TPPi(x,y), we know that y touches the boundary of x, which means ∂y ∩ ∂x is non-empty.

From NTPP(y,z), we know that z does not touch the boundary of y, which means z ⊆ y° (z is a subset of the interior of y).

For z to touch the boundary of x, we'd need ∂z ∩ ∂x to be non-empty. But, given that z ⊆ y°, and the interior and boundary of a region are disjoint, we have:

∂z ∩ ∂x = ∂z ∩ (∂x ∩ y° ∪ ∂x ∩ (X \ y°)), where X is the entire space.

Since ∂z ⊆ y° (as z ⊆ y°), and y° ∩ (X \ y°) is empty, we have:

∂z ∩ ∂x = ∂z ∩ (∂x ∩ y°)

For this to be non-empty, there must be a point that is on the boundary of x and in the interior of y. But, by definition, the boundary of a region does not include its interior. Therefore, ∂x ∩ y° is empty.

Hence, ∂z ∩ ∂x is empty, which means z does not touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or, in the inverted notation, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I think I've been misreading the question. Let me reconsider: TPPi(x,y) means x is a TPPi of y, which means x *contains* y, with y touching the boundary of x. And NTPP(y,z) means y *contains* z, with z not touching the boundary of y.

So we have:
- x contains y, and they touch at the boundary of x.
- y contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, transitively, x contains z. But the question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not, which would determine if the relation is TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Given that y touches the boundary of x, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), z is strictly inside x and not touching x's boundary. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, let me be even more rigorous. 

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So:
- y is a proper part of x.
- The boundary of y and the boundary of x have at least one point in common.

NTPP(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So:
- z is a proper part of y.
- The boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common.

From these, we can infer:
- z is a proper part of x (by transitivity).
- The boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common.
- The boundary of y and the boundary of x have at least one point in common.

For z to be a tangential proper part of x, the boundary of z and the boundary of x would need to have at least one point in common. Let's denote a point on the boundary of x as p, such that p is also on the boundary of y (we know such a point exists from TPPi(x,y)).

Can p also be on the boundary of z? No, because from NTPP(y,z), we know that the boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common.

Can there be a different point q on the boundary of x, such that q is also on the boundary of z? If such a point q exists, it would be on the boundary of x but not on the boundary of y (since the boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common). But this would mean that z is not entirely inside y, which contradicts NTPP(y,z).

Therefore, the boundary of z and the boundary of x have no points in common, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm not being careful here. Let me take a step back.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That means:
- y is a proper part of x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That means:
- z is a proper part of y.
- z does not touch the boundary of y.

From the first, we know that y ⊂ x (y is a proper subset of x) and ∂y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅ (the boundary of y and the boundary of x have at least one point in common).

From the second, we know that z ⊂ y (z is a proper subset of y) and ∂z ∩ ∂y = ∅ (the boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common).

By transitivity, we know that z ⊂ x (z is a proper subset of x). The question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

For z to touch the boundary of x, we would need ∂z ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅.

We know that z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. The boundary of y has points both inside x and on the boundary of x (since y touches the boundary of x).

Since z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, z is separated from the boundary of x by at least the boundary of y. This means z can't touch the boundary of x, so ∂z ∩ ∂x = ∅.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I think I'm getting confused because I'm not being consistent with my analysis. Let me refocus.

TPPi(x,y) means that x contains y tangentially, or in other words, y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPP(y,z) means that y contains z non-tangentially, or in other words, z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

From TPPi(x,y), we know:
- y is a proper part of x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

From NTPP(y,z), we know:
- z is a proper part of y.
- z does not touch the boundary of y.

By transitivity of the "proper part" relation, if z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, then z is a proper part of x.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? If it does, then the relation would be TPP(z,x), or equivalently, TPPi(x,z). If it doesn't, then the relation would be NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

We know that z doesn't touch the boundary of y. And y doesn't completely overlap with the boundary of x; there are parts of the boundary of x that y doesn't touch (since y is a proper part of x). So, z, which is inside y and away from y's boundary, certainly can't touch the parts of x's boundary that y doesn't touch.

What about the parts of x's boundary that y does touch? Can z touch those parts? No, because z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and the parts of x's boundary that y touches are on the boundary of y.

Therefore, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means the relation between z and x is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, let me triple check this.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which implies that y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Transitively, z is a proper part of x (NTPP(z,x) or TPP(z,x), depending on whether z touches the boundary of x).

For z to touch the boundary of x, there needs to be a point p such that p is on both the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Let's see if such a point can exist.

Any point p on the boundary of z is inside y (since z is a proper part of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y). 

Now, for p to be on the boundary of x, it would have to be on the boundary of y as well (since any part of y that touches the boundary of x is on the boundary of y). But z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Therefore, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means the relation between z and x is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, actually I think I may still be conflating things. Let me be crystal clear.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means:
- y is a proper part of x.
- The boundary of y and the boundary of x have at least one point in common.

NTPP(y,z) means:
- z is a proper part of y.
- The boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common.

From these, we can deduce:
- z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x (by transitivity).
- The boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common, and the boundary of y has a point in common with the boundary of x. 

Now, can the boundary of z have a point in common with the boundary of x? 

Assume there's a point p on the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Since z is a proper part of y, every point of z, including points on the boundary of z, is in y. 

Is p on the boundary of y? No, because we know the boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common.

So, p is in y but not on the boundary of y, which means p is in the interior of y. But if p is on the boundary of x, then p is not in the interior of x. This creates a contradiction, because if p is in the interior of y, and y is a proper part of x, then p must be in the interior of x, not on its boundary.

Therefore, the boundary of z and the boundary of x have no points in common, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I think I need to be a bit more careful with the definition of "interior" and "boundary". Let me reconsider:

For a region r, let's denote its interior as r° and its boundary as ∂r. The region r itself is the union of its interior and boundary: r = r° ∪ ∂r.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means:
- y is a proper part of x, so y ⊂ x.
- y and x share at least one boundary point, so ∂y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅.

NTPP(y,z) means:
- z is a proper part of y, so z ⊂ y.
- z does not touch the boundary of y, so ∂z ∩ ∂y = ∅, which means z ⊂ y°.

From these, we can deduce:
- z ⊂ y ⊂ x, so z ⊂ x.
- z ⊂ y°, which means every point in z, including points on its boundary, is in the interior of y.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x? In other words, is ∂z ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅?

If there's a point p on both the boundary of z and the boundary of x, then p is in the interior of y (since z, including its boundary, is in the interior of y). But y can't have a point in its interior that's on the boundary of x, because if y ⊂ x, then y° ⊂ x°.

Therefore, ∂z ∩ ∂x = ∅, which means z does not touch the boundary of x. The relation between z and x is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try one more time.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): x contains y tangentially. This means y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y contains z non-tangentially. This means z is a proper part of y and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

From these, we can infer:
- z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x.

The key question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

Given that z doesn't touch the boundary of y, it must be entirely inside y. And since y is tangentially inside x, parts of y touch the boundary of x. But the crucial point is that, since z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, it's effectively insulated from touching the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me try one more approach. 

We're given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(y,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We want to know the relation between x and z.

First, let's clarify something: TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. And NTPP(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x. So, we're either looking at TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x), depending on whether z touches the boundary of x.

To understand this better, let's think spatially. 

Imagine x as a large rectangle. TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x, and touches the boundary of x at some point. Let's say y is a circle inside x, touching one side of the rectangle.

NTPP(y,z) means z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. So, z would be a smaller circle inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

In this setup, z is inside y, which is inside x. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't cover the entire boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or, equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So I'm fairly certain that if TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then NTPPi(x,z).

Let me make sure this matches the definitions of the RCC-8 calculus:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
3. PO(x,y): x and y overlap, but neither is a subset of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, but doesn't touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, but doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are the same.

From TPPi(x,y), we know y is a tangential proper part of x.
From NTPP(y,z), we know z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

From transitivity, z is a proper part of x. But the question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

Given that z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary only at specific points, z can't touch the boundary of x. This is because z is separated from the boundary of x by at least the parts of y that don't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize that I should think about composition tables for the RCC-8 calculus. Let me verify my result from the RCC-8 composition table.

In the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of TPPi with NTPP would give the possible relations between x and z. 

So we want to check the RCC-8 composition table, R1 o R2 where R1 = TPPi and R2 = NTPP.

My recollection of the RCC-8 composition table for TPPi o NTPP is that it's indeed NTPPi. Let me double-check:

In the RCC-8 composition table, TPPi o NTPP = NTPPi, which means that if TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then NTPPi(x,z).

This confirms our earlier reasoning. So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

So if TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z when TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me analyze what these given relations tell us:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

- NTPP(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

From these facts, I can determine:
1. Since y is inside x, and z is inside y, then z must be inside x (transitivity of containment).
2. The key question is whether z touches the boundary of x.
3. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y only touches x's boundary at certain points, z must be completely separated from x's boundary by at least the interior parts of y.
4. Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
