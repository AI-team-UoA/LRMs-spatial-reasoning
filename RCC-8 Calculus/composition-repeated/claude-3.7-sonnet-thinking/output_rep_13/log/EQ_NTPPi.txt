PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

First, I need to understand the given relationships:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. Since NTPPi(y,z), we know that z is a proper non-tangential part of y. Since x and y are the same, z must also be a proper non-tangential part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z would be:
NTPPi(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I need to double-check this. Let me reason through it differently.

EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same.
NTPPi(y,z) means y is a proper non-tangential part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x and y are the same (EQ(x,y)), x must also be completely contained within z and not touch z's boundary. This would mean NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm making a mistake here. Let me go back to the definitions:

- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same region).
- NTPPi(y,z): this is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means that z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

So, NTPPi(y,z) actually means that y properly contains z and z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same.
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z and z does not touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same, and y properly contains z (with z not touching y's boundary), it follows that x also properly contains z (with z not touching x's boundary).

So, the relationship between x and z would be NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to ensure I get the definition of NTPPi right. Let's verify:

NTPPi(a,b) is the inverse of NTPP(a,b). NTPP(a,b) means that a is a proper part of b and does not touch b's boundary. So, NTPPi(a,b) means that b is a proper part of a and does not touch a's boundary.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same, it follows that z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z would be NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to double-check by going back to the original definitions:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same.
- NTPPi(y,z): same as NTPP(z,y), so z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same, and z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary, it follows that z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z would be NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is: NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, just to triple-check, let me reason through this from a slightly different angle.

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. So, any relation that y has with z, x should also have with z.

Given NTPPi(y,z), this means that z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same, and z is completely inside y not touching y's boundary, it follows that z is completely inside x not touching x's boundary.

This corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the final answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I'm realizing I've been flipping the interpretation of NTPPi. Let me make sure I get this right.

NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse of NTPP(y,z).
NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same, and z is a proper part of y not touching y's boundary, it follows that z is a proper part of x not touching x's boundary.

This corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the final answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Just to be super clear, let's check the inverse interpretation as well:

NTPP(a,b) means a is a proper part of b and doesn't touch b's boundary.
NTPPi(a,b) means b is a proper part of a and doesn't touch a's boundary.

Given NTPPi(y,z), we have NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same, so z is also a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This means NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So, once again, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how x relates to z given the two conditions:

1. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident (they are exactly the same region)
2. NTPPi(y,z) - y contains z as a proper part and z does not touch y's boundary

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical regions. This means that any spatial relation y has with another region, x will have the exact same relation with that region.

Given that NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary, and since x and y are identical, it follows that z must also be a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
