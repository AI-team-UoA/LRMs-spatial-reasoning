PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are equal or coincident. They occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Given these two conditions, I need to determine the possible relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are the same region. This means that any relation that holds between x and y will also hold between x and z.

Since NTPP(x,y), we know that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. Because y and z are the same (EQ(y,z)), x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y without touching its boundary
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region
- Therefore, x must be completely inside z without touching its boundary, which is the definition of NTPP(x,z)

The answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relation x has with z given NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y - x is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Since y and z are exactly the same region (EQ(y,z)), and x is completely inside y without touching its boundary (NTPP(x,y)), then x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
