PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to analyze what the relationships TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) tell us, and then determine the possible RCC-8 relationship between x and z.

First, let's recall the definitions:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are spatially equal or coincident. They occupy exactly the same space.

Given that EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are identical in spatial extent. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z is equivalent to y (from EQ(y,z)), z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is:
TPPi(x,z)

To double-check this:
- If y is completely contained within x (TPPi(x,y)), and z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), then z must also be completely contained within x in the same way.
- The "tangential" aspect (touching the boundary) remains the same for z as it was for y, since they occupy the same space.

So, the answer is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me verify this with a different approach.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are spatially equal.

If y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is equal to y, then z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

So, TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

The answer is TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the given relations combine to establish the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are spatially identical (they occupy exactly the same region)

Since y and z are identical (EQ relation), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

If y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)), and z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), then z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
