PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So x is entirely contained within y without touching y's boundary.

2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that x is entirely contained within y (NTPP(x,y)), and y is entirely contained within z (TPP(y,z)), we can deduce that x is entirely contained within z. So x is a proper part of z.

The question is whether x touches z's boundary or not. Let's think about this:

- x does not touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)).
- y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)).

Since x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y may touch z's boundary at specific points, it's possible that x doesn't touch z's boundary. In this case, the relation would be NTPP(x,z).

However, it's also possible that x does touch z's boundary, especially if y touches z's boundary at a point that's adjacent to x. In this case, the relation would be TPP(x,z).

Let's think about this more carefully:

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

If y touches z's boundary at a point p, can x also touch z's boundary at the same point p? No, because if x touched z's boundary at p, then x would also touch y's boundary at p (since y and z share the boundary at p), which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, x cannot touch z's boundary. The only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider. There might be a flaw in my reasoning above.

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

If y touches z's boundary at a point p, can x also touch z's boundary at a point q (different from p)? No, because if x touched z's boundary at q, then x would also touch y's boundary at q (since if q is on z's boundary and also in x, then q must also be on y's boundary), which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning once more:

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

Given these conditions, x is definitely completely inside z. The question is whether x can touch z's boundary.

If x touches z's boundary at a point q, then q is a point in x and on the boundary of z. But since x is completely inside y, q is also a point in y. Since q is a point in y and on the boundary of z, and y is a tangential proper part of z, q is a point where y touches z's boundary.

Now, can q also be a point on the boundary of y? If q is on the boundary of y, and x contains q, then x would touch the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So, q cannot be on the boundary of y.

But if q is not on the boundary of y, then q is in the interior of y. But if q is on the boundary of z and in the interior of y, then y would not be tangential to z at q, which contradicts TPP(y,z).

So, it seems like x cannot touch z's boundary, and the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm complicating things unnecessarily.

Let's think about it geometrically:

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y without touching its boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and touches its boundary.

Given these, x is definitely completely inside z. The question is whether x can touch z's boundary.

Since x doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't extend beyond z's boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hold on, let me reconsider. I think I might be making an unwarranted assumption. Let me think of an example to see if x can touch z's boundary.

Imagine:
- z is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching the boundary of z at one point.
- x is an even smaller circle inside y.

If x is positioned such that it touches the boundary of z at the same point where y touches z, then we'd have TPP(x,z). But this would contradict NTPP(x,y) because x would also touch the boundary of y.

Ok, given that x is completely inside y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (from TPP(y,z)), and y touches z's boundary, can x touch z's boundary?

Let's say that x touches z's boundary at a point p. Since x is completely inside y, p is also a point in y. Since p is on the boundary of z and is a point in y, p is a point where y touches the boundary of z.

But now, since p is a point in x and is on the boundary of z, is p also on the boundary of y? If p is on the boundary of y, then x would touch the boundary of y, contradicting NTPP(x,y). If p is not on the boundary of y, then it's in the interior of y, but then y wouldn't touch z's boundary at p, contradicting TPP(y,z).

I think the crux of the matter is the relationship between the boundaries. If p is a point on the boundary of z that is also contained in y, then p must be on the boundary of y (given TPP(y,z)). So, if x touches z's boundary at p, x must also touch y's boundary at p. But this contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, x cannot touch z's boundary, and the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think the geometric intuition is more straightforward: If x is completely inside y without touching its boundary, and y is completely inside z and touches its boundary, then x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. This means NTPP(x,z).

To make sure, let's try to construct a counterexample. If we want TPP(x,z), then x should touch the boundary of z. But if x touches the boundary of z at a point p, then p is also a point in y (since x is inside y). Since y touches z's boundary at p, p is on the boundary of y. But if p is on the boundary of y and is also a point in x, then x touches the boundary of y, contradicting NTPP(x,y).

So, I'm confident that the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I'm realizing that the problem might be more complex. Let me think of a concrete example to better understand the constraints.

Consider a scenario where:
- z is a big square.
- y is a smaller square inside z, with one of its corners touching the boundary of z.
- x is an even smaller square inside y, positioned away from the corner where y touches z.

In this scenario, NTPP(x,y) (x is completely inside y without touching its boundary) and TPP(y,z) (y is completely inside z and touches its boundary).

But what's the relation between x and z? Since x is completely inside y and doesn't touch its boundary, and y is completely inside z, x is completely inside z. The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

Given the positioning I described, x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z).

But could there be a different positioning of x within y such that x touches the boundary of z? If x touches the boundary of z at a point, that point must also be on the boundary of y (since y touches z's boundary at that point). But if x touches the boundary of y, then it's not NTPP(x,y).

So, it seems like the only consistent relation is NTPP(x,z).

OK so the answer is that the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually wait, I want to double-check the consistency of my answer, because the constraints are a bit subtle. Let me try a slightly different approach. 

The constraint NTPP(x,y) implies that x is fully inside y, and does not touch the boundary of y. 

The constraint TPP(y,z) implies that y is fully inside z, and does touch the boundary of z. 

Now let's think about the relation between x and z. We know that x is fully inside y, so x is also fully inside z. We need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z. 

Let's suppose x does touch the boundary of z. This would mean that there's a point p in x that's also on the boundary of z. Since x is fully inside y, this point p is also in y. But since p is on the boundary of z, and y touches the boundary of z, p must be one of the points where y touches the boundary of z. But if p is a point in x that's also on the boundary of z, can it also be on the boundary of y? 

If p is on the boundary of y, and x contains p, then x touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). 

But maybe p is in the interior of y, and y touches the boundary of z at p. But this doesn't seem right either: if p is on the boundary of z, and p is in the interior of y, then there must be points of y outside of z, which contradicts the condition that y is fully inside z (TPP(y,z)).

OK so I think that x cannot touch the boundary of z. And given that x is fully inside z, the relation must be NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me try a slightly different approach and see if I can get some insight. Let's try to use the definitions more directly. We know that NTPP(x,y) means that x is fully inside y without touching y's boundary. And TPP(y,z) means that y is fully inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given that x is fully inside y, and y is fully inside z, x is fully inside z. 

If x were to touch the boundary of z, then there would be a point p that's both in x and on the boundary of z. Since x is fully inside y, p is also in y. But since p is on the boundary of z, and y touches the boundary of z, p is one of the points where y touches the boundary of z. But if p is a point where y touches the boundary of z, then p is on the boundary of y. But if p is in x and also on the boundary of y, then x touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me rethink one part that I think has been a source of difficulty.

TPP(y,z) means that y is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. Let's call p a point where y touches the boundary of z. Then p is both in y and on the boundary of z. But is p on the boundary of y? Yes, it is. If p were in the interior of y, then there would be a neighborhood of p that's entirely within y. But if p is on the boundary of z, there's no such neighborhood (because some points near p are outside of z). Thus, p must be on the boundary of y as well.

So, if x were to touch the boundary of z, it would mean there's a point p that's both in x and on the boundary of z. Since x is fully inside y, p is also in y. But since p is on the boundary of z, and y touches the boundary of z, p is one of the points where y touches the boundary of z. And as I just established, this means p is on the boundary of y. But if p is in x and also on the boundary of y, then x touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Great! Now I'm confident that the answer is NTPP(x, z), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

As a final check, let me ensure that we've covered all possible relationships:

DC(x,z)? No, because x is inside y and y is inside z, so x and z are not disconnected.
EC(x,z)? No, because x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
PO(x,z)? No, because x is fully inside z, so they don't partially overlap.
TPP(x,z)? No, because x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
NTPP(x,z)? Yes, because x is fully inside z and doesn't touch its boundary.
TPPi(x,z)? No, because z is not a part of x.
NTPPi(x,z)? No, because z is not a part of x.
EQ(x,z)? No, because x is a proper part of z, not equal to it.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check one more time because I think I might have made an error in my reasoning earlier. I said that if p is a point on the boundary of z that is also in y, then p must be on the boundary of y. I think this may not be entirely accurate.

Consider a scenario:
- z is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching the boundary of z at a single point.
- x is an even smaller circle inside y.

In this scenario, NTPP(x,y) (x is completely inside y without touching its boundary) and TPP(y,z) (y is completely inside z and touches its boundary).

If y touches the boundary of z at a point p, then p is both on the boundary of z and on the boundary of y. If x were to also touch the boundary of z, it would have to be at a point q (not necessarily the same as p). But for x to touch the boundary of z at q, q must be both in x and on the boundary of z. But since x is fully inside y, q is also in y. But if q is on the boundary of z and is also in y, then y touches the boundary of z at q. And as I've established, any point where y touches the boundary of z is also on the boundary of y. But if q is in x and also on the boundary of y, then x touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I've checked and double-checked, and I'm confident that the answer is:

NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, but wait again. I think I've been overcomplicating this. 

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y, and no part of x touches the boundary of y.
TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z, and some part of y touches the boundary of z.

Given these two constraints, what is the relationship between x and z?

x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x is a proper part of z. The question is whether any part of x touches the boundary of z.

If any part of x touches the boundary of z, let's call that part p. Since x is fully inside y, p is also a part of y. So, p is a part of y that touches the boundary of z. But TPP(y,z) tells us that only some parts of y touch the boundary of z, not all of y. Given NTPP(x,y), no part of x touches the boundary of y. If a part of x were to touch the boundary of z, that part would also have to be on the boundary of y. But if a part of x is on the boundary of y, then x touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me re-examine the claim that if a part of y touches the boundary of z, then that part is on the boundary of y. It might not always be the case.

Consider:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller 'C' shaped region inside z, with the open end of the 'C' touching the boundary of z.
- x is a small circle inside the closed part of the 'C'.

In this scenario, y touches the boundary of z at the open end of the 'C'. But the open end of the 'C' is also a part of the boundary of y. So, the part of y that touches the boundary of z is on the boundary of y.

Is it always the case? If a part of y touches the boundary of z, is that part always on the boundary of y? I think it is. If a part of y were not on the boundary of y (i.e., in the interior of y), then there would be a neighborhood of that part that's entirely within y. But if that part is also on the boundary of z, there's no such neighborhood (because some points near it are outside of z). Hence, a part of y that touches the boundary of z must be on the boundary of y.

So, if a part of x were to touch the boundary of z, that part would also be on the boundary of y. But NTPP(x,y) tells us that no part of x is on the boundary of y. Thus, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

OK I think the answer is that the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, one moment. Just to be completely sure, let's think geometrically. Consider the simplest example:

Imagine three concentric circles: the outermost circle is z, the middle circle is y, and the innermost circle is x. The circles y and z touch at a single point (so TPP(y,z)), and the circles x and y do not touch (so NTPP(x,y)).

In this scenario, does x touch z? Clearly not, because x is the innermost circle and doesn't even touch the middle circle y. So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, the concentric circles example isn't quite right because TPP(y,z) implies that the circles y and z touch, but concentric circles don't touch.

Let's adjust the example:
- z is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching the boundary of z at a single point.
- x is an even smaller circle inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

In this scenario, NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z). The question is: does x touch the boundary of z? Given the positioning, x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But could there be a different positioning of x within y such that x touches the boundary of z? If x touches the boundary of z at a point, that point must also be a point in y (since x is inside y). And if that point is on the boundary of z, and y touches the boundary of z, then it's a point where y touches the boundary of z. But as I've established, any point where y touches the boundary of z is also on the boundary of y. So, if x touches the boundary of z, it also touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, the only consistent relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

To quickly summarize my reasoning:

1. Given that x is fully inside y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y is fully inside z (from TPP(y,z)), x is fully inside z.
2. We need to determine if x touches the boundary of z.
3. If x were to touch the boundary of z at a point p, then p would be both in x and on the boundary of z.
4. Since x is fully inside y, p is also in y.
5. Since p is on the boundary of z and is in y, p is a point where y touches the boundary of z.
6. Any point where y touches the boundary of z is also on the boundary of y.
7. But if p is on the boundary of y and is also in x, then x touches the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).
8. So, x cannot touch the boundary of z.
9. Given that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch its boundary, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is:

NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I'll analyze the constraints and determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary)

Analysis:
1. Since x is completely inside y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (from TPP(y,z)), x must be completely inside z.

2. Could x touch the boundary of z? Let's check:
   - If x were to touch z's boundary at some point p, then p would be both in x and on z's boundary
   - Since x is completely inside y, point p must also be in y
   - Since p is on z's boundary and in y, p must be one of the points where y touches z's boundary
   - But any point where y touches z's boundary must also be on y's boundary
   - If p is both in x and on y's boundary, then x touches y's boundary
   - This contradicts our given NTPP(x,y) relation

3. Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary. Since x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).
