PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. 

We know that TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). In other words, y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary.

We also know that PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Now, I need to determine all possible relationships between x and z based on these constraints.

First, let's visualize this:
- x contains y (and y touches x's boundary)
- y partially overlaps with z

Given these constraints, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is not possible because y overlaps with z, and y is contained in x, so x and z must share at least some part (through y).

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is possible if z overlaps with y only in the part where y touches x's boundary. In this case, x and z would touch but not overlap.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x. Since y is inside x and overlaps with z, z could partially extend outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This would mean x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is properly contained in x and y overlaps with z, it's not immediately clear if this is possible. Let me think more...
   If y is at the edge of x (which it is, since TPPi(x,y)), and z encompasses all of x plus more, and x touches z's boundary, then this relation is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This would mean x is properly contained in z without touching z's boundary. Given that y is at the edge of x and overlaps with z, it seems unlikely that x could be completely surrounded by z without touching its boundary. But let me double-check...
   Actually, if z is much larger than both x and y, and y's overlap with z is minimal, then it's possible for x to be completely inside z without touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since y overlaps with z and is at the edge of x, it's possible for z to be inside x and touch its boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary. If z is small and its overlap with y is minimal, this relation is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This would mean x and z occupy the exact same space. Given that y is properly contained in x and y overlaps with z but is not contained in z (due to PO(y,z)), x and z cannot be equal.

Let me double-check my reasoning for each relation by considering concrete examples:

EC(x,z): Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle at the edge of x, and z as another circle that overlaps with y but only in the part where y touches x's boundary. In this case, x and z touch but don't overlap.

PO(x,z): Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle at the edge of x, and z as another circle that overlaps with y and extends both inside and outside of x. In this case, x and z partially overlap.

TPP(x,z): Wait, I need to reconsider this. If y is at the edge of x and overlaps with z, and x is properly contained in z, then a portion of y would also be outside of x (since y overlaps with z, which extends beyond x). But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which states that y is properly contained in x. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): Similarly, NTPP(x,z) would also imply that a portion of y is outside of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle at the edge of x, and z as an even smaller circle that overlaps with y and is completely contained within x, touching x's boundary. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x.

NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a circle, y as a smaller circle at the edge of x, and z as an even smaller circle that overlaps with y but is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

EQ(x,z): As I explained earlier, this is not possible due to the constraints.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let's revisit the definitions more clearly and think about this more systematically.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is properly contained within x (all of y is inside x, but y is not equal to x).
- y touches the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. This means:
- y and z share some common part.
- Neither y nor z is fully contained in the other.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

DC(x,z) - disconnected: If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is inside x) and z would also be disconnected. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) - externally connected: If x and z are externally connected, they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Given that y (which is inside x) and z partially overlap, y and z share interior parts. For EC(x,z) to be true, this overlap must be exactly at the boundary of x, which is possible since y touches the boundary of x.

PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is certainly possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z could overlap in the region where y and z overlap, and z could extend outside of x.

TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: For this to be true, all of x must be inside z, and x must touch the boundary of z. But if all of x is inside z, then all of y (which is inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z) because neither y nor z should be fully contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Similarly, this would imply all of y is inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible. z could be properly contained within x and touch the boundary of x, overlapping with y (which is at the edge of x) in the process.

NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is also possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, overlapping with y in the process.

EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: If x and z are equal, then PO(y,z) would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts TPPi(x,y) because TPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained in x, not partially overlapping with it. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I think I might still be making an error with EC(x,z). Let me think more carefully.

If EC(x,z), then x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But we know that y is inside x and y overlaps with z, meaning y and z share interior parts. Since y is inside x, those shared interior parts are also inside x, which means x and z must share interior parts. This contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider EC(x,z) once more. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y touches the boundary of x. If z overlaps with y only at the part where y touches the boundary of x, and doesn't extend inside x beyond this overlap, then x and z would touch at the boundary but not share interior parts. In this case, EC(x,z) would be true.

No, I'm being careless. PO(y,z) means y and z share interior parts. If y is inside x and y and z share interior parts, then x and z must also share interior parts, which rules out EC(x,z).

Actually, I think the key point of confusion is understanding the precise meaning of "interior" and "boundary" in these relations. Let me clarify this.

In topology, the interior of a set consists of all points that are surrounded by points in the set. The boundary consists of points where, if you go in any direction, you'll encounter both points inside and outside the set.

Now, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means all of y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some interior points, and both y and z have interior points that are not shared.

Now, if y touches the boundary of x and y overlaps with z, can x and z be externally connected (EC)? For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at a boundary but not share interior parts.

Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z share the parts where y and z overlap. If these parts are interior to both y and z, then they are also interior to x (since y is inside x), which means x and z share interior parts. This would rule out EC(x,z).

But I think I understand the confusion now. It's possible that TPPi(x,y) means y touches the boundary of x at a tangent point. However, that does not mean that y consists only of boundary points of x. The relation TPPi(x,y) ensures that there are interior points of y that are also interior points of x, since y is a tangential proper part of x.

Given that understanding, it's clear that EC(x,z) is not possible, because there are interior points of y that overlap with z, and these interior points of y are also interior points of x, meaning x and z share interior points.

Alright, so the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait, I think there's an ambiguity here. Depending on the exact definition of "Tangential Proper Part", I could interpret it in (at least) two ways:

1. Tangential Proper Part (TPP) means that the entire object a is inside object b, and touches the boundary of b at some point. Essentially: "a is inside b, with a touching b's rim."

2. Tangential Proper Part (TPP) means that the entire object a is inside object b, and touches the boundary of b at some point. Additionally, the boundaries of a and b meet and the interiors of a and b also meet. Essentially, "a's boundary touches b's boundary."

Let me use the clear definition from the RCC-8 calculus for TPP, and the understanding of the "tangential" part: TPP(a,b) means that a is a proper part of b (all of a is inside b, and a is not equal to b) and a and b share at least one boundary point (a touches the boundary of b at some point).

Given this definition, let's reconsider the relations between x and z.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. All of y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x at some point.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is inside x) and z would also be disconnected. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected, they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Given that y (which is inside x) and z partially overlap, they share interior parts. Since y is inside x, those shared interior parts are also inside x, which means x and z must share interior parts. This contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): This is definitely possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z could overlap in the region where y and z overlap, and z could extend outside of x.

TPP(x,z): For this to be true, all of x must be inside z, and x must touch the boundary of z. But if all of x is inside z, then all of y (which is inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z) because neither y nor z should be fully contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this would imply all of y is inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be properly contained within x and touch the boundary of x, overlapping with y in the process.

NTPPi(x,z): This is also possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, overlapping with y in the process.

EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then PO(y,z) would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts TPPi(x,y) because TPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained in x, not partially overlapping with it. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check if it's possible for z to be inside x without overlapping with y. If z is inside x but doesn't overlap with y, then PO(y,z) would be violated. So, z must overlap with y.

If z overlaps with y and is inside x, can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))? In other words, can z be inside x without touching the boundary of x?

Since y touches the boundary of x (because TPPi(x,y)), if z overlaps with y only in the interior of y (away from where y touches the boundary of x), then z could be inside x without touching the boundary of x. In this case, NTPPi(x,z) would be true.

Alternatively, if z overlaps with y and extends to touch the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) would be true.

If z overlaps with y and extends outside of x, then PO(x,z) would be true.

Given that y overlaps with z and y is inside x, z can't be disconnected from x (DC(x,z)). Additionally, z can't be externally connected to x (EC(x,z)) because if y and z overlap, and y is inside x, then x and z must also overlap. Similarly, x can't be a proper part of z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)) because this would mean all of y is inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). Lastly, x and z can't be equal (EQ(x,z)) because this would mean PO(y,z) = PO(y,x), which contradicts TPPi(x,y).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait a moment. Let me carefully examine these spatial relationships to make sure we get this right.

1. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), meaning y is a proper part of x (all of y is inside x, and y is not equal to x) and y touches the boundary of x at some point.

2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Let's consider the different possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

DC(x,z) - disconnected: If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any parts. But if y is inside x and y overlaps with z, then x and z must share parts (specifically, the parts where y and z overlap). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) - externally connected: If x and z are externally connected, they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Given that y (which is inside x) and z partially overlap, they share interior parts. Since y is inside x, those shared interior parts are also inside x, which means x and z must share interior parts. This contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is definitely possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z could overlap in the region where y and z overlap, and z could extend outside of x.

TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: For this to be true, all of x must be inside z, and x must touch the boundary of z. But if all of x is inside z, then all of y (which is inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z) because neither y nor z should be fully contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Similarly, this would imply all of y is inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible. z could be properly contained within x and touch the boundary of x, overlapping with y in the process.

NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is also possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, overlapping with y in the process.

EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: If x and z are equal, then PO(y,z) would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts TPPi(x,y) because TPPi(x,y) means y is properly contained in x, not partially overlapping with it. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check each of these:

PO(x,z): Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z could overlap in the region where y and z overlap, and z could extend outside of x. This is consistent with the given constraints.

TPPi(x,z): z could be properly contained within x and touch the boundary of x, overlapping with y in the process. This is consistent with the given constraints.

NTPPi(x,z): z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, overlapping with y in the process. This is consistent with the given constraints.

All other relations lead to contradictions with the given constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Just to be extra thorough, let me make sure I've considered all possibilities.

DC(x,z): Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share parts. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): If x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts, but y (which is inside x) and z share interior parts, then x and z must also share interior parts. This contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z could overlap in the region where y and z overlap, and z could extend outside of x.

TPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z, then all of y (which is inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this would imply all of y is inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be properly contained within x and touch the boundary of x, overlapping with y in the process.

NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, overlapping with y in the process.

EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then PO(y,z) would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me draw this out to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Consider three scenarios:

Scenario 1 (PO(x,z)):
x is a circle.
y is a smaller circle at the edge of x.
z is a circle that overlaps with y and extends outside of x.
In this case, x and z partially overlap, hence PO(x,z).

Scenario 2 (TPPi(x,z)):
x is a circle.
y is a smaller circle at the edge of x.
z is an even smaller circle that overlaps with y and is completely contained within x, touching the boundary of x.
In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, hence TPPi(x,z).

Scenario 3 (NTPPi(x,z)):
x is a circle.
y is a smaller circle at the edge of x.
z is an even smaller circle that overlaps with y but is completely contained within x without touching the boundary of x.
In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, hence NTPPi(x,z).

I believe these three scenarios exhaust all the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me also confirm the answer once more by considering the constraints:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

Given these constraints, the relation between x and z must be such that y (which is inside x) and z (which overlaps with y) interact in a way that satisfies both constraints.

If z is disconnected from x (DC(x,z)), then it's disconnected from y (which is inside x), contradicting PO(y,z).

If z is externally connected to x (EC(x,z)), it means z touches the boundary of x but doesn't share interior parts with x. But since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share interior parts, contradicting EC(x,z).

If x is a proper part of z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)), then y (which is inside x) is also inside z, contradicting PO(y,z) which states that neither y nor z is fully contained in the other.

If x and z are equal (EQ(x,z)), then the relation between y and z would be the same as the relation between y and x, which is TPPi. This contradicts PO(y,z).

The remaining possibilities are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, which is consistent with y being inside x and y overlapping with z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, which is consistent with z overlapping with y (which is inside x) and touching the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is consistent with z overlapping with y (which is inside x) without touching the boundary of x.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me really triple check each of the relationships by drawing a diagram. Actually, I already checked using diagrams, so the answer is still the same.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these given relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. All of y is inside x and y touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is contained in the other.

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Not possible because y is inside x and y overlaps with z, so x and z must share some parts.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Not possible because if y (inside x) overlaps with z, then x and z must share interior parts, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z can partially overlap where z extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is tangential proper part of z: Not possible because if all of x were inside z, then y (inside x) would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is non-tangential proper part of z: Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is tangential proper part of x: Possible. z can be completely inside x, overlap with y, and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is non-tangential proper part of x: Possible. z can be completely inside x, overlap with y, and not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: Not possible because if x=z, then the relation between y and z would be TPPi, not PO.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
