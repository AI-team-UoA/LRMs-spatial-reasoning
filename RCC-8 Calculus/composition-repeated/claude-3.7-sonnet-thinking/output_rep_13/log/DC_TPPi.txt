PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's go through the definitions:

1. DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So we know:
- x and y are disconnected
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary

Now, let's figure out the possible relationships between x and z:

1. **DC(x,z)**: Since x is disconnected from y, and z is completely within y (with possibly touching y's boundary), x must also be disconnected from z. This is a possible relationship.

2. **EC(x,z)**: Since z touches y's boundary, and x is outside of y, it's possible that x touches z at the point where z touches y's boundary. This is a possible relationship.

3. **PO(x,z)**: This would mean x and z share some interior points. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is completely within y, x cannot share any interior points with z. So this is not a possible relationship.

4. **TPP(x,z)**: This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is completely within y, x cannot be part of z. So this is not a possible relationship.

5. **NTPP(x,z)**: This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is completely within y, x cannot be part of z. So this is not a possible relationship.

6. **TPPi(x,z)**: This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since z is part of y, and x is disconnected from y, z cannot be part of x. So this is not a possible relationship.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)**: This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But since z is part of y, and x is disconnected from y, z cannot be part of x. So this is not a possible relationship.

8. **EQ(x,z)**: This would mean x and z are coincident. But since x is disconnected from y, and z is part of y, x and z cannot be coincident. So this is not a possible relationship.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning above. Let me reconsider the TPPi(y,z) relationship. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y. But I said that means "z is part of y and touches y's boundary". That's correct, but I need to be more precise. TPP(z,y) means that z is part of y, z touches y's boundary, and z is not equal to y. This means that z is a proper subset of y.

Let me redo the analysis:

1. **DC(x,z)**: Since x is disconnected from y, and z is completely within y (with possibly touching y's boundary), x must also be disconnected from z. This is a possible relationship.

2. **EC(x,z)**: Actually, this is a bit more complex. If x is disconnected from y, that means x does not even touch y at a boundary. Since z is completely within y (with possibly touching y's boundary), it's not immediate whether x can touch z. If z touches y's boundary at a point where x is adjacent to y, then x could touch z at that point. But it's also possible that z touches y's boundary at a point where x is not adjacent to y. So EC(x,z) is a possible relationship, but it's not guaranteed.

Actually, let me try to visualize this more carefully:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y

To better understand the constraints, let's imagine a concrete scenario. Let's say y is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at one point. x is completely outside of y, not even touching it.

Now, the question is: what can be the relationship between x and z?

1. **DC(x,z)**: If x is far enough from y, then x and z are disconnected. This is a possible relationship.

2. **EC(x,z)**: Ah, actually, it's not possible for x to touch z. Since x is disconnected from y, and z is completely within y (with possibly touching y's boundary), x cannot touch z. To touch z, x would have to touch y at the point where z touches y's boundary, but that would make x and y connected, contradicting DC(x,y). So EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Wait, I think I'm making another mistake. Let me be more careful:

- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is part of y, z touches y's boundary, and z is not equal to y.

Let's consider a concrete scenario again. Let's say y is a circle, z is a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at one point, and x is completely outside of y, not even touching it.

In this scenario, x and z are definitely disconnected, so DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Now, can x and z be externally connected (EC)? This would mean that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. For this to happen, x would have to touch z at the point where z touches y's boundary. But since x is disconnected from y, x cannot touch y at any point, including the point where z touches y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

I think DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, I'm not convinced of my reasoning. Let me try a different approach. 

Let's think about the constraint TPPi(y,z) more carefully. This means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is a proper subset of y and z touches y's boundary.

Consider a scenario where y is a circle, z is a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at one point, and x is completely outside of y, not even touching it.

In this scenario, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

But now, let's consider a slightly different scenario. Let's say y is a circle, z is a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at one point, and x is another circle that's disconnected from y but touches the same point on y's boundary that z touches from the inside.

In this scenario, x and z touch at a single point (the point where they both touch y's boundary), but they don't share any interior points. This would make the relationship between x and z externally connected (EC).

Wait, but this seems to contradict the constraint DC(x,y). If x touches y's boundary, then x and y are not disconnected; they are externally connected.

Let me go back to the definitions:

- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

If DC(x,y), then x and y do not touch at any point. They are completely separate.

If TPPi(y,z), then z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z touches y's boundary from the inside.

So, if x is completely separate from y, and z is inside y touching y's boundary, then x and z must be disconnected. The only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Actually, wait, I'm not sure I understand the EC relationship correctly. Let's be precise.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means the interiors of x and y are disjoint, but their boundaries intersect. 

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This means both the interiors and the boundaries of x and y are disjoint.

With TPPi(y,z), we know that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means the interior of z is a proper subset of the interior of y, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y.

Now, if DC(x,y), then both the interior and the boundary of x are disjoint from both the interior and the boundary of y. Since the boundary of z touches the boundary of y, and the boundary of x is disjoint from the boundary of y, the boundary of x must also be disjoint from the boundary of z. Similarly, since the interior of z is a subset of the interior of y, and the interior of x is disjoint from the interior of y, the interior of x must also be disjoint from the interior of z.

So, if both the interior and the boundary of x are disjoint from both the interior and the boundary of z, then the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

So the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Actually, wait I'm being too hasty. Let me try to draw out all possibilities first.

Start with TPPi(y,z), which means that z is a proper subset of y and it touches y's boundary. It looks like this:

```
+--------+
|    y   |
|   +-+  |
|   |z|  |
|   +-+  |
+--------+
```

But wait, z should touch y's boundary. So it's more like:

```
+--------+
|    y   |
|   +--+ |
|   |z | |
|   +--+ |
+--------+
```

where the right side of z's boundary touches the right side of y's boundary.

Now, given that DC(x,y), x is completely outside of y:

```
+--------+      +---+
|    y   |      | x |
|   +--+ |      |   |
|   |z | |      |   |
|   +--+ |      |   |
+--------+      +---+
```

And in this case, DC(x,z) is the relationship between x and z. x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

But wait, is it possible for EC(x,z) to hold? This would mean that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. For this to happen, x would have to touch z at a point. Given the constraints, this could only happen if x touches z at the point where z touches y's boundary.

But if x touches y's boundary, then DC(x,y) would not hold; instead, EC(x,y) would hold. So it's not possible for EC(x,z) to hold when DC(x,y) holds.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused because it's hard to think about these in 2D space as I've been doing above. Let me think about this in 1D space to simplify.

In 1D, a "region" is an interval. Two regions are disconnected (DC) if there's a gap between them. They are externally connected (EC) if they touch at a single point.

So, in 1D:
- DC(x,y) means that intervals x and y have a gap between them.
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a subinterval of y and one endpoint of z coincides with one endpoint of y.

Now, let's think about what's possible for the relationship between x and z.

Given that there's a gap between x and y, and z is within y with one endpoint coinciding with one endpoint of y, there must also be a gap between x and z. So, DC(x,z) is the relationship.

Let's try once more with 2D visualizations to be completely sure.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y

Let's start from TPPi(y,z). This means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary:

```
+---------------------+
|         y           |
|                     |
|      +-----+        |
|      |  z  |        |
|      +-----+        |
|                     |
+---------------------+
```

where the boundary of z touches the boundary of y at some point. 

Now, since DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, x is outside of y with a gap between them:

```
+---------------------+      +-----+
|         y           |      |  x  |
|                     |      |     |
|      +-----+        |      |     |
|      |  z  |        |      |     |
|      +-----+        |      |     |
|                     |      |     |
+---------------------+      +-----+
```

Given this configuration, x and z are also disconnected, so DC(x,z) is the relationship.

Now, let's consider another valid configuration for TPPi(y,z):

```
+---------------------+
|         y           |
|                     |
|      +-----+        |
|      |  z  |--------|
|      +-----+        |
|                     |
+---------------------+
```

where z touches the boundary of y on the right. 

Now, adding x such that DC(x,y) holds:

```
+---------------------+      +-----+
|         y           |      |  x  |
|                     |      |     |
|      +-----+        |      |     |
|      |  z  |--------|      |     |
|      +-----+        |      |     |
|                     |      |     |
+---------------------+      +-----+
```

Even if we move x to the right, as long as there's a gap between y and x, there's also a gap between z and x. So, DC(x,z) is the relationship.

I think the key insight is that if z is inside y and touches y's boundary at some point, and x is outside of y with a gap, then there's also a gap between x and z. So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let's try to make a counterexample. We want DC(x,y), TPPi(y,z), and we want x and z to be related in some way other than DC.

First, let's visualize TPPi(y,z) or equivalently TPP(z,y):

```
+---------------------+
|         y           |
|                     |
|      +-----+        |
|      |  z  |--------|
|      +-----+        |
|                     |
+---------------------+
```

z is inside y and touches y's boundary on the right.

Now, let's add x such that DC(x,y) holds, but perhaps EC(x,z) holds:

```
+---------------------+        +-----+
|         y           |        |  x  |
|                     |        |     |
|      +-----+        |        |     |
|      |  z  |--------|--------+     |
|      +-----+        |        |     |
|                     |        |     |
+---------------------+        +-----+
```

The issue with this is that if z touches y's boundary, and x touches z at the same point, then x also touches y's boundary. This would make EC(x,y), not DC(x,y).

I think the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Maybe let's try a little more carefully in 1D. So we have three intervals x, y, and z.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper subinterval of y, and an endpoint of z coincides with an endpoint of y. Given the 1D nature, this means one of the following two scenarios:

```
y: [--------------------]
z:   [----------]
```

or

```
y: [--------------------]
z:                   [--]
```

or

```
y: [--------------------]
z: [----------]
```

or

```
y: [--------------------]
z:               [------]
```

In the first two, z is a subinterval of y but doesn't touch y's boundary, which contradicts "tangential". So it's not TPPi.

In the latter two, z is a subinterval of y and touches y's boundary, which is what TPPi means.

Now, DC(x,y) means that intervals x and y don't overlap and don't touch:

```
y: [--------------------]
x:                          [------]
```

or

```
y:               [--------]
x: [------]
```

Given these configurations, what can be the relationship between x and z?

In the first case, if z touches the right boundary of y and x is to the right of y, then there's still a gap between z and x:

```
y: [--------------------]
z:               [------]
x:                          [------]
```

In the second case, if z touches the left boundary of y and x is to the left of y, then there's still a gap between z and x:

```
y:               [--------]
z:               [----]
x: [------]
```

In all valid configurations, x and z are disconnected.

I think the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

So in summary, the possible relationships between x and z is just:
- DC(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationship is possible between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts (not even at boundaries)
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (which means y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

Let's analyze what this means geometrically:
- If y is completely disconnected from x (not even touching)
- And z is properly contained within y (with z touching y's boundary)
- Then x must be completely disconnected from z as well

This is because:
- For x to have any connection with z, they would need to either share points or touch at a boundary
- But since z is entirely within y (except where it touches y's boundary)
- And x is completely separated from y (including y's boundary)
- There is no way for x to connect with z in any manner

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: DC(x,z)
