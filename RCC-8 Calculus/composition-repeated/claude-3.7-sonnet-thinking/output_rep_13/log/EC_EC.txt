PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
We also know that EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Now we need to determine what the possible relationships between x and z could be, given these constraints.

Let me consider each of the RCC-8 relations as possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible, because x could touch y at one side, and z could touch y at a different side, with no overlap between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary. This is possible because x and z could both touch y at the same boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible because x and z could both touch y at different points, but also overlap with each other partially.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x touches y at some boundary point, and z also touches y at the same boundary point, but x is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. I don't think this is possible given the constraints. If x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then x cannot touch y's boundary unless y also overlaps with z. But we know that EC(y,z), which means y and z only touch at their boundaries. So NTPP(x,z) is not compatible with the given constraints.

Actually, let me reconsider. If z is large enough, and y is small and touches z at a boundary point, it's still possible for x to be entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, while also touching y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) could be possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Similar to TPP(x,z), this is possible if z touches y at some boundary point, and x also touches y at the same boundary point, but z is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the NTPP case, this is possible if x is large enough, and y is small and touches x at a boundary point, while z is entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary, but touching y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region, both touching y at the same boundary point.

So, based on this analysis, all RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by drawing a simple diagram for each case.

1. DC(x,z): x touches y on the left, z touches y on the right, and x and z do not overlap. Possible.

2. EC(x,z): x touches y on the left, z touches y on the right, and x and z also touch each other at a boundary point. Possible.

3. PO(x,z): x touches y on the left, z touches y on the right, and x and z overlap partially. Possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and both x and z touch y's boundary. Possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let me try to see if there are any constraints imposed by the fact that both x and y touch at a boundary, and y and z touch at a boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then for x to touch y's boundary, y must penetrate into z to reach x. But that would mean y and z overlap, which contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then for z to touch y's boundary, y must penetrate into x to reach z. But that would contradict EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider all possibilities more carefully:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x and y touch at one boundary point, y and z touch at another boundary point, and x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x, y, and z all touch at a common boundary point, and x and z do not overlap.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x touches y at one point, z touches y at another point, and x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. For x to also touch y's boundary, and for y to touch z's boundary without overlapping with z, x must touch z's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): As I mentioned earlier, this is not possible. If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then for x to touch y's boundary, y must overlap with z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Similar to TPP(x,z), this is possible. z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. For z to also touch y's boundary, and for y to touch x's boundary without overlapping with x, z must touch x's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): As I mentioned earlier, this is not possible. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then for z to touch y's boundary, y must overlap with x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. For both x and z to touch y's boundary without overlapping with y, they must touch y at the same boundary point. This is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me check my reasoning for NTPP(x,z) once more. 

NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. We also know that EC(x,y), which means x touches y at a boundary point but does not overlap with y. And EC(y,z), which means y touches z at a boundary point but does not overlap with z.

For x to touch y's boundary, and for y to touch z's boundary without overlapping with z, y must touch z's boundary at a point. If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, how can x touch y's boundary without y overlapping with z? The only way would be if y penetrates into z to reach x, but that would mean y and z overlap, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to touch y's boundary, and for y to touch x's boundary without overlapping with x, y must penetrate into x to reach z, which contradicts EC(x,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I'm still not convinced about all of these. Let me think more carefully about TPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. We also know that EC(x,y), which means x touches y at a boundary point but does not overlap with y. And EC(y,z), which means y touches z at a boundary point but does not overlap with z.

For x to touch y's boundary, and for y to touch z's boundary without overlapping with z, both x and y must touch z's boundary at the same point. But for x to be completely contained within z, x must be smaller than z. If x is smaller than z and touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches z, then x would be touching y not just at a boundary point, but possibly overlapping with y, which contradicts EC(x,y).

So, TPP(x,z) might not be possible.

Similar concerns apply to TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be more careful. Maybe there is a configuration where TPP(x,z) is possible.

Let's consider a scenario where z is a circle, and x is a smaller circle touching z's boundary from the inside at a point p. Now, y could be another circle touching z's boundary from the outside at the same point p. In this scenario, x, y, and z all touch at a common point p, but x is a tangential proper part of z, y is externally connected to both x and z, and x and z do not overlap with y.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), x would be a larger circle, z would be a smaller circle touching x's boundary from the inside at a point p, and y would be another circle touching x's boundary from the outside at the same point p.

So, TPPi(x,z) is also possible.

What about EQ(x,z)? This means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are stating the same relationship. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

Let me summarize the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z): DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I want to check one more time, specifically for TPP and TPPi.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and also EC(x,y), then y must touch x at the boundary point where x touches z's boundary. But we also know EC(y,z), which means y touches z at a boundary point but does not overlap with z. So, y must touch both x and z at the same boundary point.

But wait, if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If y touches x at this boundary point, and y also touches z at this boundary point without overlapping with z, then y must be touching both x and z from the outside. This creates a scenario where all three regions touch at a common point, with x inside z and both touching y from the outside. This seems geometrically possible.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y touches z at this boundary point, and y also touches x at this boundary point without overlapping with x, then y must be touching both z and x from the outside. This creates a similar scenario to the one described above, but with z inside x. This also seems geometrically possible.

So, TPPi(x,z) is also possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I'm still a bit uncertain about TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z). Let me try a different approach.

Imagine we're in a two-dimensional space. 

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions, both touching y at different points.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not overlap. This is possible if x and z are separate regions that touch at a boundary point, and both also touch y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z overlap partially, and both also touch y at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary at least at one point. For EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at a boundary point. For EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at a boundary point but not overlap with z. These can all be satisfied if y touches both x and z at the same boundary point, where x also touches z's boundary from the inside.

Let's consider a concrete example: z is a circle, x is a smaller circle touching z's boundary from the inside at a point p, and y is another region that touches both x and z at the point p from the outside. In this scenario, EC(x,y) holds because x and y touch at p but do not overlap. EC(y,z) holds because y and z touch at p but do not overlap. And TPP(x,z) holds because x is a tangential proper part of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary. For EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at a boundary point. For EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at a boundary point but not overlap with z. But if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, y would have to penetrate into z to touch x, which would mean y overlaps with z, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of TPP(x,z), and by a similar argument, it is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of NTPP(x,z), and by a similar argument, it is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are describing the same relationship. This is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me just check the case where y does not touch z's boundary at the same point where x touches z's boundary. I believe this would give TPP(x,z) too.

Let's imagine a scenario where:
- z is a circle,
- x is a smaller circle touching z's boundary from the inside at a point p1,
- y is another region touching x at a different boundary point p2, and also touching z at a third boundary point p3.

In this scenario, EC(x,y) holds because x and y touch at p2 but do not overlap. EC(y,z) holds because y and z touch at p3 but do not overlap. And TPP(x,z) holds because x is a tangential proper part of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is still possible.

Oh, I see an issue in this second scenario. If x is entirely within z, then any point on x's boundary is either inside z or on z's boundary. If p2 is on x's boundary and also on y's boundary (i.e., EC(x,y) holds), then y must overlap with z if p2 is inside z. So we need p2 to be on z's boundary, which means p2 = p1. This contradicts my statement above where p1, p2, and p3 are all different points.

So, I believe the only way TPP(x,z) is possible is if x touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches both x and z.

OK, so I'm back to my original conclusion, still:
The possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me be more careful about TPP(x,z). If x is a tangential proper part of z, then the boundary of x touches the boundary of z at some point p. If y touches both x and z at this same point p (from the outside), then we have EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). So this configuration is possible.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), if z is a tangential proper part of x, then the boundary of z touches the boundary of x at some point p. If y touches both z and x at this same point p (from the outside), then we have EC(y,z) and EC(x,y). So this configuration is also possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, then they have the same boundary. If y touches this boundary at some point p, then we have both EC(y,x) and EC(y,z). So this configuration is possible.

For DC(x,z), x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions, both touching y at different points.

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at a boundary but do not overlap. This is possible if x and z are separate regions that touch at a boundary point, and both also touch y.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z overlap partially, and both also touch y at their boundaries.

So the possible relationships are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

I think this makes sense. However, let me just double check again for these cases. We want to figure out the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). Let's consider each potential relationship for x and z:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not overlap.
PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not overlap.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not overlap.

Let's check each potential relationship for x and z to see if it's compatible with the given constraints:

DC(x,z):
- Imagine x and z as two separate circles, and y as a dumbbell shape that touches x at one end and z at the other.
- This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and DC(x,z).
- So DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

EC(x,z):
- Imagine x and z as two separate circles touching at a point, and y as a third circle touching both x and z at the same point.
- This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z).
- So EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

PO(x,z):
- Imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, and y as a third circle touching the boundary of both x and z at points where x and z do not overlap.
- This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).
- So PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

TPP(x,z):
- Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary at a point, and y as a third circle touching both x and z at that same point.
- This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).
- So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

NTPP(x,z):
- If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then for EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at x's boundary. But for EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at z's boundary without overlapping with z. This would mean y penetrates into z to reach x, which contradicts EC(y,z).
- So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

TPPi(x,z):
- This is the inverse of TPP(x,z), and by a similar argument, it is a possible relationship.

NTPPi(x,z):
- This is the inverse of NTPP(x,z), and by a similar argument, it is not a possible relationship.

EQ(x,z):
- If x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are describing the same relationship, which is consistent.
- So EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

So, the answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

I'll analyze each potential relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x and z can be disconnected, with y touching both at different boundary points.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries without overlapping, with y also touching both at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y touching both at boundary points where they don't overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z touching z's boundary, with y touching both x and z at that same boundary point.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would need to overlap with z to touch x, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x touching x's boundary, with y touching both x and z at that same boundary point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would need to overlap with x to touch z, contradicting EC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. If x and z are identical, then y can touch both at the same boundary point.
