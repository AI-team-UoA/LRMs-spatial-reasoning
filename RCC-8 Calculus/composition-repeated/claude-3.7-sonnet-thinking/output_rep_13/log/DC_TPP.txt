PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the relationships we know:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, so they share no spatial parts.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now we need to figure out what relationships are possible between x and z.

Let's go through each of the 8 RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
This is possible. If x is disconnected from y, and y is a part of z, then x could still be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, it could still touch the boundary of z in areas where y doesn't exist.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
This is possible. Even though x doesn't overlap with y, it could overlap with parts of z that are not part of y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, it could still be a tangential proper part of z, contained in parts of z that are not y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, it could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, in parts of z that are not y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
This is not possible. If z contains y as a proper part, and y is disconnected from x, then z cannot be a proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
This is not possible. If x and y are disconnected, and y is part of z, then x and z cannot be equal.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

So y is completely inside z but touches z's boundary. And x is completely separated from y.

Now, can x be equal to z? No, because if x were equal to z, then y would be a tangential proper part of x, which would mean y would have to share some space with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

Can z be a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi)? No, because if z were inside x, then y would also be inside x (since y is inside z), which would contradict DC(x,y).

Can x overlap with z (PO)? Yes, x can overlap with parts of z that don't include y.

Can x be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP)? Yes, x can be inside z as long as it doesn't overlap with y.

Can x externally connect with z (EC)? Yes, x can touch the boundary of z without overlapping with y.

Can x be disconnected from z (DC)? Yes, x can be completely outside of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Wait, let me double-check TPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), is this possible? 

If y touches the boundary of z (since TPP(y,z)), and x touches the boundary of z (hypothetically, if TPP(x,z)), then it's possible for x and y to be disconnected if they touch different parts of z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is also possible while maintaining DC(x,y).

So my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x can be completely outside z while y is inside z.
2. EC(x,z): x can touch z's boundary without overlapping with y.
3. PO(x,z): x can partially overlap with z in regions that don't contain y.
4. TPP(x,z): x can be inside z touching z's boundary, separate from y.
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be completely inside z without touching its boundary, separate from y.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible - if z contains y, and x is disconnected from y, then z cannot be inside x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - for same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x equals z, then y would be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).
