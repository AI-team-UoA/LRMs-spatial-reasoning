PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully think through the possible relationships between x and z based on the given information: EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

EC(x,y) means that x and y are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Now, let's consider what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
   This is possible. x touches only the boundary of y, and z overlaps with y, but it's possible that z doesn't extend to the boundary where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: 
   This is possible. If z extends to the boundary of y where x touches y, then x and z could touch at a point or along a boundary without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: 
   This is possible. If z extends beyond the boundary of y in a way that it overlaps with x, then x and z could partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: 
   This seems unlikely because x is only touching y at the boundary, not contained within it. For x to be a tangential proper part of z, z would need to contain x and have a boundary that x touches, which doesn't seem to follow from the given relations.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: 
   This seems impossible because x is only touching y at the boundary, not contained within it. For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, z would need to completely contain x including its boundary, which doesn't seem possible given the constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: 
   This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z overlaps with y which only touches x at the boundary, it seems possible that part of z extends into x, touching x's boundary from the inside.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: 
   This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z overlaps with y which only touches x at the boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be completely contained within x without touching its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: 
   This seems impossible because z overlaps with y, while x only touches y at the boundary. If x and z were equal, they would have the same relationship with y, which is not the case.

Let me check my reasoning again...

Actually, I think I need to reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). 

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. If z overlaps with y and extends beyond it to completely contain x, and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. If z overlaps with y and extends beyond it to completely contain x, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Let me rethink TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) as well.

For TPPi(x,z), we need z to be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Given that z overlaps with y and y only touches x at the boundary, it's hard to see how z could be contained within x. If z is partially overlapping with y, then part of z is in y, and y is outside of x (except at the boundary). So z can't be completely within x.

For NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. Again, if z overlaps with y and y is outside of x (except at the boundary), then z can't be completely within x.

Wait, I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me be more careful.

Given: 
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

Let's think about the possible configurations:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
   Yes, this is possible. x touches only the boundary of y, and z overlaps with y, but it's possible that z doesn't extend to the boundary where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: 
   Yes, this is possible. If z extends to the boundary of y where x touches y, then x and z could touch at a point or along a boundary without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: 
   Yes, this is possible. If z extends beyond the boundary of y in a way that it overlaps with x, then x and z could partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: 
   For this, x would need to be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z. Given that x is externally connected to y, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z at the same point where x touches y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: 
   For this, x would need to be completely inside z and not touch the boundary of z. Given that x is externally connected to y, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible for x to be completely inside z and not touch the boundary of z, especially if z extends well beyond y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: 
   For this, z would need to be completely inside x and touch the boundary of x. Given that z partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to x, it's hard to see how z could be completely inside x. If z is partially inside y, and y is outside of x (except at the boundary), then z can't be completely within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: 
   For this, z would need to be completely inside x and not touch the boundary of x. Again, if z partially overlaps with y, and y is outside of x (except at the boundary), then z can't be completely within x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: 
   For this, x and z would need to be identical. But x is externally connected to y, while z partially overlaps with y. These are different relationships, so x and z can't be equal.

Actually, I'm not sure about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) anymore. Let me rethink them.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Given that x is externally connected to y, which means x touches y's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, it seems like it could be possible for x to be contained within z and touch z's boundary. For instance, if z contains most of y and extends beyond it to include x, but the boundary of z coincides with the boundary of x at some point.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. Given that x is externally connected to y, which means x touches y's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, it seems like it could be possible for x to be contained within z and not touch z's boundary. For instance, if z contains all of x and the part of y that x touches, and extends even further.

OK, let me be more explicit. Let's think of specific examples for each potential relation.

Let's represent regions as sets of points in a plane.

EC(x,y): x and y touch at a point or along a boundary but don't share interior points.
PO(y,z): y and z share some points, but neither is completely contained in the other.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   Example: x is a circle on the left, y is a circle in the middle, and z is a circle on the right. x touches y at a point, y and z overlap, but x and z are completely separate.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   Example: x is a circle on the left, y is a circle in the middle, and z is a circle that overlaps with y and extends to touch x at a point.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   Example: x is a circle on the left, y is a circle in the middle, and z is a circle that overlaps with y and extends to overlap with part of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   For this, x would need to be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z. Given that x is externally connected to y, and y partially overlaps with z, I think this is possible if z is a large circle that contains both x and y, and the boundary of z coincides with the boundary of x at some point. But wait, if x is touching y, and y is partially outside of z, then how can x be completely inside z? Actually, this seems challenging to satisfy.

   Let me try again. What if z is a large region that contains all of x except for the point where x touches y, and z also contains part of y? Then x would be a tangential proper part of z. But wait, if x touches y at a point, and y partially overlaps with z, then that point of contact between x and y must be either inside z or outside z. If it's inside z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z. If it's outside z, then x isn't completely contained in z.

   Hmm, I'm having a hard time visualizing a scenario where TPP(x,z) is satisfied given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

   Let me try a different approach. What if y is a large region, and x is a small circle that touches the boundary of y at a point. Then z is a region that overlaps with a part of y and also contains all of x, with the boundary of z touching the boundary of x at a point (which could be the same point where x touches y). That seems to satisfy TPP(x,z), EC(x,y), and PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   For this, x would need to be completely inside z and not touch the boundary of z. Given that x is externally connected to y, and y partially overlaps with z, I think this is possible if z is a large circle that contains both x and the part of y that x touches, and the boundary of z is far from x. But wait, if x is touching y, and y is partially outside of z, then how can x be completely inside z without touching the boundary of z?

   Similar to the TPP case, I'm having a hard time visualizing a scenario where NTPP(x,z) is satisfied.

   Let me try a different approach. What if y is a large region, and x is a small circle that touches the boundary of y at a point. Then z is a region that overlaps with a part of y and also contains all of x, with the boundary of z not touching x. That seems to satisfy NTPP(x,z), EC(x,y), and PO(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   For this, z would need to be completely inside x and touch the boundary of x. Given that z partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to x, it's hard to see how z could be completely inside x. If z is partially inside y, and y is outside of x (except at the boundary), then z would need to be completely inside x, which seems impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   For this, z would need to be completely inside x and not touch the boundary of x. Again, if z partially overlaps with y, and y is outside of x (except at the boundary), then z would need to be completely inside x, which seems impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   For this, x and z would need to be identical. But x is externally connected to y, while z partially overlaps with y. These are different relationships, so x and z can't be equal.

Actually, looking at TPP and NTPP more carefully, I think they are indeed possible.

For TPP(x,z), imagine x is a small circle, y is a large circle, and they touch at a point. Now, z is another large circle that overlaps significantly with y and also contains all of x, with the boundary of z touching the boundary of x at the same point where x touches y.

For NTPP(x,z), imagine the same scenario, but now z is even larger, so the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

OK, let me try once more with a different scenario to visualize TPP and NTPP:

Imagine a configuration where:
- x is a small circle.
- y is a ring-shaped region (like a donut).
- x touches the outer boundary of y (so EC(x,y)).
- z is a large region that overlaps with part of y (so PO(y,z)).

For TPP(x,z): If z contains all of x and the part of y that x touches, but the boundary of z coincides with the boundary of x at some point (which could be the same point where x touches y), then x is a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z): If z contains all of x and the part of y that x touches, and the boundary of z is far from x, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Alright, having thought about this in more detail, I believe the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

I don't think TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) are possible given the constraints.

Let me double-check this once more...

Actually, I'm not completely convinced about NTPP(x,z). Let's think about it once more.

For NTPP(x,z), x needs to be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. Given that x is externally connected to y, x touches y's boundary. If z overlaps with y, and we want x to be inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must contain the part of y's boundary that x touches, and more. But is this possible given that z only partially overlaps with y? I think it is. If z contains all of x and extends into y to include the part where x touches y, but doesn't contain all of y, then we still have PO(y,z). And x is inside z without touching z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z).

So, I maintain that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Let me make sure once more that TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible:

For TPPi(x,z), z would need to be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Given that z partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to x, it's hard to see how z could be completely inside x. If z is partially inside y, and y is outside of x (except at the boundary), then z would extend outside of x, making TPPi(x,z) impossible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would need to be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. Again, if z partially overlaps with y, and y is outside of x (except at the boundary), then z would extend outside of x, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would need to be identical. But x is externally connected to y, while z partially overlaps with y. These are different relationships, so x and z can't be equal.

So, I believe the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

And the impossible relationships are:
6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal

To double-check, let me come up with specific 2D examples for the relations I believe are possible:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   Let x be a small circle on the left, y be a large circle in the middle, and z be a small circle on the right. x touches the boundary of y (EC(x,y)), and z overlaps with part of y but doesn't extend to the left where x is (PO(y,z)). In this scenario, x and z don't touch or overlap (DC(x,z)).

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   Let x be a small circle on the left, y be a large circle in the middle, and z be a shape that overlaps with part of y and extends to touch x at a point. Here, x touches the boundary of y (EC(x,y)), z overlaps with part of y (PO(y,z)), and x and z touch at a point (EC(x,z)).

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   Let x be a circle on the left, y be a large circle in the middle, and z be a shape that overlaps with part of y and extends to overlap with part of x. Here, x touches the boundary of y (EC(x,y)), z overlaps with part of y (PO(y,z)), and x and z overlap partially (PO(x,z)).

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   Let x be a small circle that touches the boundary of y. Let z be a shape that contains all of x and also overlaps with part of y, with the boundary of z touching the boundary of x at the same point where x touches y. In this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   Let x be a small circle that touches the boundary of y. Let z be a shape that contains all of x and also overlaps with part of y, including the part where x touches y. If the boundary of z doesn't touch x, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

OK, I think the 5 possibilities I've identified are correct: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

So in summary, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me review what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some interior, but neither is contained in the other)

Analyzing the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Possible. x touches only y's boundary, and z overlaps with y, but z might not extend to where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Possible. If z extends to the boundary of y where x touches y, then x and z could touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Possible. z could overlap with y and extend to overlap with part of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Possible. x could be completely contained in z while touching z's boundary (at the same point where x touches y).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Possible. x could be completely contained in the interior of z if z encompasses both x and the portion of y's boundary that x touches.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Not possible. Since z partially overlaps with y, and y is only externally connected to x, z cannot be contained within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Not possible. For the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible. x and z have different relationships with y (EC vs PO), so they cannot be identical.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
