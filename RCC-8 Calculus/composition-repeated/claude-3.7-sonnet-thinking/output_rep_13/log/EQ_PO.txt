PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step-by-step. 

We have:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.
- PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

Now, if x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), that means x and y are essentially the same spatial region. So whatever spatial relation y has with z, x should have the same relation with z.

Given that PO(y,z), and since x and y are coincident, we can conclude that PO(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Let me double-check this by thinking about the properties of these relations.

EQ(x,y) means that x and y occupy exactly the same space.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

If x and y occupy the same space, and y partially overlaps with z, then x should also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way.

So, the answer is: PO(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more careful here. The RCC-8 relations are pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive, meaning that for any two spatial regions, exactly one of the RCC-8 relations holds between them.

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical in terms of spatial extent.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.

Given that x and y are identical, and y partially overlaps with z, x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way. So, PO(x,z) must hold.

So, the answer is: PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what follows from the given relations.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other)

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are spatially identical, any spatial relation that y has with another region must be the same relation that x has with that region.

Therefore, if PO(y,z), then x must have the same relation with z as y does.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
