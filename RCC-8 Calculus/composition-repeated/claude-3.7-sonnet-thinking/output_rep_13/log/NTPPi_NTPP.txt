PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is properly contained within x, not touching x's boundary
- z properly contains y, and y doesn't touch z's boundary

Now we need to determine what relationship could hold between x and z. Let's go through the possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because x and z both contain y, so they must share at least that part.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch only at their boundaries. This is not possible because y is properly contained in both x and z, so they must overlap in their interiors.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x contains y, and z contains y, but there could be parts of x not in z and parts of z not in x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. This is possible. x could be properly contained in z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be properly contained in z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. This is possible. z could be properly contained in x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z could be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is not possible because y is a proper part of both x and z, so x and z cannot be equal.

Let's analyze this more carefully, considering the transitive relations.

Given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we know:
- y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Let's visualize this: y is inside both x and z, not touching either boundary. 

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z? Since y is contained within both x and z, x and z must at least share y. So DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are ruled out.

Let's think about each remaining possibility:

PO(x,z): This is possible if x extends beyond z in some parts, and z extends beyond x in other parts.

TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

TPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

EQ(x,z): Initially I ruled this out, but let's reconsider. If x and z are exactly the same, then y would be a proper part of both. This seems possible.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully:

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
If NTPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

I need to be more careful about the possible configurations:

1. x could be a part of z (TPP or NTPP)
2. z could be a part of x (TPPi or NTPPi)
3. x and z could partially overlap (PO)
4. x and z could be equal (EQ)

Let's think about each case more systematically:

Case 1: x is a part of z (TPP or NTPP)
If x is contained within z, and y is contained within x (since NTPPi(x,y) means y is contained in x), then y is also contained within z. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are both possible.

Case 2: z is a part of x (TPPi or NTPPi)
If z is contained within x, and y is contained within z (from NTPP(y,z)), then y is also contained within x. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are both possible.

Case 3: x and z partially overlap (PO)
If x and z partially overlap, then there's a region common to both. If y is in this common region (i.e., y is contained in both x and z), then we have both NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So PO(x,z) is possible.

Case 4: x and z are equal (EQ)
If x and z are equal, then y is a proper part of both x and z. This satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is possible.

I need to think a bit more about these cases, as I'm still not fully convinced.

For case 1 (x is a part of z), I know that y is properly contained in x (not touching x's boundary), and y is also properly contained in z (not touching z's boundary). If x is tangentially properly contained in z (TPP(x,z)), then x touches z's boundary. But since y doesn't touch x's boundary, it doesn't touch z's boundary either. This is consistent. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

If x is non-tangentially properly contained in z (NTPP(x,z)), then x doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, it certainly doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For case 2 (z is a part of x), I know that y is properly contained in both x and z. If z is tangentially properly contained in x (TPPi(x,z)), then z touches x's boundary. But this doesn't tell us whether y touches x's boundary. Since NTPPi(x,y) tells us that y doesn't touch x's boundary, y must be fully contained within z and not touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

If z is non-tangentially properly contained in x (NTPPi(x,z)), then z doesn't touch x's boundary. Since y is contained in z, and z doesn't touch x's boundary, y certainly doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For case 3 (x and z partially overlap), I know that y is properly contained in both x and z. If x and z partially overlap, then there's a region common to both, and regions unique to each. If y is in the common region and doesn't touch either boundary, then both NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For case 4 (x and z are equal), I initially thought this was possible, but let me reconsider. If x and z are equal, then for any point in x, it's also in z, and vice versa. Now, NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x, so y is strictly contained within x. Similarly, NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z, so y is strictly contained within z. This is consistent with x and z being equal. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me rethink this.

I know:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, not touching x's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.

Let's consider the relationships more carefully:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is part of both x and z, they must overlap. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since y is part of both x and z, they must overlap in their interiors. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if y is in the overlapping region, and both x and z extend beyond this region.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is a proper part of z, y is also a proper part of x. Since NTPP(y,z) means y doesn't touch z's boundary, and TPPi(x,z) means z touches x's boundary, y doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is a proper part of z, y is also a proper part of x. Since z doesn't touch x's boundary, y (being inside z) doesn't touch x's boundary either. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, then the statements "y is a proper part of x" and "y is a proper part of z" are equivalent. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), the statements are consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

I think all of TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), PO(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are possible, but let me think about this in a different way. Let me try to create concrete examples for each relation.

Example for PO(x,z):
Imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, with y as a smaller circle contained within the overlapping region. If y is positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of either x or z, then we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Example for TPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle contained within z and touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained within x but not touching x's boundary. Here, y is not touching z's boundary either. So we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Example for NTPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle contained within z and not touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained within x but not touching x's boundary. Here, y is not touching z's boundary either. So we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Example for TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle contained within x and touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained within z but not touching z's boundary. Here, y is not touching x's boundary either. So we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Example for NTPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle contained within x and not touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained within z but not touching z's boundary. Here, y is not touching x's boundary either. So we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Example for EQ(x,z):
Imagine x and z as the same circle, and y as a smaller circle contained within both x and z but not touching their boundaries. Here, we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

So it seems all these relations are possible. To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me think this through again to make sure.

I know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, not touching x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then there's no common part between them. But we know y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must have a common part. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, then they don't share any interior points. But we know y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then there's a region common to both, and regions unique to each. If y is contained within the common region, then both NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) can be satisfied. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Since y is contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, y is also contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, y is also contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then the statements "y is a proper part of x" and "y is a proper part of z" are equivalent. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), the statements are consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

I've double-checked my reasoning and I believe these are the correct possibilities.

Actually, I'm not 100% sure about my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z), so let me reconsider:

For TPP(x,z):
If x is tangentially contained in z, then x touches z's boundary. And if y is contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y is not going to touch z's boundary either. So NTPP(y,z) is satisfied. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is tangentially contained in x, then z touches x's boundary. But this doesn't tell us whether y touches x's boundary; it only tells us that y is contained in z. We know from NTPPi(x,y) that y doesn't touch x's boundary, and from NTPP(y,z) that y doesn't touch z's boundary. Since z touches x's boundary, and y is contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary, y is certainly not going to touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,y) is satisfied. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

I think my reasoning is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I realize that I needed to be careful in checking TPPi(x,z) because there's a subtlety: z touches x's boundary, so we need to make sure that y, being inside z, doesn't also touch x's boundary. But since NTPP(y,z) tells us that y doesn't touch z's boundary, and TPPi(x,z) tells us that z touches x's boundary, we can deduce that y doesn't touch x's boundary. So the condition NTPPi(x,y) is satisfied.

Let me now go through a final check by creating examples for each possible relationship:

1. PO(x,z): Consider x and z as two overlapping circles, with y as a smaller circle contained within the overlapping region. If y is positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of either x or z, then we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

2. TPP(x,z): Consider z as a larger circle, x as a smaller circle contained within z and touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained within x but not touching x's boundary. Here, y doesn't touch z's boundary either. So we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

3. NTPP(x,z): Consider z as a larger circle, x as a smaller circle contained within z but not touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained within x but not touching x's boundary. Here, y doesn't touch z's boundary either. So we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

4. TPPi(x,z): Consider x as a larger circle, z as a smaller circle contained within x and touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained within z but not touching z's boundary. Here, y doesn't touch x's boundary either. So we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

5. NTPPi(x,z): Consider x as a larger circle, z as a smaller circle contained within x but not touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle contained within z but not touching z's boundary. Here, y doesn't touch x's boundary either. So we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

6. EQ(x,z): Consider x and z as the same circle, and y as a smaller circle contained within both x and z but not touching their boundaries. Here, we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

All of these examples are consistent with the constraints. So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

That's the complete list.

Hmm, I'm not fully convinced. Let me get a better understanding of the problem by considering the logical meaning of each relation. For simplicity, I'll use "interior" to mean the non-boundary part of a region.

Let me reformulate the constraints:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly contained in x, and y's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is properly contained in z, and y's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Here's a more systematic approach:

First, since y is contained in both x and z, we know x and z must overlap, ruling out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Next, we have these cases to consider:
- x is properly contained in z
- z is properly contained in x
- x and z partially overlap
- x and z are equal

If x is properly contained in z, then we need to determine if x touches z's boundary. We know y is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So y is also properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). Whether x touches z's boundary or not, the constraint NTPP(y,z) is satisfied. So both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible.

If z is properly contained in x, then we need to determine if z touches x's boundary. We know y is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So y is also properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). Whether z touches x's boundary or not, the constraint NTPPi(x,y) is satisfied. So both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

If x and z partially overlap, then there's a region common to both, and regions unique to each. If y is contained in the common region and doesn't touch the boundaries of either x or z, then both NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied. So PO(x,z) is possible.

If x and z are equal, then for any point in x, it's also in z, and vice versa. Since y is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

This is consistent with my previous analysis. These are the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

So my final answer is:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what's possible when y is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x non-tangentially properly contains y.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is properly contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary

First, I can rule out:
- DC(x,z): impossible because y is contained in both x and z, so they must share at least this region
- EC(x,z): impossible because x and z must share interior points (specifically y)

Now, let me examine the remaining possibilities:

1. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap with y in their common region

2. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be properly contained in z while touching z's boundary, with y inside x not touching either boundary

3. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be properly contained in z without touching z's boundary

4. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be properly contained in x while touching x's boundary, with y inside z not touching either boundary

5. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary

6. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be the same region, with y properly contained within both

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
