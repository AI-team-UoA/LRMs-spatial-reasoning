PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, let's think through this step by step:

1. We have PO(x,y), which means x and y partially overlap; they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. We have NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is entirely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's consider what these conditions tell us about the relationship between x and z.

Since PO(x,y), we know that x partially overlaps with y. Since NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y), we know that z is entirely contained within y and away from the boundary. 

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since x partially overlaps with y, and z is completely inside y, there are a few possibilities:

1. x and z might be disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z). This would happen if x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't contain z.
2. x and z might touch at the boundary, i.e., EC(x,z). This would happen if x touches z at its boundary, and z is completely inside y.
3. x and z might partially overlap, i.e., PO(x,z). This would happen if x overlaps with a part of y that contains a part of z, but not all of z.
4. x might be a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(x,z). This would happen if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.
5. x might be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z). This would happen if x is entirely contained within z and away from z's boundary.
6. z might be a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x). This would happen if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
7. z might be a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x). This would happen if z is entirely contained within x and away from x's boundary.
8. x and z might be coincident, i.e., EQ(x,z). This would happen if x and z are exactly the same.

But wait, not all of these possibilities are consistent with the given conditions.

Let's reconsider:

1. We know that z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(z,y)).
2. We also know that x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), which means x is partly inside y and partly outside y.

Given these, let's check which of the above relationships between x and z are possible:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that's inside y doesn't overlap with z.
2. EC(x,z): This is trickier. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(z,y)), and x is partly outside y, for x to touch z at the boundary, the part of x inside y would have to touch z's boundary. This is possible.
3. PO(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that's inside y partially overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely inside z, but this contradicts PO(x,y) because if x is entirely inside z and z is entirely inside y, then x would be entirely inside y, not partially overlapping with y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP(x,z), this contradicts PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This would mean z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if the part of x inside y completely contains z and z touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if the part of x inside y completely contains z and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are exactly the same, but this contradicts PO(x,y) because if x is equal to z and z is entirely inside y, then x would be entirely inside y, not partially overlapping with y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait. Let me carefully reexamine TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). I said these aren't possible because they contradict PO(x,y), but let me be more precise. I'm thinking of a Venn diagram-like situation. The issue is, if x is contained within z, and z is contained within y, then x is contained within y, which contradicts PO(x,y).

Let's similarly reexamine TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). I said these are possible, but let me check again. If z is contained within x, and z is contained within y, then x and y must have a non-empty intersection (specifically, they share at least z), but this doesn't contradict PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are indeed possible.

Actually, let me go back to EC(x,z) too. I said it's possible, but upon further reflection, it's not. Here's why: If z doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(z,y)), and x is partly outside y (PO(x,y)), then for x to touch z at the boundary, the part of x inside y would have to touch z's boundary. But if z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, then the part of x inside y cannot touch z's boundary from the outside (since z is not at the boundary of y). The only way the part of x inside y could touch z's boundary is if that part of x was inside z, which would contradict EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Now, I think I need to be more systematic. Let's try to imagine the situation: y is a region, z is a region completely contained within y and not touching the boundary of y, and x is a region that partially overlaps with y.

Given these, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that's inside y doesn't overlap with z.
2. EC(x,z): After reconsideration, I think this is not possible. If z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, and x is partly outside y, then for x to touch z at the boundary, the part of x inside y would have to reach inside y to touch z's boundary. But if x and z are touching at their boundaries, then they cannot have overlapping interiors (by definition of EC). So the part of x inside y cannot be inside z. But then, how can it touch z's boundary? It can't do so from the outside because z is not at the boundary of y. So EC(x,z) is not possible.
3. PO(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that's inside y partially overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would have to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. But if x is entirely inside z, and z is entirely inside y, then x would be entirely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, for this to be true, x would have to be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. But again, this would mean x is entirely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This would mean z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. For this to be possible, the part of x inside y would have to completely contain z, and z would have to touch the boundary of that part of x that's inside y. This seems possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For this to be possible, the part of x inside y would have to completely contain z, and z would have to be away from the boundary of that part of x that's inside y. This seems possible.
8. EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would have to be exactly the same. But if z is entirely inside y, then x would be entirely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check these conclusions:

From the given conditions:
1. PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y, meaning some part of x is inside y and some part is outside y.
2. NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y): z is entirely contained within y and away from y's boundary.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): The part of x inside y doesn't overlap with z. This is possible.
2. EC(x,z): The part of x inside y touches the boundary of z. But z is away from the boundary of y, so if the part of x inside y touches the boundary of z, it does so from the interior of y. But then, since x and z are only touching at their boundaries (EC), the part of x inside y cannot be inside z. So it's touching z's boundary from the outside. But then, since z is away from the boundary of y, how can the part of x inside y touch z's boundary from the outside without going through z? It can't. So EC(x,z) is not possible.
3. PO(x,z): The part of x inside y partially overlaps with z. This is possible.
4. TPP(x,z): x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is entirely inside z, and z is entirely inside y, then x is entirely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is entirely inside z and away from z's boundary. But similar to the previous case, this would mean x is entirely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with PO(x,y) because x can be partially inside y and partially outside y, and the part that's inside y can contain z. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is entirely inside x and away from x's boundary. Similar to the previous case, this is consistent with PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are exactly the same. But if z is entirely inside y, then this would mean x is entirely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me make one more check about EC(x,z). I've been saying it's not possible, but let me be very clear about the reason.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors. Now, z is entirely inside y and away from y's boundary. x is partially inside y. The part of x inside y either overlaps with z or it doesn't. If it doesn't, then x and z are disconnected (DC). If it does, then x and z have overlapping interiors, which contradicts EC(x,z). So there's no way for x and z to be EC.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.
4. NTPPi(x,z): z is entirely inside x and away from x's boundary.

That seems correct. Let me visualize these to double-check.

DC(x,z): Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that partially overlaps with y but doesn't overlap with z. For example, x could be a shape that intersects with the right side of y, and z could be a small circle on the left side of y.

PO(x,z): Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that partially overlaps with both y and z. For example, x could be a shape that intersects with the left side of y, and z could be a small circle on the left side of y such that x partially covers z.

TPPi(x,z): Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that completely covers z and touches z's boundary, but x also extends outside of y. For example, x could be a shape that extends from the center of y outward, such that it covers z completely and also extends beyond the boundary of y.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to the above, but now x doesn't touch z's boundary. Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that completely covers z with some margin (i.e., z is away from the boundary of x), and x also extends outside of y.

Yes, all of these seem consistent with the given conditions. So the possible relationships between x and z are DC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me reconsider TPPi(x,z) carefully. TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.

Given that NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y), which means z is entirely inside y and away from y's boundary, can z touch the boundary of x?

Let's think about this: z is entirely inside y and away from y's boundary. x partially overlaps with y. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary.

Since z is away from y's boundary and is contained within y, any part of x that is outside y cannot touch z. So if z touches the boundary of x, it must touch the part of the boundary of x that is inside y.

But is this possible? Yes, it is. Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that extends from inside y to outside y, with its boundary cutting through z. In this case, z would be entirely inside x and would touch the boundary of x, which is consistent with TPPi(x,z).

So yes, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship. So the possible relationships between x and z are indeed DC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, hmm, I need to be more careful. We need to make sure the regions are considered as interiors + boundaries, and the relations are defined in a way that's consisten with this. Let me go through our relations one more time:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, sharing no points.
2. EC(x,y): x and y share boundary points but no interior points.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is completely contained in y, sharing at least one boundary point.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is completely contained in y, sharing no boundary points.
6. TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x): y is completely contained in x, sharing at least one boundary point.
7. NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x): y is completely contained in x, sharing no boundary points.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are identical.

Now, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that's inside y doesn't overlap with z.
2. EC(x,z): I previously said this isn't possible, but let's be more careful. For EC(x,z), x and z would share boundary points but no interior points. Since z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, the part of x that's outside y cannot share points with z. So, it's the part of x inside y that would have to share boundary points with z. But can this happen without x and z sharing interior points? Yes, if the boundary of the part of x inside y touches the boundary of z. Hmm, this is trickier than I thought. Let me try a different approach.

Actually, wait, I said EC(x,z) wasn't possible, and I think that's correct. If x and z share a boundary point, that point is inside y (since z is entirely inside y). Now, in the interior of y, the boundary of z separates the interior of z from the exterior of z. So, if x shares a boundary point with z inside y, then either x is inside z or outside z at that point. If x is inside z at that point, then x and z share interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z). If x is outside z at that point, then x and z don't share that boundary point, which contradicts our assumption. So, EC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if the part of x inside y partially overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely contained in z and shares boundary points with z. But if x is completely contained in z, and z is completely contained in y, then x is completely contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this would mean x is completely contained in z and doesn't share boundary points with z. But again, this would mean x is completely contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's think about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) in a different way.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x): This would mean z is completely contained in x and shares boundary points with x. Given that z is completely inside y, the part of x that contains z must also be inside y. But since PO(x,y), part of x is also outside y. So yes, TPPi(x,z) is possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't share boundary points with x. Similar to the previous case, this is consistent with PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. But if z is completely inside y, and x is identical to z, then x would be completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and shares boundary points with x.
4. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't share boundary points with x.

I think this aligns with my previous conclusion, so I'm confident this is the correct answer.

Actually, let me once more check on EC(x,z). I said it's not possible, and my reasoning was that if x and z share a boundary point inside y, then either x is inside z or outside z at that point. If x is inside z, they share interior points, contradicting EC. If x is outside z, they don't share that boundary point, contradicting our assumption.

But I'm not fully confident in this reasoning. Let's approach it differently.

EC(x,z) means x and z share boundary points but no interior points. Since z is completely inside y, any shared boundary points would be inside y. Now, if x and z share a boundary point inside y, can they do so without sharing interior points?

Let's try to visualize this: Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that extends from inside y to outside y. Can x touch the boundary of z without overlapping with the interior of z? If x approaches z from outside, it can touch the boundary of z, but then it would also have to either go inside z or stay outside z. If it goes inside z, then x and z share interior points, contradicting EC. If it stays outside z, then x and z only share that one boundary point.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. In a 2D space, regions should be topologically defined with boundaries and interiors. If x and z share a boundary point, then there should be a neighborhood around that point where some of x's interior is inside z, or some of z's interior is inside x, or both. If neither is the case, then x and z would share just a single point, which doesn't fit with the notion of "touching at the boundary".

Hmm, let me try a different approach. The RCC-8 calculus is based on point-set topology. In this context, EC(x,y) means that the intersection of the closures of x and y is non-empty, but the intersection of the interiors is empty. 

Given that z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, can x touch the boundary of z without sharing interior points with z? If x approaches z from outside, it would touch the boundary of z at some point. But for this to be a "touch" in the RCC-8 sense, there would have to be a neighborhood around that point where some of x's interior is outside z. But since x and z are both 2D regions, if they touch at a point, there must be a neighborhood around that point where some of x's interior is inside z or some of z's interior is inside x, or both. If neither is the case, then x and z would share just a single point, which doesn't fit with the RCC-8 definition of EC.

So, it seems that EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship, given the constraints.

Let me go back to the eight RCC relations and their definitions, just to make sure I'm understanding them correctly.

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. The closures of x and y are disjoint.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. The closures of x and y intersect, but the interiors of x and y are disjoint.
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. The interiors of x and y intersect, but neither is contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. The interior of x is contained in the interior of y, and the boundaries of x and y intersect.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. The interior of x is contained in the interior of y, and the boundaries of x and y do not intersect.
6. TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal. The closures of x and y are equal.

Now, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), let's reconsider the possibility of EC(x,z).

For EC(x,z), the closures of x and z would intersect, but the interiors would not. Since z is completely inside y, the closure of z is also completely inside y. For the closures of x and z to intersect, the closure of x must intersect with the closure of z inside y. But since PO(x,y), the interior of x intersects with the interior of y. So, there are points in the interior of x that are also in the interior of y. If the closure of x intersects with the closure of z inside y, can the interior of x and the interior of z be disjoint?

Well, if the interior of x and the interior of y intersect, and z is completely inside y, the interior of x could still be disjoint from the interior of z. For example, imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y, and x as a shape that intersects with the right side of y, while z is on the left side of y. In this case, the interior of x and the interior of y intersect, but the interior of x and the interior of z are disjoint.

But for EC(x,z) to be true, the closures of x and z must intersect. Can the closures of x and z intersect while the interiors remain disjoint? Yes, if the boundary of x touches the boundary of z.

Given that z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, the boundary of z is inside the interior of y. So, for the boundary of x to touch the boundary of z, the boundary of x must extend into the interior of y. This is consistent with PO(x,y), since part of x is inside y.

So, it seems EC(x,z) is a possible relationship. But wait, I just talked myself into a contradiction with my earlier reasoning. Let me be more careful.

OK, EC(x,z) means the closures of x and z intersect, but the interiors of x and z are disjoint. Since z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, the closure of z is completely inside the interior of y.

Now, if the closures of x and z intersect, it means there's a point p that's in both the closure of x and the closure of z. Since the closure of z is completely inside the interior of y, p is in the interior of y. 

Now, p is either in the boundary of z or in the interior of z. If p is in the interior of z, then p is in the intersection of the closure of x and the interior of z. For the interiors of x and z to be disjoint, p cannot be in the interior of x. So, p must be in the boundary of x. But this means the boundary of x passes through the interior of z, which doesn't seem consistent with EC(x,z).

If p is in the boundary of z, then p is in the intersection of the closure of x and the boundary of z. For the interiors of x and z to be disjoint, p cannot be in the interior of x. So, p must be in the boundary of x. But this means the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. Is this consistent with EC(x,z)? Yes, this is exactly what EC(x,z) means.

So, EC(x,z) is possible if the boundary of x touches the boundary of z at a point inside the interior of y.

OK, I've gone back and forth a lot on this, so let me make sure we're on the same page: EC(x,z) means the closures of x and z intersect, but the interiors do not. The closure of a set is the set itself plus its boundary. So, EC(x,z) means that the boundaries of x and z touch, but the interiors don't overlap. So, the point of contact must be on the boundary of both x and z.

Given that z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, the boundary of z is inside the interior of y. For the boundary of x to touch the boundary of z, part of x must extend into the interior of y (which is consistent with PO(x,y)). So yes, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Let me recap: Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Actually wait, I don't think EC(x,z) is possible. Let me just try to visualize a situation where EC(x,z) is true, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that extends from inside y to outside y. For EC(x,z), the boundary of x should touch the boundary of z, but the interiors shouldn't overlap. So, x would have to approach z from the outside, touch the boundary of z, and then retreat. But this means x is "reaching in" from the outside to touch z. But since z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, x would have to pass through the interior of y to reach z. But if x is passing through the interior of y, and z is in the interior of y, how can x touch the boundary of z without either entering or exiting z? It can't. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

The point is: If x and z touch at a point on their boundaries, since they are 2D regions in a 2D space, there must be a neighborhood around that point where x is on one side of the boundary of z and z is on one side of the boundary of x. But since z is completely inside y, the boundary of z is completely inside y. So, if x approaches the boundary of z inside y, it must either enter z or exit z. If it enters z, then x and z share interior points, contradicting EC(x,z). If it exits z, then x and z don't share the boundary point, contradicting our assumption. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

I think I was overthinking things earlier. So, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
4. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

But wait, let me rethink EC(x,z) again, because I'm going back and forth on this. EC(x,z) means the closures of x and z intersect, but the interiors don't. This means the boundaries of x and z touch at one or more points, but the interiors don't overlap.

Given NTPP(z,y), z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary. Given PO(x,y), part of x is inside y and part is outside.

For EC(x,z), the boundaries of x and z must touch. Since z is completely inside y, this touch must occur inside y. The part of x inside y must touch the boundary of z.

But can the part of x inside y touch the boundary of z without the interior of x overlapping with the interior of z? Let's try to visualize this.

NTPP(z,y) means the interior of z is contained in the interior of y, and the boundaries of z and y do not intersect. PO(x,y) means the interiors of x and y intersect, but neither is contained in the other.

Let me be more explicit about the parts of x relative to y. Since PO(x,y), there are three parts of x: the part inside y, the part on the boundary of y, and the part outside y. The part of x inside y is in the interior of y. The part of x on the boundary of y is on the boundary of y. The part of x outside y is outside the closure of y.

Now, for EC(x,z), the boundaries of x and z must touch. Since z is completely inside y, this touch must occur inside y. So, the boundary of the part of x inside y must touch the boundary of z. But the boundary of the part of x inside y is a subset of the boundary of x, not the boundary of the intersection of x and y.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try a different approach. In RCC-8, EC(x,z) means the interiors of x and z are disjoint, but the closures of x and z intersect. The closure of a set is the set itself plus its boundary.

Given NTPP(z,y), the closure of z is completely inside the interior of y.

Given PO(x,y), the interior of x intersects with the interior of y, and some of the interior of x is outside the closure of y.

For EC(x,z), the interiors of x and z are disjoint, and the closures of x and z intersect. Since the closure of z is completely inside the interior of y, the intersection of the closures of x and z must be inside the interior of y. This intersection is a subset of the boundary of x and a subset of the boundary of z.

So, inside the interior of y, the boundary of x must intersect with the boundary of z. But the interior of x must be disjoint from the interior of z.

OK, let me try to visualize a situation where EC(x,z) is true, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that extends from inside y to outside y. For EC(x,z), the boundary of x should touch the boundary of z, but the interiors shouldn't overlap. So, x would have to approach z from the outside, touch the boundary of z, and then retreat. But here's the issue: if x is approaching z from the outside, and z is completely inside y, then x must pass through the interior of y to reach z. As x passes through the interior of y, it can either enter the interior of z or stay outside the closure of z. If it enters the interior of z, then EC(x,z) is false. If it stays outside the closure of z, then EC(x,z) is also false. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually no, EC(x,z) could be possible. Imagine a scenario where there's a part of x inside y that doesn't intersect with z, and there's a part of x that's outside y. If the boundary of the part of x inside y touches the boundary of z, then EC(x,z) is true, as long as the interiors don't overlap.

Hmm, let's reconsider with a specific configuration. Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a 'C' shaped region where the 'back' of the 'C' is outside y, and the 'arms' of the 'C' extend into the interior of y, with the 'arms' touching the boundary of z, but not entering the interior of z. In this configuration, the closure of x (which includes its boundary) intersects with the closure of z (which includes its boundary) at the points where the 'arms' of the 'C' touch the boundary of z. But the interior of x and the interior of z are disjoint. So, EC(x,z) is true.

So yes, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

So, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Actually wait, I'm overthinking this. I think I may be misunderstanding what the boundary of the part of x inside y means. The boundary of the part of x inside y is not necessarily a subset of the boundary of x. The boundary of the part of x inside y is the boundary of the intersection of x and y. Some of this boundary is on the boundary of x, and some is on the boundary of y.

For EC(x,z), the boundaries of x and z must touch, but the interiors mustn't overlap. Since z is completely inside y, this touch must occur inside y. The part of the boundary of x that's inside y must touch the boundary of z. But can the part of the boundary of x that's inside y touch the boundary of z without the interior of x overlapping with the interior of z?

Actually, I think I was overthinking this. The boundary of x can indeed touch the boundary of z without the interiors overlapping. For example, imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y, and x as a shape that extends from outside y into the interior of y, with the boundary of x touching the boundary of z but not entering the interior of z. In this configuration, the boundaries of x and z touch, but the interiors don't overlap, so EC(x,z) is true.

So, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

OK, let me try to settle this by being more careful. I'll use the precise definitions of the relations. In the RCC-8 calculus:

1. DC(x,y) means x ∩ y = ∅, i.e., x and y do not share any points, including boundary points.
2. EC(x,y) means int(x) ∩ int(y) = ∅ and x ∩ y ≠ ∅, i.e., x and y share some points (which must be boundary points), but their interiors do not share any points.
3. PO(x,y) means int(x) ∩ int(y) ≠ ∅ and x ⊈ y and y ⊈ x, i.e., the interiors of x and y share some points, but neither is contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,y) means x ⊂ y and x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅, i.e., x is a proper subset of y and x shares some points with the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,y) means x ⊂ int(y), i.e., x is a proper subset of the interior of y.
6. TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x)
7. NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x)
8. EQ(x,y) means x = y.

Here, int(x) denotes the interior of x, and ∂x denotes the boundary of x.

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), we know:
1. int(x) ∩ int(y) ≠ ∅ and x ⊈ y and y ⊈ x
2. z ⊂ int(y)

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) means x ∩ z = ∅. This is possible if the part of x inside y doesn't overlap with z.
2. EC(x,z) means int(x) ∩ int(z) = ∅ and x ∩ z ≠ ∅. This is possible if the part of x inside y touches the boundary of z but doesn't enter the interior of z.
3. PO(x,z) means int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅ and x ⊈ z and z ⊈ x. This is possible if the part of x inside y partially overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z) means x ⊂ z and x ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅. This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. But if x is completely contained in z, and z is completely contained in y, then x is completely contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z) means x ⊂ int(z). Similar to the previous case, this would mean x is completely contained in the interior of z, which would imply x is completely contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x) means z ⊂ x and z ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅. This is possible if the part of x inside y completely contains z and z touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x) means z ⊂ int(x). This is possible if the part of x inside y completely contains z in its interior.
8. EQ(x,z) means x = z. But if z is completely inside y, and x is equal to z, then x would be completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Wait let's just double check EC(x,z) = "x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap". Can I come up with an example to make it clearer? Let's try.

Imagine y as a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin, and z as a circle of radius 1 centered at (1, 0). Clearly, z is completely inside y and away from its boundary, so NTPP(z,y) is true.

Now, let's define x as the region outside the circle of radius 2 centered at (2, 0). The boundary of x is the circle of radius 2 centered at (2, 0).

Let's check PO(x,y):
- The circle of radius 2 centered at (2, 0) intersects with the circle of radius 3 centered at the origin. So, x and y share some points.
- Part of x is inside y and part is outside y. So, neither is contained in the other.
- So, PO(x,y) is true.

Now, let's check EC(x,z):
- The boundary of x (the circle of radius 2 centered at (2, 0)) touches the boundary of z (the circle of radius 1 centered at (1, 0)) at the point (3, 0).
- The interior of x does not overlap with the interior of z.
- So, EC(x,z) is true.

So yes, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

So, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

OK, I got distracted by the details of EC(x,z). Let me summarize the possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y). The possible relations are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So the answer is DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, wait, that doesn't seem right. In my recent analysis above, I used NTPP(z,y). But the problem statement is NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y). So the two agree. Let me make sure I used the correct interpretation for the whole problem.

The problem statement says:
1. PO(x,y), which means x and y partially overlap; they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is entirely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these, we want to find the possible relationships between x and z. Yes, I used the correct interpretation above. So, the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, uh-oh. I meant to say NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(y,z).

Let me clearly interpret NTPPi(y,z) to make sure I get it right. NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of z. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me correct my understanding.

NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Wait, that doesn't match the English meaning of NTPPi. Let me try again.

NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y) = y ⊂ int(z). So, y is a proper subset of the interior of z. But wait, I thought NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper subset of the interior of y? So NTPP(z,y) would mean z is a proper subset of the interior of y, right?

Let me clarify. The "i" in NTPPi stands for "inverse". So:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which is exactly what I've been saying. So, I've been interpreting NTPPi(y,z) correctly as "z is entirely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary."

Let me correct my understanding once and for all. The "i" stands for "inverse". So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

OK, and now I need to double check this with our original definition of the relation, just to make sure:

NTPP(z,y) means z ⊂ int(y), i.e., z is a proper subset of the interior of y.

Yes, that checks out. So NTPP(z,y) means z is completely inside the interior of y, and NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y). I've been interpreting NTPPi(y,z) correctly.

So, given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So the answer is DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what constraints the given relationships place on the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y); z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is entirely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let me consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Since z is completely inside y and x is only partially inside y, x could be positioned so that it doesn't overlap with z at all.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. The part of x that extends into y could touch the boundary of z without overlapping with z's interior.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. The part of x that extends into y could partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x were completely inside z, and z is completely inside y, then x would be completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. The part of x inside y could completely contain z, with z touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. The part of x inside y could completely contain z, with z not touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If x and z were equal, and z is completely inside y, then x would be completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
