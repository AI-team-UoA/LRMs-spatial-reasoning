PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step-by-step.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary

I need to find all possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze what's happening:

- y is contained within z, touching z's boundary
- x only touches y at their boundaries

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
Is it possible that x and z don't share any parts or boundaries? 
Since y touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible that x is completely outside z, not touching z's boundary. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
Is it possible that x touches z's boundary but shares no interior parts?
Since y touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible that x touches z exactly at the point where y touches z. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
Is it possible that x and z share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other?
Since x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and y is contained in z, it's not immediately obvious if x can partially overlap with z. Let me think about this more carefully.

Actually, it is possible. Imagine y touches z's boundary at some region, and x touches y's boundary at a different region. It's possible for x to partially extend into z while still only externally connecting with y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
Is it possible that x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary?
Since x only touches y at the boundary, and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's possible that x is also a tangential proper part of z, if the boundary of x that touches y also coincides with the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
Is it possible that x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary?
This seems impossible given our constraints. Since x only touches y at their boundaries and doesn't share interior parts with y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, there's no way for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Wait, I need to reconsider. If x touches y only at some point of y's boundary that is not where y touches z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
Is it possible that z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary?
This would mean z is contained within x, which contradicts that y is a proper part of z and x only externally connects with y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
Is it possible that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary?
Similar to TPPi, this contradicts our given relations. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
Is it possible that x and z are the same region?
This contradicts our given relations because y is a proper part of z, and x only externally connects with y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning for each case.

For DC(x,z):
- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries
- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, touching z's boundary
- It's possible that x touches y at a part of y's boundary that doesn't coincide with z's boundary. In this case, x would be completely outside z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z):
- If x touches y at exactly the point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
- If x touches y at their boundaries and part of x extends into z, while another part remains outside z, then x and z would partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
- If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary (possibly at the same point where y touches z's boundary), then TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
- If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z (not where y touches z's boundary), and x is entirely contained within z, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z):
- These all contradict our given relations, as they would require z to be contained within or equal to x, which is inconsistent with y being a proper part of z and x only externally connecting with y.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I need to be more careful about NTPP(x,z). Let me reconsider.

For NTPP(x,z):
- This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y's interior
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

Can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while only touching y's boundary? This seems problematic. If x only touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then either:
1. x touches y at the point where y touches z's boundary (making x touch z's boundary too, so not NTPP)
2. x touches y at a different point on y's boundary (which would be inside z)

In case 2, x would still be touching y's boundary, which is inside z, but not touching z's boundary. This scenario is consistent with NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to be even more careful. Let's be precise about what "touching at a boundary" means. In RCC-8, "touching at a boundary" means the closures of the regions intersect, but their interiors don't.

So in the case of EC(x,y), the closure of x intersects with the closure of y, but the interior of x doesn't intersect with the interior of y.

Given TPP(y,z), the closure of y is a subset of the closure of z, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z. Also, the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z.

Now, for NTPP(x,z), the closure of x must be a subset of the interior of z. But if x touches y at their boundaries, and y touches z at their boundaries, can x still be in the interior of z?

Let's think about this spatially. If y touches z's boundary at some region A, and x touches y's boundary at some region B, then:
- If B is a subset of A, then x would touch z's boundary too (not NTPP)
- If B is disjoint from A, then B would be inside z, so x touches a part of y's boundary that is inside z

In the second case, x can indeed be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I need to reconsider DC(x,z) once more. 

For DC(x,z):
- This means x and z are completely disconnected
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

If x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z (even if y touches z's boundary), can x still be completely disconnected from z?

If y touches z's boundary at some region A, and x touches y's boundary at some region B:
- If B is a subset of A, then x would touch z's boundary too (not DC)
- If B is disjoint from A, then B would be inside z, so x touches a part of y's boundary that is inside z

In both cases, x would have some connection to z, either by touching z's boundary or by touching a part of y that is inside z. So DC(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Let me recheck this. If x only touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, then x must either:
1. Touch z's boundary directly (making it EC, not DC)
2. Touch a part of y's boundary that is inside z (making it connected to z in some way, not DC)

So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But I need to reconsider PO(x,z) as well. 

For PO(x,z):
- This means x and z partially overlap; they share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

If x doesn't share interior parts with y, and y is inside z, can x still partially overlap with z?

If x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't overlap with y's interior, then x doesn't overlap with any part of y that is inside z. For x to partially overlap with z, some part of x must be inside z while another part is outside z.

Given that x only touches y at the boundary, if x has a part inside z, it must be because that part of x extends into z beyond the boundary of y that it touches. This seems geometrically possible. Imagine x as a region that touches y at some point on y's boundary, with part of x extending into z and part extending outside z.

So PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let's check TPP(x,z) again:

For TPP(x,z):
- This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

If x doesn't share interior parts with y, can x still be a proper part of z?

The constraint EC(x,y) means x and y only touch at their boundaries. If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, but only touches y at the boundary, then x must be in a part of z that is not occupied by y. This seems geometrically possible.

So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Let's once more verify NTPP(x,z):

For NTPP(x,z):
- This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

If x touches y only at the boundary, and that point on y's boundary is inside z (not where y touches z's boundary), then x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to be more careful about PO(x,z). Let me reconsider.

For PO(x,z):
- This means x and z partially overlap; they share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

Let's think about this geometrically. If x only touches y at the boundary and y is inside z, for x to partially overlap with z, some part of x must be inside z while another part is outside z.

Since x and y only touch at their boundaries, x doesn't overlap with any part of y's interior. But since y is inside z, if x were to have a part inside z, that part would need to be in a region of z that doesn't overlap with y.

Is this geometrically possible? Yes, it is. Imagine y as a region inside z, touching z's boundary at some point. Now imagine x as a region that touches y's boundary at some other point (not where y touches z), with part of x extending into z beyond that touching point, and part of x extending outside z.

So PO(x,z) is possible.

Let me make one more check on each of these relations to make sure I haven't missed anything.

For EC(x,z):
- This means x touches z at the boundary but doesn't share interior parts
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

If x touches y at exactly the point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary without sharing interior parts. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):
- This means x and z partially overlap; they share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

For x to partially overlap with z, some part of x must be inside z while another part is outside z. This can happen if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z, and then extends both into and out of z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
- This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

For this to be true, x must be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary, while only touching y at their boundaries. This can happen if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that coincides with z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
- This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

For this to be true, x must be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, while only touching y at their boundaries. This can happen if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z, not where y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I need to reconsider DC(x,z) once more to be absolutely sure.

For DC(x,z):
- This means x and z are completely disconnected
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

Is it possible for x to be completely disconnected from z, while touching y's boundary, and y is inside z?

If y is inside z, then any point on y's boundary is either:
1. On z's boundary (where y touches z)
2. Inside z (where y doesn't touch z)

If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is on z's boundary, then x also touches z, so they're not disconnected.

If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z, then x must extend into z at that point, so x and z are connected.

So there's no way for x to touch y's boundary without also having some connection to z. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Finally, I think I've analyzed all possibilities correctly. The possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hold on, I need to reconsider. I think I made an error in my analysis of TPP(x,z). 

For TPP(x,z):
- This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

For x to be a proper part of z, x must be entirely contained within z. But given EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y. If x is entirely inside z and only touches y at the boundary, there would need to be a part of x that overlaps with y's interior (since y is inside z), which contradicts EC(x,y).

So I don't think TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I need to be more careful. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. EC(x,y) means x touches y at the boundary but doesn't share interior parts. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let me visualize this: z is the outer region, y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y only at the boundary. Can x be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary?

If x touches y only at their boundaries, and that point is where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary. However, for x to be entirely inside z, the rest of x must be inside z without overlapping with y's interior (since EC(x,y)). This seems geometrically possible.

For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at point P, and x as another region inside z that touches y only at point P (which is also on z's boundary). The rest of x extends inside z but doesn't overlap with y's interior.

So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me once more verify each of the relations I've identified.

For EC(x,z):
- This is possible if x touches y at exactly the point where y touches z's boundary, so x also touches z's boundary without sharing interior parts.

For PO(x,z):
- This is possible if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z, and part of x extends into z while another part extends outside z.

For TPP(x,z):
- This is possible if x touches y at the point where y touches z's boundary, and the rest of x is entirely inside z without overlapping with y's interior.

For NTPP(x,z):
- This is possible if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z (not where y touches z's boundary), and the rest of x is entirely inside z without overlapping with y's interior.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let's reconsider TPP(x,z) one more time because I'm still confused. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z (entirely contained within z) and touches z's boundary. EC(x,y) means x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y's interior. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's be very careful about "touching at the boundary." In RCC-8, two regions touch at their boundaries if their closures intersect but their interiors don't.

For TPP(x,z), the closure of x must be a subset of the closure of z, and the interior of x must be a subset of the interior of z. Also, the boundary of x must intersect with the boundary of z.

For EC(x,y), the closure of x intersects with the closure of y, but the interior of x doesn't intersect with the interior of y.

Given these constraints, is it possible for TPP(x,z) to hold? If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, while also touching y only at the boundary, it must be that x touches y at exactly the point where y touches z's boundary. But is this geometrically possible without x overlapping with y's interior?

Let's think about this in terms of topology. If x and y both touch z's boundary at the same point, they must also touch each other at that point. But for x to be entirely inside z, it can't extend outside z at that touching point. And for x to not overlap with y's interior, it can't extend into y from that touching point either.

Actually, I think TPP(x,z) is possible in this scenario. Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at point P, and x as an even smaller circle inside z that also touches z's boundary at point P. If x and y only touch at point P, then x doesn't overlap with y's interior, satisfying EC(x,y). And if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary at point P, it satisfies TPP(x,z).

So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

OK, so the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to reconsider DC(x,z) one more time. I think I've been interpreting "touching" too strictly.

For DC(x,z):
- This means x and z are completely disconnected
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary
- Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary

Is it possible for x to be completely disconnected from z, while touching y's boundary, and y is inside z?

Let's be precise about what "touching" means in RCC-8. Two regions touch if their closures intersect but their interiors don't. So for EC(x,y), the closure of x intersects with the closure of y, but the interior of x doesn't intersect with the interior of y.

For DC(x,z), the closure of x doesn't intersect with the closure of z. But if y is inside z, its closure is a subset of the closure of z. So if the closure of x intersects with the closure of y (which is EC(x,y)), it must also intersect with the closure of z, contradicting DC(x,z).

Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the final answer is that the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given information:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible. Since y is inside z and x touches y's boundary, x must have some connection to z.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible. If x touches y at exactly the point where y touches z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary without sharing interior parts.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z, and part of x extends into z while another part extends outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. If x touches y at the point where y touches z's boundary, and the rest of x is entirely inside z without overlapping with y's interior.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z (not where y touches z's boundary), and x is entirely contained within z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible. This would require z to be inside x, contradicting that y is inside z and x only externally connects with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible. Similarly contradicts the given relations.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. This would contradict y being a proper part of z.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
