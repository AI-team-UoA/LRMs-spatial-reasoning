PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. We know PO(x,y), which means x and y partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.

2. We know EC(y,z), which means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. **DC(x,z)** (Disconnected): This is possible. If x overlaps with y in a region that doesn't touch z, then x and z could be completely disconnected.

2. **EC(x,z)** (Externally Connected): This is possible. If x overlaps with y in a way that its boundary touches z's boundary (through y's boundary), then x and z would be externally connected.

3. **PO(x,z)** (Partially Overlapping): This is possible. If x extends beyond the region where it overlaps with y, and that extension overlaps with z, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. **TPP(x,z)** (Tangential Proper Part): This is possible. If x is smaller than z, touches z's boundary, and is completely contained within z, then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** (Non-Tangential Proper Part): This seems unlikely given the constraints. If x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, it would mean x is separated from y's boundary that touches z, which contradicts the partial overlap of x and y.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** (Inverse Tangential Proper Part): This is possible. If z is smaller than x, touches x's boundary, and is completely contained within x, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** (Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part): This is possible. If z is completely inside x without touching its boundary, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. **EQ(x,z)** (Equal): This seems unlikely. If x and z are equal, and y partially overlaps with x, then y would also partially overlap with z, contradicting the external connection of y and z.

Hmm, I need to be more careful with my reasoning. Let me try to visualize some specific examples to confirm these possibilities.

For DC(x,z): Imagine y as a bridge between x and z. x overlaps with one end of y, z touches the other end of y, but x and z are far apart.

For EC(x,z): Imagine y as a bridge, but this time x and z touch at a point or boundary, with y overlapping x and touching z.

For PO(x,z): This gets tricky. If y partially overlaps with x and externally connects with z, for x to partially overlap with z, there would need to be a region of x that extends beyond y and into z. But this would mean y is not just externally connected to z but also partially overlaps with it. So, I'm skeptical of this possibility.

Actually, I need to be more precise. Let's think about the regions and their boundaries:

- PO(x,y) means x and y share some interior points, but not all.
- EC(y,z) means y and z share boundary points but no interior points.

For x and z to partially overlap (PO), they would need to share interior points. But given the constraints, the only way for x to have interior points in z would be if x extends beyond the boundary of y into z. But this would mean y and z share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, I think PO(x,z) is not possible after all.

Let's re-evaluate:

1. **DC(x,z)** (Disconnected): Possible. x can overlap with y in a region that's away from z.

2. **EC(x,z)** (Externally Connected): Possible. x can overlap with y and extend to the boundary where y and z meet.

3. **PO(x,z)** (Partially Overlapping): After reconsideration, this seems possible. x can overlap with y and extend into z, creating a partial overlap between x and z. For instance, if y is a bridge between x and z, x could overlap with part of y and extend into a part of z. 

Wait, I need to be careful here. If x extends into z and shares interior points with z, and x also shares interior points with y (because of PO(x,y)), then y and z would share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z). So, I think PO(x,z) is not possible.

Let's revisit. We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y share interior points.
- EC(y,z): y and z share boundary points but no interior points.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z with some part of x touching z's boundary. If x is also partially overlapping with y, then y would have interior points inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) would mean x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. This, combined with PO(x,y), would again imply y has interior points inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x with some part of z touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. But if z is completely inside x, then y and x would share more than just the overlapping region, potentially contradicting PO(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. But if z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would have to extend inside x to touch z, potentially contradicting PO(x,y).

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), this would imply y both partially overlaps with z and is externally connected to z, which is a contradiction.

Let me think about this more carefully, considering the boundary and interior of each region.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this a bit. Let's construct some concrete examples to check each possibility:

1. **DC(x,z)** (Disconnected): Imagine x and y as overlapping circles, and z as a separate circle that touches y at a single point. Here, x and z are completely disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. **EC(x,z)** (Externally Connected): Imagine x, y, and z as three circles in a row, where x and y overlap, and y and z touch at a single point. If x is positioned such that it extends to the point where y and z touch, then x and z would be externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. **PO(x,z)** (Partially Overlapping): Let's visualize this. If x and y partially overlap, and y and z are externally connected, for x and z to partially overlap, x would need to extend beyond the boundary of y into z. But this would mean y and z share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z).

Actually, I think I might have been mistaken. Let's try a different visualization. Imagine y as a thin strip or bridge. x partially overlaps with one end of the strip, and z touches the other end of the strip. If x extends across the strip and also into a portion of z, then x and z could partially overlap while y and z remain externally connected.

But wait, this doesn't work either. If x extends into z and shares interior points with z, and x also shares interior points with y (because of PO(x,y)), then y and z would share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z).

I think the issue is that I'm not properly accounting for the constraints of the relations. Let me be more systematic:

- PO(x,y) means x and y share some interior points, but not all.
- EC(y,z) means y and z share boundary points but no interior points.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to share interior points. But given the constraints, the only way for x to have interior points in z would be if x extends beyond the boundary of y into z. But if x shares interior points with both y and z, then by transitivity, y and z would share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

Let's continue with the other possibilities:

4. **TPP(x,z)** (Tangential Proper Part): For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z with some part of x touching z's boundary. If x is also partially overlapping with y, then y would have interior points inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me be more careful. If x is tangential proper part of z (inside z, touching z's boundary), and x partially overlaps with y, then parts of y would be inside z (the parts that overlap with x). But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z share only boundary points.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** (Non-Tangential Proper Part): For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This, combined with PO(x,y), would imply y has interior points inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** (Inverse Tangential Proper Part): For this to be true, z would be a tangential proper part of x. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. For z to be inside x and touch x's boundary, y would need to overlap with x in a way that it also touches z, but only at its boundary. This seems geometrically feasible. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me double-check: z is completely inside x, touching x's boundary. y touches z at its boundary, and y partially overlaps with x. This creates a scenario where y extends outside of x, partly overlaps with x, and touches z at its boundary. This seems consistent with the given constraints.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** (Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part): For this to be true, z would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. For z to be inside x without touching x's boundary, y would need to reach inside x to touch z. This seems geometrically feasible. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Again, let me double-check: z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. y touches z at its boundary, and y partially overlaps with x. This creates a scenario where y extends outside of x, partly overlaps with x, and reaches inside x to touch z at its boundary. This seems consistent with the given constraints.

8. **EQ(x,z)** (Equal): For this to be true, x and z would be the same region. But given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), this would imply y both partially overlaps with z and is externally connected to z, which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I made a mistake in the previous analysis. 

Let's revisit PO(x,z). We want to know if it's possible for x and z to share interior points while the given constraints hold. If x and z share interior points, then there's a region that belongs to both x and z. But from the constraints:
- PO(x,y): x and y share interior points.
- EC(y,z): y and z only share boundary points, not interior points.

If x shares interior points with both y and z, and y and z don't share interior points, then the interior points of x that overlap with y must be different from the interior points of x that overlap with z. This seems geometrically feasible.

Let me check this with a visualization: Imagine a scenario where x is spread across y and z, with one part of x overlapping the interior of y and another part overlapping the interior of z. The constraint EC(y,z) means y and z only touch at their boundaries, which means the part of x in y and the part of x in z are separated by the boundary between y and z. This seems consistent, so PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me re-check TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z with some part of x touching z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x and y share interior points. But if x is inside z, then parts of y (those that overlap with x) would also be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

Actually, the issue is with the boundary. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also shares interior points with y, then y would have to extend inside z to overlap with x. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which states y and z only touch at their boundaries. 

Actually wait. The fact that x and y share interior points (PO(x,y)) and x is inside z (TPP(x,z)) doesn't necessarily mean y has interior points inside z. It depends on how x and y overlap and how x is positioned inside z.

Let's try this again. Imagine x as a small region completely inside z, touching z's boundary. y is a larger region that partially overlaps with x (PO(x,y)) and touches z's boundary but doesn't go inside z (EC(y,z)). For this to work, the overlap between x and y would need to be in the area where both x and y touch z's boundary. But the question is, if y only touches z's boundary (not going inside), how can y overlap with the interior of x, which is inside z?

I think the issue is that if x is inside z (TPP(x,z)) and y overlaps with the interior of x (PO(x,y)), then y must have some interior points inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. With the same reasoning as above, this would contradict the given constraints. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's revisit TPPi(x,z). This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. The question is, can y partially overlap with x and touch z at its boundary, with z being inside x?

Imagine z as a small region inside x, touching x's boundary. y touches z at its boundary and extends outside of x, but also overlaps with parts of x. This seems geometrically feasible. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. The question is, can y partially overlap with x and touch z at its boundary, with z being inside x and not touching x's boundary?

Imagine z as a small region deep inside x, not touching x's boundary. y touches z at its boundary and extends outside of x, but also overlaps with parts of x. This seems geometrically feasible. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But this would mean y both partially overlaps with z (because PO(x,y)) and is externally connected to z (because EC(y,z)), which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually wait, I think I may have made a mistake about PO(x,z). Let's check it again.

If x and z share interior points (PO(x,z)), and y and z only share boundary points (EC(y,z)), then there's a portion of x inside z that doesn't overlap with y. Given that x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)), there's a portion of x inside y and a portion of x outside y. For x to share interior points with z, the portion of x outside y must extend into z.

But here's the challenge: If the boundary of y separates the portion of x inside y from the portion of x inside z (due to EC(y,z)), how does x maintain connectivity? If x is a connected region and part of it is inside y and another part is inside z, then x must cross the boundary between y and z. But if x crosses this boundary, then so does the overlap of x and y, which would contradict EC(y,z).

I think I need to be very careful about this and consider all the geometrical implications. Let me think through this again.

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), I want to determine if PO(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,y) means x and y share interior points, but neither is a part of the other. In other words, there are interior points of x that are not in y, and there are interior points of y that are not in x.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share interior points, but neither is a part of the other.

The question is, can x share interior points with z while y only touches z at its boundary?

One way to visualize this is to imagine y as a thin strip or border with x partially overlapping it on one side and z touching it on the other side. If x extends across the strip and into z, then x and z could share interior points.

But the problem is that if x shares interior points with both y and z, then by transitivity, y and z would share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z).

Wait, that's not necessarily true. Let's consider the example I just gave: y is a thin strip, x overlaps with y on one side, and z touches y on the other side. If x extends across the strip and into z, then x and z would share interior points. But y and z still only touch at their boundary, maintaining EC(y,z).

Let me think about this differently. Imagine three circles:
- Circle y is in the middle.
- Circle x overlaps with circle y on the left (PO(x,y)).
- Circle z touches circle y on the right (EC(y,z)).

If circle x is large enough, it could extend around (or through) circle y and overlap with circle z, creating PO(x,z).

But again, I'm not sure if this violates the constraint EC(y,z). If x extends through y to reach z, then x and y share a significant portion, which might contradict PO(x,y) (depending on the extent of the overlap).

Let me simplify and think about regions in 2D:
- Region y is a central square.
- Region x partially overlaps with the left half of square y.
- Region z touches square y on its right side (EC(y,z)).

For x to overlap with z, it would need to extend around or through y. If x extends around y, there's no issue. But if x extends through y, it might contradict the original constraints.

Actually, I think the way I've been visualizing this might be the issue. Let's reframe it:

1. Region y is a central unit.
2. Region x partly includes parts of y and parts of z. The part of x that overlaps with z does not overlap with y.
3. Regions y and z touch at their boundaries.

In this framing, PO(x,z) could be possible. Let me check this against the original constraints:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, which is satisfied.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries, which is satisfied.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some interior points, which is what we're trying to verify.

The question is, if x shares interior points with both y and z, is it possible for y and z to not share interior points?

I think the answer is yes. Imagine a dumbbell-shaped region x, where one bell overlaps with y and the other bell overlaps with z. The bar of the dumbbell passes through the boundary interface of y and z.

This maintains:
- PO(x,y): The left bell of x overlaps with y.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.
- PO(x,z): The right bell of x overlaps with z.

So, PO(x,z) is possible!

Let's review the complete list again to make sure I have the right answers:

1. **DC(x,z)** (Disconnected): Possible. If x overlaps with y in a region that's away from z, then x and z would be disconnected.

2. **EC(x,z)** (Externally Connected): Possible. If x overlaps with y and extends to the boundary where y and z touch, then x and z would be externally connected.

3. **PO(x,z)** (Partially Overlapping): Possible. If x has a dumbbell-like shape, with one bell overlapping y and the other bell overlapping z, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. **TPP(x,z)** (Tangential Proper Part): For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z with some part of x touching z's boundary. But if x is inside z and also partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at its boundary, there's a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** (Non-Tangential Proper Part): With the same reasoning as above, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** (Inverse Tangential Proper Part): For this to be true, z would be a tangential proper part of x. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. This seems geometrically feasible, with z inside x, touching x's boundary, and y touching z at its boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** (Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part): For this to be true, z would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. This is geometrically feasible, with z inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y extending inside x to touch z at its boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. **EQ(x,z)** (Equal): For this to be true, x and z would be the same region. But this would mean y both partially overlaps with z (because PO(x,y)) and is externally connected to z (because EC(y,z)), which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me rethink TPP(x,z). If x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), that means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x and y share interior points. But if x is inside z and shares interior points with y, then y would have interior points inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I think the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Let me check again quickly. 

DC(x,z) is possible because x and y could overlap in a region far from z.

EC(x,z) is possible because x could overlap with y and extend to the boundary where y and z touch.

For PO(x,z), I initially had doubts, but after careful consideration, I believe it's possible. x could have a dumbbell-like shape, with one end overlapping y and the other end overlapping z.

For TPP(x,z), if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also shares interior points with y, then y would have interior points inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x would be inside z without touching its boundary. If x also shares interior points with y, then y would have interior points inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a tangential proper part of x. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. This is geometrically feasible, with z inside x (touching x's boundary) and y touching z at its boundary and partially overlapping with x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. Given EC(y,z), y and z share boundary points. This is also geometrically feasible, with z inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y extending inside x to touch z at its boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But this would mean y both partially overlaps with z (because PO(x,y)) and is externally connected to z (because EC(y,z)), which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Let me finally double-check this by looking at a very specific example. 

Let's say we have:
- y is a central disk.
- x is a disk that partially overlaps with the left half of y.
- z is a disk that touches y at a point on its right.

If x is small enough, it will be disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

If x is larger, it might touch z at the same point where z touches y. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

If x is even larger, it might envelope z, making z a proper part of x. This gives us TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z), depending on whether z touches the boundary of x.

For PO(x,z), I had a dumbbell-shaped visualization, but let me adapt it to the current example. If x is shaped like a crescent that partly overlaps y on the left and extends around to overlap with z on the right, then PO(x,z) is possible.

I think I might have been overthinking this a bit. Let's stick with the final conclusion: The possible relationships between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait. I want to be sure my reasoning for PO(x,z) is correct. I said that a dumbbell-shaped region x could partially overlap with both y and z. But there's a subtlety here. If the "bar" of the dumbbell crosses the boundary interface between y and z, and the bell parts of the dumbbell share interior parts with y and z respectively, then:
- The part of x (the bar) that passes through the boundary interface of y and z must be part of the interiors of both y and z. But this contradicts EC(y,z).

Or perhaps the bar of the dumbbell goes around the exterior of y and z, not through the boundary interface. This would mean the dumbbell has a U-shape. In this case, PO(x,z) would be possible, as the part of x that overlaps with z doesn't directly overlap with y.

But it's in the latter case that I think PO(x,z) is possible. So, I'm standing by it.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, but I'm not 100% sure about whether PO(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me think about this differently. PO(x,y) means that x and y share some interior points, and x is not fully contained in y and y is not fully contained in x. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch only at their boundaries. PO(x,z) would mean that x and z share some interior points, and x is not fully contained in z and z is not fully contained in x.

Let's imagine this in 2D. Suppose y is a square, and x overlaps with the left half of y (i.e. x contains the left half of y, and parts of x are outside y on the left).

Now, z is a square that touches y on its right side. That means z and y share a boundary, but no interior points.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x must share interior points with z. One way to achieve this is for x to "wrap around" y and extend into z. So x would include the left half of y, extend both above and below y, and then come around to include a part of z.

Let me visualize this more carefully:
- y is a central disk.
- x contains the left half of y, and also extends to the north and south of y, then wraps around to overlap a part of z.
- z is a disk that touches y on its right side.

This way, x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with z (PO(x,z)).

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

To confirm once more, the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To answer this problem, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

I'll analyze each potential relationship:

1. **DC(x,z)** (Disconnected): Possible. If x overlaps with y in a region away from where y touches z, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. **EC(x,z)** (Externally Connected): Possible. If x overlaps with y and extends to the boundary where y and z touch, then x and z can touch at their boundaries.

3. **PO(x,z)** (Partially Overlapping): Possible. If x overlaps with y and also extends around y to overlap with part of z, then x and z can partially overlap. This can happen if x has a "U" or "C" shape that wraps around the exterior to connect the regions.

4. **TPP(x,z)** (Tangential Proper Part): Not possible. If x is inside z and touching z's boundary, and x also partially overlaps with y, then y would have to have interior points inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. **NTPP(x,z)** (Non-Tangential Proper Part): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP, if x is inside z, y would have to have interior points inside z.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** (Inverse Tangential Proper Part): Possible. Z can be inside x and touching x's boundary, while y touches z at z's boundary and partially overlaps with x.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** (Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part): Possible. Z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while y extends into x to touch z at z's boundary.

8. **EQ(x,z)** (Equal): Not possible. If x and z were equal, y would both partially overlap with z (because PO(x,y)) and be externally connected to z (because EC(y,z)), which is contradictory.
