PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what each of the given relations tells us:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. (Since NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y))

So we have:
- x is strictly inside y (doesn't touch the boundary)
- z is strictly inside y (doesn't touch the boundary)

What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

Well, x and z are both inside y, but their relationship to each other could be varied:

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC), meaning they don't share any spatial parts.
2. x and z could be externally connected (EC), meaning they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
3. x and z could partially overlap (PO).
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP).
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).
6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi).
7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi).
8. x and z could be equal (EQ).

Let's think about each of these possibilities to see which ones are actually possible given our constraints:

1. DC(x,z): This seems possible. Both x and z are inside y, but they don't have to overlap.
2. EC(x,z): This seems possible. Both x and z are inside y, and they could touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): This seems possible. Both x and z are inside y, and they could partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a part of z and touches z's boundary. This seems possible, as both x and z are inside y, and x could be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems possible, as both x and z are inside y, and x could be a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a part of x and touches x's boundary. This seems possible, as both x and z are inside y, and z could be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This seems possible, as both x and z are inside y, and z could be a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. This seems possible, as both x and z are inside y, and they could be the same region.

But wait, I need to more carefully consider the constraints. NTPP(x,y) means x is strictly inside y, and NTPPi(y,z) means z is strictly inside y. Let's examine whether there are any other constraints on the relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me reconsider. NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So:
- x is strictly inside y (doesn't touch the boundary)
- z is strictly inside y (doesn't touch the boundary)

So both x and z are strictly inside y. This doesn't impose any further constraints on their relationship. They could be disconnected, connected, overlapping, or one could be a part of the other. Let's double-check each of the relations to see if any of them are impossible:

1. DC(x,z): Both x and z are inside y, but they could be separate from each other. This is possible.
2. EC(x,z): Both x and z are inside y, and they could touch at their boundaries. This is possible.
3. PO(x,z): Both x and z are inside y, and they could partially overlap. This is possible.
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary, while both are inside y. This is possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a proper part of z that doesn't touch z's boundary, while both are inside y. This is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, while both are inside y. This is possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary, while both are inside y. This is possible.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be the same region, while both are inside y. This is possible.

So, all of the eight relations are possible for x and z given our constraints. Let me re-examine whether there are any subtle constraints that I might have missed.

Actually, I made a misunderstanding. Let me clarify once more:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), so z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- x is strictly inside y (doesn't touch the boundary)
- z is strictly inside y (doesn't touch the boundary)

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

To be precise, both x and z are strictly inside y, meaning they don't touch y's boundary. This doesn't impose any constraints on their relationship to each other. They could be disconnected, touching, overlapping, or one could be part of the other.

So, all eight relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are possible for the relationship between x and z.

Actually, wait, I think I need to reconsider. I need to make sure that the RCC-8 relations are applied correctly to this problem. Let me think step by step.

First, let's make sure I understand the RCC-8 relations correctly:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, i.e., they share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper subset of y and x touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper subset of y and x doesn't touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(y,x).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(y,x).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.

Now, we have NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). This means:
- x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is strictly inside y.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is strictly inside y.

So both x and z are strictly inside y, and neither touches y's boundary. But this doesn't impose any constraints on the relationship between x and z. They could still have any of the eight RCC-8 relations between them, as long as they both remain strictly inside y.

Let me check if any of the relations violate our constraints:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible as long as both are inside y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible as long as both are inside y.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible as long as both are inside y.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible as long as both x and z are inside y.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible as long as both x and z are inside y.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible as long as both x and z are inside y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible as long as both x and z are inside y.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is possible as long as both x and z are inside y.

So my answer is that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z, given our constraints.

Actually, hold on. Let me revisit. TPP(x,z) means x touches the boundary of z. NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch the boundary of y. If x touches the boundary of z, and z is strictly inside y, then x might touch the boundary of y if z's boundary is right up against y's boundary at some point. But this would contradict NTPP(x,y).

Similarly, if TPPi(x,z), then z touches the boundary of x. If x is strictly inside y, and z touches the boundary of x, then z might touch the boundary of y if x's boundary is right up against y's boundary at some point. But this would contradict NTPPi(y,z).

So both TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) might lead to contradictions in some cases.

Actually, wait, I misunderstood something. If TPP(x,z), then x touches the boundary of z. This doesn't necessarily mean x touches the boundary of y. Even if z is strictly inside y, x touching the boundary of z just means x touches the boundary of z, not the boundary of y. So TPP(x,z) doesn't contradict NTPP(x,y).

Similarly, if TPPi(x,z), then z touches the boundary of x. This doesn't necessarily mean z touches the boundary of y. Even if x is strictly inside y, z touching the boundary of x just means z touches the boundary of x, not the boundary of y. So TPPi(x,z) doesn't contradict NTPPi(y,z).

So it seems like all eight relations are still possible. Let me double-check if there are any subtle constraints I'm missing.

Actually, one last check to make sure I'm being careful. Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can we have TPP(x,z)?

TPP(x,z) means:
1. x is a proper part of z.
2. x touches the boundary of z.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Wait, there's another misunderstanding. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. It doesn't mean y is a proper part of z.

So we have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Both x and z are proper parts of y and don't touch the boundary of y. This doesn't impose any specific constraint on the relationship between x and z; they could have any of the eight RCC-8 relations.

Actually, let me check if there are any implications for TPP(x,z) given the above.

TPP(x,z) means:
1. x is a proper part of z.
2. x touches the boundary of z.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x needs to touch the boundary of z. But since both x and z are strictly inside y (i.e., they don't touch the boundary of y), touching the boundary of z doesn't imply touching the boundary of y. So TPP(x,z) doesn't contradict our given constraints.

Similarly, TPPi(x,z) doesn't contradict our given constraints either.

So, after careful consideration, all eight RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are possible for the relationship between x and z, given our constraints.

Actually, I think we have to consider the composition of NTPP and NTPPi, i.e., NTPP ∘ NTPPi. This composition gives the possible relations between x and z. Let me think this through.

NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y). 

The question is: what are the possible relationships between x and z when both are non-tangential proper parts of y?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are disjoint regions inside y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap, all while being inside y.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other, all while being inside y.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is a proper subset of z and touches z's boundary, all while both are inside y.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is a proper subset of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, all while both are inside y.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is a proper subset of x and touches x's boundary, all while both are inside y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is a proper subset of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, all while both are inside y.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is possible if x and z are the same region inside y.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations seem possible for the relationship between x and z given our constraints.

Wait, let me double-check by considering each case and visualizing to make sure it's consistent with our constraints.

1. DC(x,z): Both x and z are separate regions strictly inside y. ✓
2. EC(x,z): Both x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap, and both are strictly inside y. ✓
3. PO(x,z): Both x and z partially overlap, and both are strictly inside y. ✓
4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z and touches z's boundary, and both x and z are strictly inside y. ✓
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and both x and z are strictly inside y. ✓
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x and touches x's boundary, and both x and z are strictly inside y. ✓
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and both x and z are strictly inside y. ✓
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region, and both are strictly inside y. ✓

Yes, all eight relations are possible.

Actually, wait, I'm curious about the formal composition of NTPP ∘ NTPPi in the RCC-8 calculus. Let me try to derive it.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), what are the possible relations between x and z?

Actually, I think there's a misunderstanding. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), not NTPP(y,z). So NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

The question is: what are the possible relationships between x and z when both are non-tangential proper parts of y?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are disjoint regions inside y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap, all while being inside y.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other, all while being inside y.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is a proper subset of z and touches z's boundary, all while both are inside y.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is a proper subset of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, all while both are inside y.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is a proper subset of x and touches x's boundary, all while both are inside y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is a proper subset of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, all while both are inside y.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is possible if x and z are the same region inside y.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations seem possible for the relationship between x and z given our constraints.

Actually, I think I misunderstood the problem from the beginning. Let me reclarify.

We are given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Actually, let me check my understanding of NTPPi again.

NTPPi(a,b) means NTPP(b,a), which means b is a non-tangential proper part of a.

So NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Ah, I see the confusion. I initially misinterpreted NTPPi(y,z) as meaning that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. But that's incorrect. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So the given information is:

- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. This means both x and z are strictly inside y and don't touch the boundary of y. Given this, let's see what the possible relationships between x and z are.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are disjoint regions inside y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap, all while being inside y.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other, all while being inside y.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is a proper subset of z and touches z's boundary, all while both are inside y.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is a proper subset of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, all while both are inside y.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is a proper subset of x and touches x's boundary, all while both are inside y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is a proper subset of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, all while both are inside y.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is possible if x and z are the same region inside y.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given our constraints.

Actually, I realize I'm not making much progress. Let me try to look at the problem from a different angle. I want to see if the composition of NTPP and NTPP (or, in our case, NTPP and NTPPi) in the RCC-8 calculus leads to a specific set of relations. But instead of trying to derive it from first principles, let me try to visualize some examples.

Example 1: Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, and they are disconnected (DC). This is certainly possible.

Example 2: Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, and they are externally connected (EC). This is also possible. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points, all while being inside y.

Example 3: Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, and they partially overlap (PO). This is possible. They share some interior points but neither is a subset of the other, all while being inside y.

Example 4: Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, and x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP). This is possible. x is a proper subset of z and touches z's boundary, all while both are inside y.

Example 5: Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, and x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP). This is possible. x is a proper subset of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, all while both are inside y.

Example 6: Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, and z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi). This is possible. z is a proper subset of x and touches x's boundary, all while both are inside y.

Example 7: Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, and z is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi). This is possible. z is a proper subset of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, all while both are inside y.

Example 8: Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, and they are equal (EQ). This is possible. They are the same region inside y.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations seem possible for the relationship between x and z given our constraints.

Actually, I'm getting lost in the visualization. Let me try again. We have NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

Actually, wait, let me be really careful here. The problem statement says "NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y)." So NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

However, I need to be clear about the RCC-8 composition. The composition NTPP ∘ NTPPi gives the possible relations between x and z when there's a y such that NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

But wait, I think I misunderstood the problem from the beginning. Let me be clear about what NTPPi(y,z) means. NTPPi stands for the inverse of NTPP. So:

NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b.
NTPPi(a,b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a, i.e., NTPP(b,a).

So NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., NTPP(z,y).

Given this, let's clarify our constraints:

NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., NTPP(z,y).

So both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. That is, both x and z are strictly inside y and don't touch the boundary of y.

Given this constraint, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

I'm fairly convinced that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given our constraints.

Let me see if there's a more formal approach to this. The composition of NTPP and NTPPi in the RCC-8 calculus might give us the answer directly.

Actually, we're computing the composition NTPP ∘ NTPPi^-1, which is the same as NTPP ∘ NTPP.

Let's write this out explicitly. We want to find all possible relationships R(x,z) such that:

NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y)

For each of the RCC-8 relations, let's check if it's possible for R(x,z):

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Can this be true when both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y? Yes, x and z can be disjoint regions inside y. Example: Let y be a circle, and let x and z be two smaller, non-touching circles inside y, away from y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected. Can this be true when both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y? Yes, x and z can touch at their boundaries while being inside y. Example: Let y be a circle, and let x and z be two smaller circles inside y that touch at a point, both away from y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Can this be true when both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y? Yes, x and z can overlap while being inside y. Example: Let y be a circle, and let x and z be two smaller circles inside y that overlap but neither is inside the other, both away from y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Can this be true when both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y? Yes, x can be inside z and touch z's boundary, all while both are inside y. Example: Let y be a circle, let z be a smaller circle inside y away from y's boundary, and let x be an even smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary but is away from y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Can this be true when both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y? Yes, x can be strictly inside z, all while both are inside y. Example: Let y be a circle, let z be a smaller circle inside y away from y's boundary, and let x be an even smaller circle strictly inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Can this be true when both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y? Yes, z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, all while both are inside y. Example: Let y be a circle, let x be a smaller circle inside y away from y's boundary, and let z be an even smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary but is away from y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Can this be true when both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y? Yes, z can be strictly inside x, all while both are inside y. Example: Let y be a circle, let x be a smaller circle inside y away from y's boundary, and let z be an even smaller circle strictly inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. Can this be true when both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y? Yes, x and z can be the same region inside y. Example: Let y be a circle, and let x and z be the same smaller circle inside y away from y's boundary.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given our constraints.

Let me make sure that the examples I provided are consistent with the properties of the RCC-8 relations.

The properties of RCC-8 relations are:

1. They are mutually exclusive: A pair of regions can satisfy only one of the eight relations.
2. They are exhaustive: A pair of regions must satisfy at least one of the eight relations.
3. Each relation has an inverse. For example, the inverse of TPP is TPPi, the inverse of NTPP is NTPPi, and the inverses of DC, EC, PO, and EQ are themselves.

Now, let's check if the examples I provided are consistent with these properties:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disjoint regions inside y, away from y's boundary. This is consistent with the definition of DC.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a point, both away from y's boundary. This is consistent with the definition of EC.
3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap but neither is inside the other, both away from y's boundary. This is consistent with the definition of PO.
4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary, both away from y's boundary. This is consistent with the definition of TPP.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is strictly inside z, both away from y's boundary. This is consistent with the definition of NTPP.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary, both away from y's boundary. This is consistent with the definition of TPPi.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is strictly inside x, both away from y's boundary. This is consistent with the definition of NTPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region inside y, away from y's boundary. This is consistent with the definition of EQ.

All of these examples are consistent with the properties of the RCC-8 relations. And in each case, both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, which is consistent with our given constraints.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z when NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me just do one quick sanity check. When we say NTPP(x,y), we mean x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is strictly inside y. Similarly, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is strictly inside y. So both x and z are strictly inside y.

Now let's check if TPP(x,z) is possible under these constraints. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. Can this be true when both x and z are strictly inside y? Yes, as long as x and z are both strictly inside y, x can touch the boundary of z without touching the boundary of y. This is similar for all other relations.

So, after careful consideration, I believe that all eight RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are possible for the relationship between x and z when NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Alright, I think I've established that all eight relations are possible, so my final answer is:

The possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

Given the information:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

So both x and z are completely inside y, not touching y's boundary. I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let me check each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected regions inside y
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries while both are inside y
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap while both are inside y
4. TPP(x,z): x can be inside z touching z's boundary (both still inside y)
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary
6. TPPi(x,z): z can be inside x touching x's boundary
7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary
8. EQ(x,z): x and z can be identical regions inside y

All eight relations are possible since the only constraint is that both x and z must be non-tangential proper parts of y.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
