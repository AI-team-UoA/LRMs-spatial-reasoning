PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the constraints:
1. DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts
2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some spatial part, but neither is contained in the other

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since DC(x,y), we know that x has no shared part with y. 
Since PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some part, but also have parts that are not shared.

For x and z, we need to consider all eight possible RCC-8 relations and determine which are consistent with our constraints:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
This is certainly possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and only part of z overlaps with y, it's perfectly possible for x to be completely disconnected from z as well.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected (touching at boundary)
This is possible. x could be disconnected from y but touch the boundary of z in a region where z does not overlap with y.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
This is possible. x could overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
This is possible. x could be entirely within z but touching z's boundary, as long as x doesn't overlap with the part of z that overlaps with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
This is possible. x could be entirely within the interior of z, as long as x doesn't overlap with the part of z that overlaps with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
This is possible. z could be entirely within x and touching x's boundary, as long as the part of z that overlaps with y is only at the boundary of x, not in the interior (since x and y must be disconnected).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
This is possible. z could be entirely within the interior of x, as long as the part of z that overlaps with y is completely contained within x (and doesn't touch x's boundary).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
This is possible. x and z could be identical, as long as the part of z that overlaps with y is only at the boundary of x, not in the interior.

Actually, I need to reconsider some of these. Let me think more carefully about each case.

1. DC(x,z) - Clearly possible as I described.

2. EC(x,z) - This is possible. x can touch z at its boundary in regions where z doesn't overlap with y.

3. PO(x,z) - This is possible. x can overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z) - This requires x to be entirely contained in z. This is possible as long as x is in parts of z that don't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Similar to TPP, this is possible as long as x is in parts of z that don't overlap with y.

For cases 6-8, I need to be more careful:

6. TPPi(x,z) - This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. But since PO(y,z), y and z share some part. If z is entirely in x, and z shares a part with y, then x and y would also share that part, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is entirely contained in the interior of x. Again, since PO(y,z), y and z share some part, which would make x and y share that part too, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - This means x and z are identical. Since PO(y,z), y and z share some part, which would make x and y share that part too, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning about TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

For TPPi(x,z), if z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely contained in x. Since PO(y,z), y and z share some part. This part would also be part of x, making x and y share that part, which contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) and EQ(x,z), since z shares a part with y (from PO(y,z)), and in both these cases z is contained in x, x would share a part with y, contradicting DC(x,y).

So my conclusion stands: the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me think once more about this to make sure my reasoning is correct.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some points, but neither is contained in the other)

For x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   This is consistent with our constraints. x can be completely separated from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
   This is consistent. x can touch z at its boundary in a region where z doesn't overlap with y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is consistent as long as the overlap between x and z doesn't include any part of y (since x and y must be disconnected).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is consistent as long as x is contained in a part of z that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is consistent as long as x is contained in a part of z that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   If z is entirely contained in x, and z shares a part with y (from PO(y,z)), then x would also share that part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Similar to TPPi, this would require x to share a part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   If x and z are identical, and z shares a part with y, then x would also share that part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

That's our final answer.

Wait, let me reconsider the case of TPPi. TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. Since PO(y,z), y and z share some part. But this part doesn't have to be all of z. So it's possible that the part of z that overlaps with y is outside of x, while the rest of z is inside x, making z tangential to x's boundary. But actually, this doesn't work either, because for TPPi(x,z), all of z must be inside x. If any part of z is outside x, then z is not a proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

To be very careful, let me revisit each case once more, this time being more precise about the regions.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some points, but neither is contained in the other)

Let's denote the region shared by y and z as (y ∩ z).

For x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   This is consistent because x can be completely separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
   This is consistent because x can touch z at its boundary in a region where z doesn't overlap with y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is consistent as long as the overlap between x and z doesn't include any part of (y ∩ z).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is consistent as long as x is contained in a part of z that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is consistent as long as x is contained in a part of z that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   For this to be true, all of z must be contained in x. But since PO(y,z), z shares a part with y, which would make x share that part with y too, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Similar to TPPi, this would require all of z to be in x, which would make x share a part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   If x and z are identical, and z shares a part with y, then x would also share that part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This confirms our previous conclusion.

Actually, wait, let me reconsider the case of PO(x,z). For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some part, but neither is contained in the other. Since PO(y,z), y and z share some part. If x and z share a part, and z and y share a part, does that mean x and y must share a part? Not necessarily. The part of z that overlaps with x can be different from the part that overlaps with y.

So PO(x,z) is indeed possible, as long as the part of z that overlaps with x doesn't overlap with y.

Let me go through the reasoning once more to be completely sure:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some points, but neither is contained in the other)

For each of the eight RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   This is consistent. x can be completely separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
   This is consistent. x can touch z at its boundary in a region where z doesn't overlap with y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is consistent as long as the part of z that overlaps with x doesn't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is consistent as long as x is contained in a part of z that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is consistent as long as x is contained in a part of z that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   For this to be true, all of z must be contained in x. But since PO(y,z), z shares a part with y. If all of z is in x, then x must also share that part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Similar to TPPi, this would require all of z to be in x, which would make x share a part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   If x and z are identical, and z shares a part with y, then x would also share that part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So the answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), I'll analyze each potential relation:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some points, but neither is contained in the other)

Analyzing each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be completely separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z at its boundary in a region where z doesn't overlap with y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be contained in z (touching z's boundary) as long as x is in parts of z that don't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely contained within z as long as x is in parts of z that don't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a proper part of x (touching x's boundary), then since z shares parts with y (from PO(y,z)), x would also share parts with y, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Similar to TPPi, if z were completely inside x, then x would share parts with y, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then x would share parts with y (since z does), contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
