{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "The RCC-8 calculus has specific properties for composition of relations.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)\n- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident\n\nThe EQ relation is transitive, meaning that if x equals y and y equals z, then x must equal z.\n\nSince x and y are the same region, and y and z are the same region, then x and z must also be the same region.\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 6.4807634353637695, "reasoning-tokens": 402, "completion-tokens": 402}
