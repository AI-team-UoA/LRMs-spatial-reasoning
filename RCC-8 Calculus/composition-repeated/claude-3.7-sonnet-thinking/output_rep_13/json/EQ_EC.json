{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Let me analyze the given information:\n\n1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space\n2. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points\n\nSince x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), they have identical spatial properties - same interior, same boundary, and same exterior. Therefore, x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z.\n\nSince y is externally connected to z (EC(y,z)), x must also be externally connected to z.\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 7.566814422607422, "reasoning-tokens": 394, "completion-tokens": 394}
