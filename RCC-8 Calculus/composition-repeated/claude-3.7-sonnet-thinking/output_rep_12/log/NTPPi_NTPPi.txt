PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what NTPPi(x,y) means. NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. In other words, y is fully contained within the interior of x.

Similarly, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary. So z is fully contained within the interior of y.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. We know that:
- y is fully contained within the interior of x.
- z is fully contained within the interior of y.

From these two facts, we can deduce that z is also fully contained within the interior of x. This is because if z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z must be inside x.

To be more formal: If z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary, and y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary, then z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.

This means that NTPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check this. 

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z is also a proper part of x. Moreover, since z does not touch y's boundary, and y does not touch x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary. So z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me test this with a concrete example to be sure. Imagine:
- x is a large circle
- y is a medium circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- z is a small circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)

In this case, z is indeed completely inside x and not touching x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x).

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, actually let me double check once more because I realized that I made an error in my reasoning. Let's be careful about the direction.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

From these, we can infer that:
- x contains y in its interior (without y touching x's boundary).
- y contains z in its interior (without z touching y's boundary).

Therefore, x contains z in its interior (without z touching x's boundary). This means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

This confirms that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize I'm not being as rigorous as I could be in my reasoning. Let me think about this more carefully.

NTPPi(x,y) means that x properly contains y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. In other words, y is entirely within the interior of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y. In other words, z is entirely within the interior of y.

Given these, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

1. Since y is properly contained in x, and z is properly contained in y, it follows that z is properly contained in x by transitivity.

2. Since z is in the interior of y (doesn't touch y's boundary), and y is in the interior of x (doesn't touch x's boundary), it follows that z is in the interior of x (doesn't touch x's boundary).

Therefore, x properly contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

This confirms once more that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Ok, I think I'm being a bit careless here. Let me think about this problem from first principles. Let me refer to the original definitions.

RCC-8 has 8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means z is a part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Let's check each possible relationship for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know z is a part of y, and y is a part of x. So z must be a part of x, which means x and z cannot be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Again, since z is a part of y, and y is a part of x, z must be a part of x. So x and z must share interior parts, and EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. However, we know z is a part of y, and y is a part of x, so z must be a part of x. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a part of z and touches z's boundary. But we know y is a part of x, and z is a part of y. So x cannot be a part of z, and TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, since y is a part of x, and z is a part of y, x cannot be a part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is the same as TPP(z,x), meaning z is a part of x and touches x's boundary. We know z is a part of y, and y is a part of x, so z is a part of x. But does z touch x's boundary? We know z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary. So z is separated from x's boundary by at least the region of y minus z. Hence, z cannot touch x's boundary, and TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is the same as NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. As established in the previous point, z is a part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But we know z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. So z must be a proper part of x, and they cannot be coincident. Hence, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

From the above analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake in my reasoning, since I have been a bit careless in writing it out. 

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

From these, I can infer:
1. y is completely contained within the interior of x, and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. z is completely contained within the interior of y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, z must be inside x. And since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z doesn't touch x's boundary. 

Therefore, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I think I'm mistaken in my reasoning. Let me think about this from first principles yet again.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to find the possible relationships between x and z based on the RCC-8 calculus. 

For the possible relationships between x and z, let's consider each RCC-8 relationship:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? No, because z is a part of y, and y is a part of x, so z must be a part of x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. Is this possible? No, because z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, so z must be separated from x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Is this possible? No, because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x, not just partially overlapping.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? No, because y is a proper part of x, and z is a proper part of y, so x cannot be a part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this possible? No, same reason as above.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible? No, because z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, so z cannot touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x. Also, z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, so z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. Is this possible? No, because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x.

From the above analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me actually think about this more carefully, and try to see if there's any way that any other relationship could hold between x and z.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): This would mean that x and z don't share any spatial parts. But z is a part of y, and y is a part of x, so z is a part of x. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Since z is a part of y, and y is a part of x, z is a part of x and shares interior parts with x. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean that x and z partially overlap, where they share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other. But we know z is a part of y, and y is a part of x, so z is a part of x. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. But y is a proper part of x, and z is a proper part of y, so x cannot be a part of z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, since y is a proper part of x, and z is a proper part of y, x cannot be a part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. We know z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x. But does z touch x's boundary? We know z doesn't touch y's boundary (because NTPPi(y,z)), and y doesn't touch x's boundary (because NTPPi(x,y)). So z is separated from x's boundary by at least the region of y minus z. Hence, z cannot touch x's boundary, and TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. From the reasoning in point 6, z is indeed a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are coincident. But z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z must be a proper part of x, not equal to x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, out of all the RCC-8 relationships, only NTPPi(x,z) is possible when NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) are true.

Therefore, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me take a step back and think about whether I'm being silly here. 

I want to be sure I understand the meanings of TPP and NTPP, which I think I'm confusing.

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let me define what "proper part" means: a proper part is a part that is not the whole. So if x is a proper part of y, then x is a subset of y, but x is not equal to y.

With that understanding:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given those:

1. z is a proper part of y (z is a subset of y, but z is not equal to y).
2. y is a proper part of x (y is a subset of x, but y is not equal to x).

From 1 and 2, by transitivity, z is a proper part of x (z is a subset of x, but z is not equal to x).

3. z doesn't touch y's boundary.
4. y doesn't touch x's boundary.

From 3 and 4, and considering that z is inside y and y is inside x, z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

To be super explicit, let me try and picture the constraints.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, y is completely contained within the interior of x, with a margin between y and the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So, z is completely contained within the interior of y, with a margin between z and the boundary of y.

Given these constraints, where is z in relation to x? Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, z is inside x. Moreover, since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z is separated from x's boundary by at least the margin between y and x's boundary. So, z is completely contained within the interior of x, with a margin between z and the boundary of x.

This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, yet again, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reason this through one more time.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is a subset of x, but y is not equal to x) and y doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y (i.e., z is a subset of y, but z is not equal to y) and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, for the relationship between x and z, let's examine each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? No, because z is a subset of y, and y is a subset of x, so z is a subset of x, which means they share spatial parts.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts). Is this possible? No, because z is a subset of y, and y is a subset of x, so z is a subset of x, which means they share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (share some interior parts, but neither is a subset of the other). Is this possible? No, because z is a subset of y, and y is a subset of x, so z is a subset of x, which means z is entirely contained within x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? No, because y is a proper part of x, and z is a proper part of y, so x cannot be a subset of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this possible? No, for the same reason as above.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible? We know z is a proper part of x (from transitivity). But does z touch x's boundary? We know z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary. So z is separated from x's boundary by at least the region of y minus z. Hence, z cannot touch x's boundary, and TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Is this possible? From the reasoning in point 6, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal). Is this possible? No, because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x, not equal to x.

From the above analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, is NTPP really defined as not touching the boundary? Let me go back to the original definition in the problem statement.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So yes, NTPP is indeed defined as not touching the boundary. 

Actually, after reviewing the problem statement, the relationships are defined as:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

So, for NTPPi(x,y), it means NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

For the relationship between x and z, I've analyzed each RCC-8 relation and found that only NTPPi(x,z) is possible. This means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which aligns with our understanding that z is part of y, y is part of x, and z is separated from x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think of a more concrete example to double check. Imagine:
- x is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z is an even smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Given this arrangement:
- NTPPi(x,y) holds because y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) holds because z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

What's the relationship between x and z? Clearly, z is a part of x (since z is inside y, and y is inside x). Also, z doesn't touch x's boundary (since z doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Let's reason this through using a different concrete example, just to be sure.

Imagine:
- x is the Earth.
- y is a country completely within the Earth (let's say, Switzerland).
- z is a city completely within the country (let's say, Zurich).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y (Switzerland) is part of x (Earth) and doesn't touch x's boundary (the surface of the Earth).
- NTPPi(y,z): z (Zurich) is part of y (Switzerland) and doesn't touch y's boundary (the border of Switzerland).

What's the relationship between x and z? Clearly, z (Zurich) is a part of x (Earth) since z is within y, and y is within x. Also, z doesn't touch x's boundary (the surface of the Earth) since z is completely within y, and y doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) holds.

Ok, so after thinking about this from multiple angles, I am completely convinced that the answer is:

NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me understand what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Now, let's analyze what this tells us about x and z:
1. Since z is a proper part of y (z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
2. And y is a proper part of x (y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary)
3. By transitivity, z must be a proper part of x
4. Also, z cannot touch x's boundary because:
   - z doesn't touch y's boundary
   - y doesn't touch x's boundary
   - So z is separated from x's boundary by at least the space between y's boundary and x's boundary

Therefore, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is exactly the definition of NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
