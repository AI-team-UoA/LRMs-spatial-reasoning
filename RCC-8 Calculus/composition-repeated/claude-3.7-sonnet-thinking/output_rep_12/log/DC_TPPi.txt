PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We have two given relations:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we want to determine the possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z.

Since DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't even touch.
Since TPP(z,y), z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Let's consider the possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. Since z is contained within y and x is disconnected from y, x can be disconnected from z as well.

2. EC(x,z): This might be possible if x touches z at z's boundary point that also lies on y's boundary. Since z touches y's boundary (because TPP(z,y)), and x is disconnected from y, x can touch z at this boundary point while still being disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z): This doesn't seem possible. If x and z partially overlap, then x and y would share some parts (the overlapping parts with z), which contradicts DC(x,y).

4. TPP(x,z): This doesn't seem possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x would be contained within z, which is contained within y. This would mean x is a part of y, which contradicts DC(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is also not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z would be contained within x. But z is also contained within y. This would mean x and y share at least the part that contains z, which contradicts DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is also not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are coincident, then x would be part of y (since z is part of y), which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, after this analysis, it seems the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check the EC(x,z) possibility. We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

Can x and z touch at a boundary (EC) while x and y remain disconnected (DC)? If z touches y's boundary, and x touches z at this boundary point, would x and y still be disconnected?

Actually, I think there's a mistake in my reasoning. If x touches z at z's boundary, and that boundary point is also on y's boundary, then x would also touch y at that point. This would make the relation between x and y EC, not DC. Since we're given that DC(x,y), x cannot touch z at any point that's on y's boundary.

However, if z touches y's boundary at some point p, and x touches z at a different point q (which is on z's boundary but not on y's boundary), then x and y could still be disconnected. But wait, if z is tangentially part of y, then the entire boundary of z is either within y or on y's boundary. If x touches z, it would either touch z at a point that's inside y (which contradicts DC(x,y)) or at a point on y's boundary (which would make the relation between x and y EC, not DC).

So, after reconsidering, I think only DC(x,z) is possible.

But wait, let's be even more careful. TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is contained within y and touches y's boundary from the inside. The boundary of z can be divided into two parts: one part that coincides with y's boundary, and the other part that's inside y.

If x touches z at a point on z's boundary that's inside y, then x would intrude into y, which contradicts DC(x,y).

If x touches z at a point on z's boundary that's also on y's boundary, then x would touch y at that point, which would make the relation between x and y EC, not DC.

So, after careful consideration, I don't think EC(x,z) is possible while maintaining DC(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, actually, wait. Let me be even more careful.

We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, so they share no spatial parts and don't touch.
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, since x is disconnected from y, it means x is outside of y. And since z is contained within y, x is also outside of z. This implies x and z don't share any spatial parts.

But the question now is: can x and z touch at a boundary? If z touches y's boundary from the inside (which it does because TPP(z,y)), and x is outside of y, can x and z touch at a common point on y's boundary?

If x and z touch at a point, that point must be on y's boundary (since z touches y's boundary and x is outside of y). But if x touches a point on y's boundary, then x and y would be in the EC relation, not DC. Since we're given that DC(x,y), x cannot touch any point on y's boundary.

So, x and z cannot touch, which means they are disconnected. Therefore, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let's be even more precise. For the EC relation:

EC(a,b) means that a and b touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

For TPP(z,y), this means z is contained within y and touches y's boundary from the inside. The boundary points of z that coincide with y's boundary are still part of both z and y.

For DC(x,y), this means x and y share no spatial parts, not even boundary points.

Given that x and y don't share any spatial parts, and the boundary points of z that are also boundary points of y are part of both z and y, x cannot touch these boundary points of z (because otherwise, x would also touch y, contradicting DC(x,y)).

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

But wait, let me consider this from a different angle. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is contained within y and touches y's boundary from the inside.

Now, imagine y as a donut and z as a smaller circle inside the donut that touches the inner boundary of the donut. Then, x could be in the hole of the donut. In this scenario, x and y are disconnected (DC), but x and z could potentially touch at the inner boundary of the donut, making the relation between x and z EC.

But is this possible within the context of the RCC-8 calculus? The RCC-8 calculus traditionally deals with regions in Euclidean space, where regions are considered to be regular closed sets. In this context, a donut-shaped region (a region with a hole) is not typically considered.

Actually, TPP(z,y) implies z is a tangential proper part of y. In the standard interpretation of the RCC-8 calculus, y would be a simply connected region (no holes), and z would be a smaller region inside y that touches y's boundary from the inside.

Given this interpretation, if x is disconnected from y, then x is outside of y, and z is inside y. In this case, x and z cannot touch, so the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, I think I might be making a mistake. I should not assume any specific shape for y. Let's start from the definitions and the given information only:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is part of y, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z. This is because if x shared any part with z, it would also share that part with y (since z is part of y), which would contradict DC(x,y).

However, could x and z touch at a boundary? If they did, then this boundary point would be on the boundary of z. But since z is part of y, this boundary point would either be inside y or on the boundary of y. If it's inside y, then x would intrude into y, contradicting DC(x,y). If it's on the boundary of y, then x would touch y at this point, contradicting DC(x,y). 

So, x and z cannot touch at a boundary, and they cannot share any parts. This means the relation between x and z must be DC(x,z).

Actually, I'm getting a bit confused because I'm trying to imagine specific shapes, which might be misleading. Let's focus on the logical implications of the given relations.

RCC-8 uses a first-order logic approach to define relations, so I should consider the definitions and the logical entailments:

DC(x,y) means there are no common points between x and y:
∀p: ¬(p ∈ x ∧ p ∈ y)

TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and shares some boundary points with y:
∀p: (p ∈ z) → (p ∈ y) ∧ ∃p: (p ∈ ∂z ∧ p ∈ ∂y) ∧ ¬(∀p: (p ∈ y) → (p ∈ z))

Given these, if z is part of y, and x shares no points with y, then x cannot share any points with z. This is because any point in z is also in y, and if x had a common point with z, it would also have a common point with y, contradicting DC(x,y).

So, the relation between x and z must be DC(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think the issue I was getting hung up on is that I was imagining a donut shape for y, which is possible in RCC-8. But in that case, if TPP(z,y), the situation changes a bit.

The essential point is this: if z is a tangential proper part of y, then z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary from the inside. Given that x is disconnected from y, which means x is either completely outside of y or in a hole of y, x and z can only be disconnected.

If x is completely outside of y, then it's clear that x and z are disconnected.

If x is in a hole of y, then y surrounds x, but they don't touch or share any parts. In this case, z, being a part of y, cannot reach into the hole to touch x, because that would violate DC(x,y). So, x and z are disconnected in this case as well.

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(z,y), no point that's part of z can also be part of x, and no point on the boundary of z can also be on the boundary of x. This means x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).

But, hmm, let's check some more. If z is tangentially part of y (TPP(z,y)), then it means z touches y's boundary. This implies that at least one point on the boundary of z is also on the boundary of y. Let's call this point p. But since DC(x,y), point p cannot be in x. Furthermore, if point p was in x, then x and y would share a common boundary point, contradicting the fact that they are disconnected.

So, after considering all possibilities, I believe the relation between x and z must be DC(x,z).

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let's rely on the basic composition table for RCC-8 to determine the possible relations between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

To use the composition table, we need to find the composition of DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's identify the entries in the composition table for the composition of DC and TPPi:
DC ∘ TPPi = ?

According to the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of DC and TPPi yields DC. This means if DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then DC(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

So, based on the composition table for RCC-8, the relation between x and z must be DC(x,z).

To double-check, we can reason as follows: DC(x,y) means x and y don't share any spatial parts and don't touch. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is contained within y and touches y's boundary. Given that x is disconnected from y, and z is within y, x must also be disconnected from z.

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is only DC(x,z).

Actually, let's more carefully use the composition table for RCC-8. We have:

DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z)

We need to determine the possible values for R(x, z) by looking at the composition of DC and TPPi. Using the standard composition table for RCC-8, we find:

DC ∘ TPPi = DC

So, if DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), then DC(x, z) is the only possible relation.

For a sanity check, let's think about it intuitively:
TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), so z is a tangential proper part of y.
Given DC(x, y), x is disconnected from y.
If z is inside y and x is outside y (or separated from y), then x must be separated from z as well.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

Let me just verify this by looking at the RCC-8 composition table one more time.

Actually, wait. Let me be careful. I think the composition table gives us the possible relations, not the definite relation. So, when the composition table says DC ∘ TPPi = DC, it means the relation between x and z could be DC, but there might be other possibilities.

Let me reason through this once more:
DC(x, y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given that z is completely within y (as TPP(z, y) means), and x is completely outside of y (as DC(x, y) means), x must also be completely outside of z. This makes the relation between x and z DC.

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is only DC(x, z).

Actually, in looking at the composition table for RCC-8, the entry for DC ∘ TPPi should give all the possible relations that can hold between x and z when DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z). I was a bit uncertain, so let me double-check this using the definition of composition:

The composition R₁ ∘ R₂ gives the set of all possible relations R₃ such that there exists a region y with R₁(x, y) and R₂(y, z).

So, DC ∘ TPPi gives the set of all possible relations R that can hold between x and z when DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z) for some region y.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, DC ∘ TPPi = DC, which means if DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), then DC(x, z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

I'm now confident that the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, I think I should verify the composition table entry for DC ∘ TPPi. Let me use the standard RCC-8 composition table to verify this.

For DC ∘ TPPi, the entry in the RCC-8 composition table should give all the possible relations that can hold between x and z when DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z).

Looking at the standard RCC-8 composition table, the entry for DC ∘ TPPi is DC, which means if DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), then DC(x, z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

So, the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x, z).

Actually, wait a minute. I realized I should be more careful about how I'm handling TPPi. TPPi is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPPi(y, z) is equivalent to TPP(z, y). But when using the composition table, I should use TPPi directly, not its equivalent form.

Let's use the composition table to check DC ∘ TPPi:

For TPPi(y, z):
- y contains z as a tangential proper part.
- z is entirely inside y, and z touches y's boundary.

For DC(x, y):
- x and y are disconnected.
- x and y don't share any spatial parts.

Given these relations, and using the RCC-8 composition table, the entry for DC ∘ TPPi is DC. This confirms that if DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), then DC(x, z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x, z).

On second thought, let me double-check the composition by going back to basic reasoning:

TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary.

DC(x, y) means x and y are disconnected and don't share any spatial parts. This means x is completely outside of y.

Given these, x, being completely outside of y, must also be completely outside of z, since z is inside y. This makes the relation between x and z DC.

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x, z).

Actually, I should check if the relation could be EC(x, z). EC means the regions touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Given that z is inside y and touches y's boundary, and x is outside of y, can x and z touch at a boundary? If they did, this boundary point would be on y's boundary, which would mean x and y touch at that point as well. But this contradicts the fact that DC(x, y). So, x and z cannot be in the EC relation.

Similarly, we can check the other relations:
- PO(x, z): This would mean x and z share some interior parts, which would contradict DC(x, y) since any part of z is also a part of y.
- TPP(x, z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, which would place x inside y, contradicting DC(x, y).
- NTPP(x, z): Similar to TPP, this would place x inside y, contradicting DC(x, y).
- TPPi(x, z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, which would mean z is inside x. But z is also inside y, which would make x and y share some parts, contradicting DC(x, y).
- NTPPi(x, z): Similar to TPPi, this would make x and y share some parts, contradicting DC(x, y).
- EQ(x, z): This would mean x and z are the same, which would place x inside y, contradicting DC(x, y).

So, after checking all the possibilities, the only valid relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

Let's double-check with a concrete diagram. Suppose y is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary. x is another circle outside of y. Given this setup, x and z are clearly disconnected, so the relation is DC(x, z).

Alright, after examining from multiple angles and double-checking with the composition table, the relation between x and z, given DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), is DC(x, z).

Wait, I think I should re-examine the case where y might have holes. Let me ensure I'm not overlooking anything.

In RCC-8, regions are considered to be regular closed sets in a topological space, which means they can have holes. Given DC(x, y), x and y are disconnected, which means they don't share any spatial parts. If y has a hole, x could be in that hole (still satisfying DC(x, y)), or x could be outside of y.

Now, TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary from the inside.

If x is outside of y, then x is also outside of z (since z is inside y), making the relation between x and z DC.

If x is in a hole of y, then x is surrounded by y but doesn't touch or share any parts with y. In this case, z, being a part of y, cannot reach into the hole to touch x, because that would violate the fact that z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary from the inside). So, x and z are disconnected in this case as well.

Therefore, regardless of whether y has holes or not, the relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

Alright, let's wrap up. Given DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x, z).

Actually, I think I'm making things unnecessarily complicated. Let's approach this more directly:

1. TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which means z is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary from the inside.
2. DC(x, y) means x and y are disconnected, so x and y don't share any spatial parts.

Given these, x and z cannot share any spatial parts because z is entirely inside y, and x and y don't share any parts. So, the relation between x and z cannot be PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Could the relation be EC(x, z)? For this to be true, x and z would need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. Given that z touches y's boundary from the inside, and x is outside of y, can x and z touch at a boundary? If they did, this boundary point would be on y's boundary, which would mean x and y touch at that point as well. But this contradicts the fact that DC(x, y). So, x and z cannot be in the EC relation.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

To conclude, given DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x, z).

Actually, one more thing I should double check. Let's consider that y is a ring donut (a torus), z is a smaller ring inside the donut touching the inner boundary of the donut, and x is a ring in the center of the donut, not touching any part of y or z. In this scenario, x and y are disconnected (DC), and z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z, y) or TPPi(y, z)). But is x disconnected from z? It seems so; x and z don't share any spatial parts and don't touch.

This confirms our conclusion: Given DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

Actually, I've been making an error. Let me be clear: in RCC-8, regions are simply connected and without holes. The domain of the RCC-8 is typically regular closed subsets of the plane, which can have holes. 

Given this, let's reconsider the problem with the possibility that y has holes.

If y has a hole and x is in that hole, then DC(x, y) holds (x and y are disconnected). TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), so z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary from the inside.

If z touches the outer boundary of y, then x (being in a hole of y) and z are clearly disconnected, so DC(x, z) holds.

But what if z touches the inner boundary of y (the boundary of the hole where x is)? Since z is inside y, and the inner boundary of y surrounds the hole, z would be on the side of the boundary opposite to x. If z and x were to touch at a point on this boundary, then both x and z would touch the same point on y's boundary, which would make y self-intersect, which doesn't make sense for a region. So, x and z cannot touch, making the relation DC(x, z).

Therefore, given DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

Actually, the answer is simpler than I'm making it. Z is part of Y, and X is disconnected from Y. So X is disconnected from Z. The relation is DC(x, z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z, given DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), is DC(x, z).

Actually, let me check the composition table for RCC-8 to make sure I'm not missing anything:

The composition of DC and TPPi, i.e., DC ∘ TPPi, gives the possible relations between x and z when DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z).

According to the standard RCC-8 composition table, DC ∘ TPPi = DC, which confirms our conclusion: Given DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

In summary, the possible relationship between x and z, given DC(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), is DC(x, z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they share no spatial parts)
- TPPi(y,z): which means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained within y and touches y's boundary)

Given these constraints:
- Since z is entirely contained within y (as TPP(z,y) means)
- And x is completely disconnected from y (shares no parts with y)
- Then x must also be completely disconnected from any part of y, including z

No other relation is possible because:
- If x and z shared any parts or even touched at a boundary, then x would also have to share parts with or touch y
- This would contradict the given DC(x,y) relation

### Answer: DC(x,z)
