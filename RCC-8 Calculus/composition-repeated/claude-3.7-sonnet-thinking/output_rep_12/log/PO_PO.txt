PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem carefully. We have:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. This means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. This means y and z share a spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

We want to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z.

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z by considering how the regions can be arranged:

1. **DC(x,z)**: x and z can be disconnected. This is possible if the overlapping regions of x with y and y with z are separate parts of y.

2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z can be externally connected. This could happen if the part of y that overlaps with x is adjacent to the part of y that overlaps with z.

3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z can partially overlap. This would occur if x and z share some spatial part directly.

4. **TPP(x,z)**: x can be a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x can be a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z without touching its boundary.

6. **TPPi(x,z)**: z can be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)**: z can be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching its boundary.

8. **EQ(x,z)**: x and z can be equal. This is a theoretical possibility, although perhaps unlikely given the constraints.

Let me analyze each of these possibilities to see if they are consistent with the given conditions:

**DC(x,z)**: 
Consider regions where y overlaps with part of x and separately overlaps with part of z, but x and z themselves don't overlap. This is clearly possible.

**EC(x,z)**:
Consider regions where x and z touch at their boundaries, and y overlaps with both x and z. This is possible.

**PO(x,z)**:
Consider regions where x and z partially overlap, and y overlaps with both x and z. This is possible.

**TPP(x,z)**:
Can x be a tangential proper part of z while maintaining PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Yes, this is possible if y overlaps with both x and z, where x is entirely contained within z but touches z's boundary.

**NTPP(x,z)**:
Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z while maintaining PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Yes, this is possible if y overlaps with both x and z, where x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

**TPPi(x,z)**:
Can z be a tangential proper part of x while maintaining PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Yes, this is possible if y overlaps with both x and z, where z is entirely contained within x but touches x's boundary.

**NTPPi(x,z)**:
Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x while maintaining PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Yes, this is possible if y overlaps with both x and z, where z is entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

**EQ(x,z)**:
Can x and z be equal while maintaining PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Yes, this is possible if x and z are the same region, and y overlaps with this region.

I think that all eight relations are possible. Let me double-check by thinking about concrete examples or counterexamples for each case:

**DC(x,z)**:
Consider y as a dumbbell shape, where one end overlaps with x and the other end overlaps with z, but x and z are separated. This confirms DC(x,z) is possible.

**EC(x,z)**:
Consider x and z as adjacent regions that touch at their boundary, with y overlapping portions of both. This confirms EC(x,z) is possible.

**PO(x,z)**:
Consider x and z as overlapping regions, with y overlapping portions of both. This confirms PO(x,z) is possible.

**TPP(x,z)**:
Consider x as a region entirely within z but touching z's boundary, and y overlapping with x and extending beyond z. This confirms TPP(x,z) is possible.

**NTPP(x,z)**:
Consider x as a region entirely within z without touching z's boundary, and y overlapping with x and extending beyond z. This confirms NTPP(x,z) is possible.

**TPPi(x,z)**:
Consider z as a region entirely within x but touching x's boundary, and y overlapping with z and extending beyond x. This confirms TPPi(x,z) is possible.

**NTPPi(x,z)**:
Consider z as a region entirely within x without touching x's boundary, and y overlapping with z and extending beyond x. This confirms NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

**EQ(x,z)**:
Consider x and z as identical regions, with y partially overlapping this common region. This confirms EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are all eight RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me think one more time for each relation, being careful to ensure that we maintain PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) in each case:

**DC(x,z)**:
For PO(x,y), x and y must share some interior points, and neither is contained in the other.
For PO(y,z), y and z must share some interior points, and neither is contained in the other.
If the overlap of x with y is disjoint from the overlap of y with z, then x and z can be disconnected. This is possible.

**EC(x,z)**:
x and z can touch at their boundaries while x overlaps with one part of y and z overlaps with another part of y. This maintains PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) while ensuring EC(x,z).

**PO(x,z)**:
x and z can partially overlap, with y overlapping parts of both x and z. This is consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

**TPP(x,z)**:
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely within z and touch z's boundary. For PO(x,y), y must overlap with x but not contain it. For PO(y,z), y must overlap with z but not be contained in it. This can happen if y extends both inside and outside of z, overlapping with x within z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

**NTPP(x,z)**:
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely within z without touching z's boundary. For PO(x,y), y must overlap with x but not contain it. For PO(y,z), y must overlap with z but not be contained in it. This can happen if y extends both inside and outside of z, overlapping with x deep within z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

**TPPi(x,z)**:
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely within x and touch x's boundary. For PO(x,y), y must overlap with x but not be contained in it. For PO(y,z), y must overlap with z but not contain it. This can happen if y extends both inside and outside of x, overlapping with z within x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

**NTPPi(x,z)**:
For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely within x without touching x's boundary. For PO(x,y), y must overlap with x but not be contained in it. For PO(y,z), y must overlap with z but not contain it. This can happen if y extends both inside and outside of x, overlapping with z deep within x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

**EQ(x,z)**:
For x and z to be equal, they must occupy the exact same space. For PO(x,y), y must overlap with x but neither contains the other. For PO(y,z), y must overlap with z but neither contains the other. Since x = z in this case, both conditions become identical: y must overlap with x/z without containing it or being contained by it. This is possible, so EQ(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions.

I believe all eight relations are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Therefore, the answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me double-check this reasoning by drawing a few simple diagrams mentally:

For DC(x,z):
x is on the left, z is on the right, and y is a long region that extends from left to right, overlapping with both x and z but not enough to make x and z connected. This satisfies PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) while ensuring DC(x,z).

For EC(x,z):
x is on the left, z is on the right, they touch at a point or boundary, and y overlaps with both but doesn't cover their connection point completely. This satisfies PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) while ensuring EC(x,z).

For PO(x,z):
x and z overlap partially, and y overlaps with parts of both x and z. This satisfies PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) while ensuring PO(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
x is inside z and touches z's boundary. y overlaps with x and extends beyond z. This satisfies PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) while ensuring TPP(x,z).

Wait, I need to be more careful here. For TPP(x,z), we need to ensure that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold.

If x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), then:
- For PO(x,y): y must overlap with x but neither contains the other. This means y must extend outside of x.
- For PO(y,z): y must overlap with z but neither contains the other. This means y must extend outside of z.

Since x is inside z, for y to overlap with x and extend outside of z, y must overlap with x in a way that y is neither contained in x nor contains x, and y must also overlap with z in a way that y is neither contained in z nor contains z. 

This seems possible: x is inside z touching z's boundary, y overlaps with a portion of x and extends outside of z. This satisfies both PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Similarly, we can construct examples for NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) that satisfy the constraints.

So, the answer remains: The possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ - all eight RCC-8 relations.

Actually, I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me be even more methodical. For each of the eight possible relations between x and z, I'll check if it's consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z):

1. **DC(x,z)** (x and z are disconnected):
   - For PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - For PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - Consistency: y can overlap with part of x and separately overlap with part of z, with x and z being disconnected. This is possible.

2. **EC(x,z)** (x and z touch at a boundary):
   - For PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - For PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - Consistency: y can overlap with part of x and part of z, with x and z touching at a boundary. This is possible.

3. **PO(x,z)** (x and z partially overlap):
   - For PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - For PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - Consistency: y can overlap with parts of both x and z, which themselves partially overlap. This is possible.

4. **TPP(x,z)** (x is a tangential proper part of z):
   - For PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - For PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - Consistency: x is inside z touching z's boundary. For y to partially overlap with x, y must extend outside of x. For y to partially overlap with z, y must extend outside of z. 
   - So, y must overlap with a portion of x and extend outside of z. This is possible.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** (x is a non-tangential proper part of z):
   - For PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - For PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - Consistency: x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. For y to partially overlap with x, y must extend outside of x. For y to partially overlap with z, y must extend outside of z.
   - So, y must overlap with a portion of x and extend outside of z. This is possible.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** (z is a tangential proper part of x):
   - For PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - For PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - Consistency: z is inside x touching x's boundary. For y to partially overlap with x, y must extend outside of x. For y to partially overlap with z, y must extend outside of z.
   - So, y must overlap with a portion of z and extend outside of x. This is possible.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** (z is a non-tangential proper part of x):
   - For PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - For PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - Consistency: z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. For y to partially overlap with x, y must extend outside of x. For y to partially overlap with z, y must extend outside of z.
   - So, y must overlap with a portion of z and extend outside of x. This is possible.

8. **EQ(x,z)** (x and z are equal):
   - For PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - For PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, neither contains the other.
   - Consistency: Since x = z, both conditions reduce to: y partially overlaps with x/z. This is possible.

Based on this methodical check, all eight RCC-8 relations between x and z are consistent with the given conditions PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Therefore, the answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations can possibly hold between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me check each possible relation systematically:

1. **DC(x,z)**: Possible if y overlaps with part of x and separately overlaps with part of z, without x and z sharing any points (like a dumbbell shape connecting them).

2. **EC(x,z)**: Possible if y overlaps with portions of both x and z, while x and z touch only at their boundaries.

3. **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z partially overlap, with y overlapping parts of both.

4. **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is inside z touching z's boundary, and y overlaps with x while extending outside of z.

5. **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y overlaps with x while extending outside of z.

6. **TPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is inside x touching x's boundary, and y overlaps with z while extending outside of x.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y overlaps with z while extending outside of x.

8. **EQ(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are identical regions, with y partially overlapping this common region.

In each case, we can construct a configuration that maintains PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) while satisfying the relation between x and z.
