PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to consider all possible relationships between x and z given the constraints EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts.
DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Now, let's think through the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is disconnected from y, then x and z could be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. Even though x touches y at the boundary and z is disconnected from y, it's still possible for x to touch z at their boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x could partially overlap with z, even though x only touches y at the boundary and z is disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be contained within z and touch z's boundary, while also touching y at the boundary, and y and z are disconnected.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y at the boundary, and y and z are disconnected.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z could be contained within x and touch x's boundary, while x touches y at the boundary, and y and z are disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z could be fully contained within x without touching x's boundary, while x touches y at the boundary, and y and z are disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This is not possible. If x and y touch at their boundary (EC(x,y)), and y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), then x and z cannot be the same region because x touches y but z does not.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check some of these by thinking about specific examples:

For DC(x,z): Imagine x and y as two touching circles, and z as a circle that's separate from both. Here, x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z): Imagine x and y as two touching circles, and z as a circle that touches x but is separate from y. Here, x and z are externally connected.

For PO(x,z): Imagine x and y as two touching circles, and z as a circle that overlaps with x but is separate from y. Here, x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and y as a circle outside z that touches x at the point where x touches z's boundary. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle fully inside z (not touching z's boundary), and y as a circle that reaches inside z to touch x's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. This scenario seems a bit contrived and might not be physically possible in a 2D space while maintaining the constraints. Let me reconsider...

Actually, for NTPP(x,z), if x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to at least touch z's boundary too, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary, and y as a circle outside x that touches x's boundary at a different point than where z touches it. Here, z is a tangential proper part of x.

For NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y as a circle that touches x's boundary but is separate from z. Here, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, after reconsidering, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z) once more:

For NTPP(x,z), x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. 

Wait, if y touches x's boundary, and x is fully inside z, then y would have to at least touch z's boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let's also double-check TPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

If y touches x's boundary at a point where x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y would have to enter z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So y must touch x's boundary exactly where x touches z's boundary. This seems possible, so TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Now, let's check if there are any other inconsistencies:

For TPPi(x,z), z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

If y touches x's boundary at the same point as z, then y would touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So y must touch x's boundary at a different point than where z touches it. This seems possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

This scenario is consistent with all constraints, so NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For PO(x,z), x and z overlap partially. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

This scenario is consistent as long as y touches x at a part of x's boundary that doesn't overlap with z. This seems possible, so PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at their boundaries. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

This scenario is consistent as long as y touches x at a different part of x's boundary than where x touches z. This seems possible, so EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

For DC(x,z), x and z are disconnected. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

This scenario is consistent, so DC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So, after careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) more carefully: 

For TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

If y touches x at a point where x touches z's boundary, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So y must touch x at a part of x's boundary that doesn't touch z's boundary. But this is impossible because in TPP(x,z), x's entire boundary touches z's boundary. This contradiction means TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Hmm, wait. In TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary, but x's entire boundary might not touch z's boundary. Some parts of x's boundary might be within z and not touch z's boundary.

Considering a concrete example: Imagine z as a circular donut shape (with a hole in the middle), and x as a smaller circle that sits in the hole and touches the inner boundary of z. Now, y could be a circle inside the hole that touches x but doesn't touch z. In this scenario, we have EC(x,y), DC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is actually a valid possibility.

After rechecking all possibilities, the relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, actually the above reasoning for TPP(x,z) was not quite right. Let me reason about this more carefully:

In TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

Now, if x touches z's boundary at point p, and y touches x's boundary at point q (where p and q are different points), then y would have to enter z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, y must touch x's boundary at the same point p where x touches z's boundary.

But if y touches x's boundary at point p, and x touches z's boundary at point p, then y would also touch z's boundary at point p, which contradicts DC(y,z). This contradiction means TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Let's recheck the other possibilities:

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at their boundaries at point p. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary at point q. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

If p and q are the same point, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So p and q must be different points. This seems possible, so EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Actually, let me draw these scenarios out to be clearer:

For TPP(x,z):
x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
y touches x's boundary.
y and z are disconnected.

Let's say x touches z's boundary at point p. And let's say y touches x's boundary at point q.

If p and q are the same point, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

If p and q are different points, then since x is inside z, and y touches x at q (which is not on z's boundary), y would have to enter z to touch x, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So it seems TPP(x,z) is indeed not a valid possibility.

But wait, I need to think about this more carefully. If x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Let's say x touches z's boundary at point p. The rest of x's boundary is inside z.

Now, y touches x's boundary at some point. If this point is p, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). If this point is not p, then y would have to enter z to touch x, which also contradicts DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Let's carefully reason through the other possibilities again:

For DC(x,z):
x and z are disconnected.
x touches y's boundary.
y and z are disconnected.

This is consistent. x can touch y, and both x and y can be disconnected from z.

For EC(x,z):
x and z touch at their boundaries at point p.
x touches y's boundary at point q.
y and z are disconnected.

If p and q are the same point, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So p and q must be different points. This is consistent.

For PO(x,z):
x and z overlap partially.
x touches y's boundary at point q.
y and z are disconnected.

If q is on the part of x's boundary that's also z's boundary, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So q must be on the part of x's boundary that's not z's boundary. This is consistent.

For TPPi(x,z):
z is inside x and touches x's boundary at point p.
x touches y's boundary at point q.
y and z are disconnected.

If p and q are the same point, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So p and q must be different points. This is consistent.

For NTPPi(x,z):
z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
x touches y's boundary at point q.
y and z are disconnected.

This is consistent.

So, after careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually let me go back and think about TPP(x,z) again.  We have:
* EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries
* DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected
* TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let's say x touches z's boundary at point p. The rest of x's boundary is inside z.

Now, given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary at some point, call it q. If q is p, then y would also touch z, contradicting DC(y,z). If q is not p, then q is inside z (since all of x's boundary except for p is inside z). But then y would have to penetrate z to touch x at q, which contradicts DC(y,z). 

So it seems TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

For TPP(x,z) to be valid, we would need a way for y to touch x without touching z and without entering z. But since x is inside z and only touches z's boundary at some point, any part of x's boundary that y could touch either also touches z's boundary (in which case y touches z, contradicting DC(y,z)) or is inside z (in which case y enters z, also contradicting DC(y,z)).

Let me see if I can come up with a concrete example where TPP(x,z) works:

Imagine z as a circular donut (with a hole in the middle), and x as a smaller circle that sits in the hole and touches the inner boundary of z. Now, y could be a circle inside the hole that touches x but doesn't touch z.

Hmm, but in this scenario, x is not a tangential proper part of z because it's not inside z; it's inside the hole of z, which is not part of z.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z (i.e., x is fully contained within z) and x touches the boundary of z.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

If x is fully contained within z and touches the boundary of z at some point p, then the rest of x's boundary is inside z. Now, y touches x's boundary at some point q. If q is p, then y would also touch z, contradicting DC(y,z). If q is not p, then q is inside z, and y would have to enter z to touch x at q, which also contradicts DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Let's double-check the other possibilities once more:

For DC(x,z):
x and z are disconnected.
x touches y's boundary.
y and z are disconnected.

This is consistent. x can touch y, and both x and y can be disconnected from z.

For EC(x,z):
x and z touch at their boundaries at point p.
x touches y's boundary at point q.
y and z are disconnected.

If p and q are the same point, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So p and q must be different points. This is consistent.

For PO(x,z):
x and z overlap partially.
x touches y's boundary at point q.
y and z are disconnected.

If q is on the part of x's boundary that's also z's boundary, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So q must be on the part of x's boundary that's not z's boundary. This is consistent.

For TPPi(x,z):
z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches x's boundary at point p.
x touches y's boundary at point q.
y and z are disconnected.

If p and q are the same point, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So p and q must be different points. This is consistent.

For NTPPi(x,z):
z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
x touches y's boundary at point q.
y and z are disconnected.

This is consistent.

So, after careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, the more I think about it, I'm not sure TPP(x,z) is impossible. Let me try to come up with a concrete example:

Imagine z as a large rectangle, and x as a smaller rectangle inside z that touches z's boundary on the right side. Now, y could be a rectangle to the right of z that touches x at the point where x touches z's boundary.

But wait, if y touches x at the point where x touches z's boundary, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Let's try another configuration:

Imagine z as a large rectangle, and x as a smaller rectangle inside z that touches z's boundary on the right side. Now, y could be a rectangle to the right of both x and z that touches x's right side but doesn't touch z.

But this doesn't work either because if x touches z's boundary on the right side, and y is to the right of z, then y can't touch x without touching z.

It seems like TPP(x,z) indeed contradicts the given constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me actually draw these cases on a 2D plane to convince myself:

Case 1: DC(x,z)
```
  +-----+    +-----+
  |     |    |     |
  |  x  |    |  z  |
  |     |    |     |
  +-----+    +-----+
    |
    | EC
    |
  +-----+
  |     |
  |  y  |
  |     |
  +-----+
```

Case 2: EC(x,z)
```
  +-----+   +-----+
  |     |   |     |
  |  x  |---|  z  |
  |     |   |     |
  +-----+   +-----+
    |
    | EC
    |
  +-----+
  |     |
  |  y  |
  |     |
  +-----+
```

Case 3: PO(x,z)
```
  +-----+-----+
  |     |     |
  |  x  |  z  |
  |     |     |
  +-----+-----+
    |
    | EC
    |
  +-----+
  |     |
  |  y  |
  |     |
  +-----+
```

Case 4: TPP(x,z)

Trying to draw this case:
```
  +-----+
  |     |
  |  z  |
  |     |
  +--+--+
     |
     | x
     |
  +--+--+
  |     |
  |  y  |
  |     |
  +-----+
```

But here, if y touches x, and x touches z's boundary, then y would also touch z, contradicting DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a valid case.

Actually, it seems like the issue is with my ASCII art. Let me try to improve it:

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

```
  +------------+
  |            |
  |   +----+   |
  |   |    |   |
  |   | x  |   |
  |   |    |   |
  |   +----+   |
  |            |
  +------------+
        z
```

Now, given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

```
  +------------+     +-----+
  |            |     |     |
  |   +----+   |     |     |
  |   |    |   |     |     |
  |   | x  |---|-----| y   |
  |   |    |   |     |     |
  |   +----+   |     |     |
  |            |     |     |
  +------------+     +-----+
        z
```

But in this configuration, if y touches x, y would have to enter z, which contradicts DC(y,z). If x is entirely inside z (as in TPP(x,z)), then any object touching x would also have to at least touch z, if not enter it. This contradicts DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not a valid possibility.

Let's also check TPPi(x,z):

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

```
  +------------+
  |            |
  |   +----+   |
  |   |    |   |
  | x | z  |   |
  |   |    |   |
  |   +----+   |
  |            |
  +------------+
```

Now, given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

```
  +------------+     +-----+
  |            |     |     |
  |   +----+   |     |     |
  |   |    |   |     |     |
  | x | z  |   |     |     |
  |   |    |   |     |     |
  |   +----+   |     | y   |
  |            |-----|     |
  +------------+     +-----+
```

This configuration works. y touches x's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying EC(x,y). And y and z are disconnected, satisfying DC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Let's check NTPPi(x,z):

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

```
  +------------+
  |            |
  |   +----+   |
  |   |    |   |
  | x | z  |   |
  |   |    |   |
  |   +----+   |
  |            |
  +------------+
```

Now, given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

```
  +------------+     +-----+
  |            |     |     |
  |   +----+   |     |     |
  |   |    |   |     |     |
  | x | z  |   |     |     |
  |   |    |   |     |     |
  |   +----+   |     | y   |
  |            |-----|     |
  +------------+     +-----+
```

This configuration works. y touches x's boundary, satisfying EC(x,y). And y and z are disconnected, satisfying DC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So, after drawing out the cases, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But let me verify TPP(x,z) once more, just to be sure. The TPP relation states that x is a tangential proper part of z. This means that x is fully inside z, and x touches the boundary of z.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

If x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary, any object touching x's boundary must either also touch z's boundary or enter z. But both of these scenarios contradict DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

Let me also double-check NTPP(x,z), the case where x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

If x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, any object touching x's boundary must enter z. But this contradicts DC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is also not a valid possibility.

After checking all cases, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, my reasoning for PO(x,z) might not be correct either. Let me reconsider:

For PO(x,z), x and z overlap partially. Some parts of x are inside z, and some parts of x are outside z. Similarly, some parts of z are inside x, and some parts of z are outside x.

Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

If y touches x's boundary at a point where x's boundary also forms part of z's boundary, then y would also touch z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So y must touch x's boundary at a point that's not on z's boundary.

If y touches x's boundary at a point that's inside z, then y would have to enter z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So y must touch x's boundary at a point that's outside z.

This is possible. For example, imagine x and z as overlapping circles, and y as a circle that touches x at a point outside z. So, PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Let's verify the other cases once more:

For DC(x,z), x and z are disconnected. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), as seen in the diagrams.

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), as long as y touches x at a different point than where x touches z.

For TPPi(x,z), z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), as long as y touches x at a different point than where z touches x.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

So, after carefully checking all cases, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm now convinced that the answer is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

That is, all relations except for TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are possible.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to examine which of the eight RCC-8 relations can possibly hold between x and z, given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at the boundary while both x and z remain completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z at their boundary while also touching y at a different point on x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can overlap partially, with x touching y at a point on its boundary that lies outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then y would either have to touch z (contradicting DC(y,z)) or penetrate z to reach x (also contradicting DC(y,z)).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would have to penetrate z to touch x, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, while y touches x at a different point on x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while y touches x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are identical, then y would have to touch z since it touches x, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
