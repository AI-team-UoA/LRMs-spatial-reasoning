PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

We need to find all possible relationships between x and z, which could be any of the RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Let's analyze each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   - Since y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), x could be completely outside of z, making DC(x,z) possible.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z touch at their boundaries?
   - Since y is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, x could be positioned to touch only z's boundary, making EC(x,z) possible.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   - If x overlaps with some part of z that doesn't include y, this is possible. Since DC(x,y) means x and y share no parts, and NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, x could overlap with parts of z that don't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   - If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and if x is disconnected from y (which is also inside z), then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   - If x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and still disconnected from y (which is also inside z), then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   - This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is inside z, and x is disconnected from y. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x, which would contradict DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   - Similar to TPPi, this would mean z is completely inside x, which would imply y is also inside x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are coincident?
   - If x and z are the same, and y is inside z, then y would also be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check this.

For DC(x,z), we can imagine y as a ball inside another ball z, and x as a ball completely outside z. In this case, DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have DC(x,z).

For EC(x,z), imagine y as a ball inside another ball z, and x as a ball touching the outer ball z at the boundary but not overlapping with it. In this case, DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have EC(x,z).

For PO(x,z), imagine y as a ball inside another ball z, and x as a ball that overlaps with part of z but not with y. In this case, DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have PO(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), imagine y as a ball inside another ball z, and x as another ball inside z that touches z's boundary but is disconnected from y. In this case, DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have TPP(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z), imagine y as a ball inside another ball z, and x as another ball completely inside z but disconnected from y. In this case, DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check that TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are indeed impossible.

For TPPi(x,z), we would have z inside x, touching x's boundary. But since y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), y would also be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z), we would have z completely inside x. But since y is inside z, y would also be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But since y is inside z, y would also be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, actually, let me think through this one more time. I'm not sure I got all the constraints right.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
   This is possible if x is completely outside z. Since y is inside z, x would also be disconnected from y, satisfying DC(x,y).

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
   This is possible if x is outside z but touches z's boundary. Since y is strictly inside z (doesn't touch the boundary), x would be disconnected from y, satisfying DC(x,y).

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if x overlaps with z but doesn't overlap with y (since DC(x,y)). We can have x overlapping with parts of z that don't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and doesn't overlap with y. Since z is larger than y (y is a proper part of z), there's room for x to be inside z without overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is completely inside z, doesn't touch z's boundary, and doesn't overlap with y. Again, since z is larger than y, there's room for x to be inside z without overlapping with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If z is a proper part of x, then y would also be a part of x (since y is a proper part of z). But this contradicts DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similarly, if z is a proper part of x, then y would also be a part of x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   If x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of z, then y would also be a proper part of x, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I think this is correct. Let me triple-check with concrete examples.

For DC(x,z), imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as another circle completely outside z. Then DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have DC(x,z).

For EC(x,z), imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as another circle touching z's boundary from the outside. Then DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have EC(x,z).

For PO(x,z), imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as another circle that overlaps with part of z but not with y. Then DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have PO(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as another circle inside z, touching z's boundary but not overlapping with y. Then DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have TPP(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z), imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as another circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) but not overlapping with y. Then DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied, and we have NTPP(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z, given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If x is completely outside z while y is inside z, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. If x touches z's boundary from the outside while y is fully inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x and y remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with z in areas that don't contain y.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be inside z, touching z's boundary, while still being disconnected from y (which is also inside z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, yet still disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were part of x, then y would also be part of x (since y is part of z), contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
