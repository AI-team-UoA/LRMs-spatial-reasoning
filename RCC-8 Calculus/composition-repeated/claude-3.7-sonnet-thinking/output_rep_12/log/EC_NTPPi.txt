PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me reason about this problem. I need to determine the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

So, we have:
- x and y touch at their boundary (EC)
- z is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary (NTPP(z,y))

Let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is entirely inside y (not touching y's boundary), it means that x and z cannot share any points. 

If z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary without sharing any interior, then x and z must be completely separate regions that don't touch or overlap.

The only possible relationship between x and z would be DC(x,z), meaning x and z are disconnected.

To verify this: 
- x touches only y's boundary (EC(x,y))
- z is entirely inside y, away from the boundary (NTPP(z,y))
- Therefore, x and z cannot touch or overlap, making them disconnected (DC(x,z))

I believe the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double check this by thinking about concrete examples.

Imagine y as a circle, x as another circle that touches y at a single point (making EC(x,y) true), and z as a smaller circle completely inside y and not touching y's boundary (making NTPP(z,y) or equivalently NTPPi(y,z) true). In this scenario, x and z would indeed be disconnected (DC(x,z)).

I can't think of any other possible configuration where EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) would result in any other relationship between x and z besides DC(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully to be sure.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundary but don't share interior points
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary

The key insight is that z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary. Since x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside y, x cannot possibly interact with z.

Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.

Let me verify this by checking if any other RCC-8 relation could hold:

- EC(x,z)? No, because z doesn't reach y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary.
- PO(x,z)? No, because x doesn't share interior points with y, so it can't share interior points with z which is inside y.
- TPP(x,z)? No, because x isn't inside z.
- NTPP(x,z)? No, because x isn't inside z.
- TPPi(x,z)? No, because z isn't inside x.
- NTPPi(x,z)? No, because z isn't inside x.
- EQ(x,z)? No, because x and z have different relationships with y.

So, DC(x,z) is indeed the only possible relationship.

Thus, the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me think more deeply about this. I need to be careful about the definitions and implications.

Let's examine the constraints again:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means z properly contains y, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Actually, I think I was mistaken in my interpretation of NTPPi(y,z). This doesn't mean that z is inside y. Rather, it means that y is inside z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

So the picture is:
- x touches y at the boundary
- y is properly inside z (without touching z's boundary)

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

If x touches y at the boundary, and y is well inside z, then x could:
1. Be completely outside z (DC)
2. Touch z at the boundary (EC)
3. Partially overlap with z (PO)
4. Be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)
5. Be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)

Let me think about each of these possibilities.

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at the boundary, but y is so far inside z that x doesn't reach z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at the boundary, and that point where they touch is also on the boundary of z.

Wait, I don't think this is possible. If y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPPi(y,z)), then x touching y means x is touching a point not on z's boundary. For x to also touch z's boundary, it would need to extend further and touch z somewhere else.

Actually, EC(x,z) might be possible if x touches y at a point, and then extends to also touch z's boundary elsewhere.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x partially overlaps with z. Given that y is well inside z, and x touches y, x could extend into z (overlapping with it) and also extend outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary, and touching y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But I'm not entirely confident, let me recheck by creating a concrete example for each possible relation.

Actually, let me be more methodical. Let's draw out the situation:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z (without touching z's boundary).

Let's think about where x can be in relation to z:

1. DC(x,z): If y is inside z and x touches y, can x be completely outside z? If x only touches y at a point, then no part of x is inside z. But this seems to contradict NTPPi(y,z), which says y is well inside z. If y is well inside z and x touches y, then x must extend into z, at least at the point where it touches y.

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself. Let's go back to basics.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y; z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

So, we have:
- x and y touch at their boundary.
- z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (away from the boundary), x and z cannot share any points or touch. They must be disconnected.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, actually I'm making a conceptual error. Let me remind myself of the exact definitions of these relations:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. The inverse means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So the scenario is:
- x and y touch at the boundary (EC).
- y is inside z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z (NTPPi).

Now, I need to consider where x can be in relation to z.

If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x could potentially:
- Be completely outside z (DC)
- Touch z at the boundary (EC)
- Partially overlap with z (PO)
- Be inside z, touching z's boundary (TPP)
- Be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary (NTPP)

Let me think about each of these possibilities and see which ones are consistent with the given constraints.

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of NTPPi:
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is entirely within y, not touching y's boundary.

But wait, that's the inverse. So NTPPi(y,z) actually means NTPP(y,z), which means y is entirely within z, not touching z's boundary.

I think I had it right the second time around. Let me clarify:

NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. It's the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, the given constraints are:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, given that x touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's visualize this: y is well inside z, and x touches y at the boundary. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, x is reaching inside z to touch y. This means at the very least, x and z share some points (x is reaching inside z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Since x is reaching inside z to touch y, and y is not touching z's boundary, x must either:
1. Extend inside z (to touch y) and also extend outside z, making it PO(x,z).
2. Be completely inside z, touching z's boundary, making it TPP(x,z).
3. Be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, making it NTPP(x,z).

Option 1 (PO) is possible if x partially overlaps with z, extending both inside and outside of z.
Option 2 (TPP) is possible if x is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary.
Option 3 (NTPP) is possible if x is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

EC(x,z) is not possible because if x touches y (which is well inside z), x must penetrate z, making it more than just touching z's boundary.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me re-review and be more careful. 

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. That's equivalent to saying NTPP(y,z).

If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), then where could x be in relation to z?

1. DC(x,z): x could be completely outside z. This is possible if x only touches y at a point, and y is inside z.

Hmm, I'm not convinced. If y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, then x must extend into z, at least at the point where it touches y. So, x and z must share at least one point, which rules out DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): x could touch z at the boundary. But if y is inside z, away from z's boundary, and x touches y, then x must penetrate into z. This means x and z share more than just a boundary point, ruling out EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z. This is possible. If x touches y (which is inside z) and also extends outside z, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y (which is inside z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z, doesn't touch z's boundary, but touches y (which is inside z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But given that y is inside z, and y is of non-zero size, z must be of non-zero size. If z is inside x, then x must be larger than z. But if x only touches y at a boundary, it's hard to see how z (which contains y) could be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) seems implausible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For the same reasons as above, this seems implausible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is ruled out.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I am still not confident. Let me revisit this using a concrete example:

Imagine z as a big circle. Inside z, away from its boundary, is another circle y. Now, imagine a third circle x that touches y from the outside.

In this setup, EC(x,y) holds because x touches y at the boundary. NTPPi(y,z) also holds because y is inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now, where could x be in relation to z?

1. x could be completely outside z. This would make DC(x,z) true. But if y is inside z, away from z's boundary, and x touches y, then x must extend into z. So, DC(x,z) seems implausible.

But actually, I'm not being careful about the interpretation. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundary. It doesn't necessarily mean that x is reaching inside y. It means x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior points.

So, let's re-visualize: z is a big circle. Inside z, away from its boundary, is another circle y. Circle x touches circle y at a single point on y's boundary. Now, x could be:
- Entirely outside z, touching y at a single point. This would be DC(x,z).
- Touching both y and z at their boundaries. This would be EC(x,z).
- Partially inside z, touching y. This would be PO(x,z).
- Entirely inside z, touching z's boundary and also touching y. This would be TPP(x,z).
- Entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching y. This would be NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I was overly restrictive in my interpretation. Let's think step by step:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundary but don't share interior points.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. That's equivalent to saying NTPP(y,z).

Now, if y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, then where could x be in relation to z?

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points. But if x touches y (which is inside z), then x must extend into z at least at that point. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I'm not being careful again. If y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, x might not extend into z at all. If the distance from y to the boundary of z is greater than the radius of y, then x could touch y without touching or overlapping with z. So, DC(x,z) could be possible.

Actually, no, I think that's wrong. Let me be very precise.

If NTPPi(y,z), which is NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. 

If y is inside z and x touches y, then x must penetrate into z at least at the point where it touches y. This means x and z share at least one point, ruling out DC(x,z).

However, if x only touches y at a single point on y's boundary, and that point is inside z (since y is inside z), then x might still be mostly outside z. This would make EC(x,z) possible, where x and z touch at that single point but don't share interior points.

It's also possible that x extends further into z, partially overlapping with it, making PO(x,z) true.

Or, x could be completely inside z, either touching z's boundary (TPP(x,z)) or not touching z's boundary (NTPP(x,z)).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's reason about this a bit more. I think I'm still not being precise enough.

Given that NTPPi(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and EC(x,y) means x touches y at the boundary, we need to consider the possible positions of x relative to z.

If y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), then the boundary of y is entirely inside z. If x touches y at the boundary, then at least part of x is inside z. The question is: where is the rest of x?

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we already established that at least part of x is inside z (where it touches y). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x touches z at the boundary. But if y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y, then x penetrates inside z. This contradicts the definition of EC, which requires that x and z don't share interior points. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x partially overlaps with z. This is possible if x touches y (which is inside z) and also extends outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y (which is inside z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z, doesn't touch z's boundary, but touches y (which is inside z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x, touching x's boundary. But given that y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, it's hard to see how z (which contains y) could be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not plausible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x, not touching x's boundary. For the same reasons as above, this is not plausible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is ruled out.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me re-review this once more to be certain. 

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. (equivalently, NTPP(y,z))

If y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y at the boundary, then x touches a point that is inside z. This means at least part of x is inside z.

Now, let's go through each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z share no points. But as we've established, at least part of x is inside z (where it touches y). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. But if y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y at the boundary, then x penetrates inside z. This contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This is possible. For instance, imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle that touches y at a single point and extends both inside and outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, touching z's boundary. This is possible. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and also touching y at a single point.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching y at a single point.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, touching x's boundary. Given that y is inside z, and x touches y at the boundary, it's hard to see how z (which contains y) could be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not plausible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, not touching x's boundary. For the same reasons as above, this is not plausible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. But if y is inside z, and x touches y at the boundary, then x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is ruled out.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself again.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
NTPPi(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)).

Now, if x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then x must penetrate inside z at least at the point where it touches y. This means x and z share at least one point.

DC(x,z) means x and z share no points. Since we've established that x and z share at least one point (where x touches y), DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. But the point where x touches y is in the interior of z (since y is inside z, not touching z's boundary). This means x and z share an interior point, which contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are all possible, as I've described above.

TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x, touching x's boundary. If y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, then z (which contains y) cannot be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is inside x, not touching x's boundary. For the same reasons as above, this is not possible.

EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region. But if y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But, wait, I think I made a conceptual error. I need to be careful in how I interpret "x touches y at the boundary".

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. This means the interiors of x and y don't overlap; they only touch at the boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This means the boundary of y is in the interior of z.

If x touches y at the boundary, and that boundary is in the interior of z, then x penetrates into the interior of z at that point. This means x and z share an interior point, ruling out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to be even more careful with my interpretation.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This means the interiors of x and y don't overlap; they only touch at the boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This means both the interior and boundary of y are in the interior of z.

If the boundary of y is in the interior of z, and x touches y at the boundary, then x touches a point in the interior of z. This means x penetrates into the interior of z at that point, which rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Now, we need to determine if x can be a tangential proper part of z (TPP), a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP), or partially overlap with z (PO).

TPP(x,z) means x is inside z, touching z's boundary. This is possible. For instance, imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and also touching y at a single point on y's boundary.

NTPP(x,z) means x is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching y at a single point on y's boundary.

PO(x,z) means x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This is possible. For instance, imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle that touches y at a single point on y's boundary and extends both inside and outside z.

TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not plausible for the reasons I've explained earlier.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's look again at EC(x,z). The definition of EC(x,z) is that the boundaries of x and z touch, but the interiors do not share any points.

Now, let's again examine what we know:
1. y is inside z, away from z's boundary (NTPPi(y,z)).
2. x touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)).

If y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, then x touches a point in the interior of z. This means the interiors of x and z share at least one point, which contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

By the same logic, DC(x,z) is also not possible because it requires x and z to share no points at all.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But, I want to be super sure, so let's double-check by considering a different scenario. 

Actually, I think it's better to draw a concrete example and trace through the constraints:

We have NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(y,z), i.e., y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For example, a small circle y inside a larger circle z, where y is away from z's boundary.

We also have EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. For example, a circle x that touches the small circle y at a single point on the boundary of y.

Now, for the relation between x and z:

DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points. But since x touches y, which is inside z, x and z must share at least one point. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. But the point where x touches y is in the interior of z, not on the boundary of z (because y is away from z's boundary). So, x and z share an interior point, which contradicts the definition of EC. Hence, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This is possible if x extends both inside and outside z. For instance, imagine a circle x that touches the small circle y at a single point and extends outside the large circle z.

TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at a point.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z, doesn't touch z's boundary, but touches y at a point.

TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x, touching x's boundary. Given that y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, z (which contains y) can't be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x, not touching x's boundary. For the same reasons as above, this is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I think I've gone back and forth on this problem a bit, but after careful consideration and drawing out the constraints, I'm confident that the answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to make sure I'm using the correct interpretations of the relations, so let me check:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Wait, I think I misunderstood NTPPi(y,z). NTPPi(y,z) doesn't mean y is inside z; it means the inverse, which is z is inside y.

Let's re-examine the constraints:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary.
2. NTPPi(y,z): z is inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Given the new understanding of NTPPi(y,z), here's the scenario: z is entirely inside y, away from y's boundary. x touches y at the boundary.

Now, because z is inside y and away from y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot share any points. This means the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, I'm not confident in this interpretation either, so let me double-check the definition of NTPPi.

NTPPi(a,b) is the inverse of NTPP(a,b). Now, NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b, which means a is inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary. The inverse, NTPPi(a,b), would mean b is a non-tangential proper part of a.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y, away from y's boundary.

With this understanding, the scenario is:
1. x and y touch at a boundary (EC(x,y)).
2. z is inside y, away from y's boundary (NTPPi(y,z)).

Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is inside y away from the boundary, x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

However, I'm not sure my interpretation is correct, so let me revisit the definitions again.

Actually, I found my confusion: the 'i' in 'TPPi' and 'NTPPi' refers to the 'inverse' of the relation. So, TPPi(a,b) means the same as TPP(b,a).

Given that, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y, away from y's boundary.

So, the scenario is:
1. x and y touch at a boundary (EC(x,y)).
2. z is inside y, away from y's boundary (NTPP(z,y) or equivalently, NTPPi(y,z)).

Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is inside y away from the boundary, x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

Alright, I think I've been making a conceptual error. Let me be precise:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. This means a is inside b, touching b's boundary.
NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b. This means a is inside b, not touching b's boundary.
TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. It's the inverse of TPP(a,b).
NTPPi(a,b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a. It's the inverse of NTPP(a,b).

So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y, away from y's boundary (NTPP(z,y)).

Given that:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
2. NTPP(z,y): z is inside y, away from y's boundary.

Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is inside y away from the boundary, x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

To check this, I can use a simple example:
y is a circle, z is a smaller circle inside y (away from y's boundary), and x is a circle that touches y at a single point on the boundary. In this scenario, x and z don't share any points, making DC(x,z) the only possible relationship.

The answer is DC(x,z).

Hmm, wait, the definition of NTPPi:

"NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y)."

Given the instructions, this means that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. In other words, z is properly inside y.

So, the scenario is:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary.
2. z is inside y, away from y's boundary (NTPP(z,y) or equivalently, NTPPi(y,z)).

I remain confident that the answer is DC(x,z). To check this, I can use a simple example:
y is a circle, z is a smaller circle inside y (away from y's boundary), and x is a circle that touches y at a single point on the boundary. In this scenario, x and z don't share any points, making DC(x,z) the only possible relationship.

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

Let me use the definitions from the instructions to be sure:

"DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts."
"EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts."
"PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other."
"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary."
"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary."
"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."
"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."
"EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident."

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. In simpler terms, z is inside y, away from y's boundary.

Given that:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. z is inside y, away from y's boundary (NTPP(z,y) or equivalently, NTPPi(y,z)).

Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is inside y away from the boundary, x and z don't share any points. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the same as NTPP(z,y), meaning z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary

So the scenario is:
- x touches y at the boundary only
- z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Since z is properly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot share any points or touch each other. They must be completely disconnected.
