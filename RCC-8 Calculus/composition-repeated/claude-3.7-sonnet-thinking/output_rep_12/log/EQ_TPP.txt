PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

Now, what does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially identical. This means that x has the exact same spatial properties as y.

Since TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Given that x and y are spatially identical (EQ(x,y)), and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. 

EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy exactly the same space.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary.

Since x and y occupy the same space, and y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary, then x must also be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary.

So indeed, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what happens when we have EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's understand what each relation means in this context:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially identical. This means x has exactly the same spatial properties and relations as y.

Given that y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x is coincident with y (EQ(x,y)), it follows that x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
