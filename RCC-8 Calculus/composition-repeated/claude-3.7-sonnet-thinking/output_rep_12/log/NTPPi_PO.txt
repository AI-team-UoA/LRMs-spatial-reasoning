PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step, using the definitions of the RCC-8 relations.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z. This means y and z share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained within the other.

Now we need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let's consider each of the 8 RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Is it possible that x and z share no parts?
   No, this is not possible. Since y is completely inside x and y shares some part with z, then x must share at least that part with z. So x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Is it possible that x and z touch only at their boundaries?
   No, this is not possible either. Since y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y overlaps with z, there must be some interior overlap between x and z. They cannot just touch at boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Is it possible that x and z share some parts but neither is contained in the other?
   Yes, this is possible. If z extends beyond x in some areas, but also shares parts with y (which is inside x), then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary?
   This seems possible. If z completely contains x and x touches the boundary of z, while y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, this configuration works.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary?
   Yes, this is possible. If z completely contains x and there's a gap between x's boundary and z's boundary, this works with the given constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: Is it possible that z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary?
   Yes, this is possible. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, while y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, this configuration works.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: Is it possible that z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary?
   Yes, this is possible. If z is completely inside x with a gap between their boundaries, and y (which is inside x) partially overlaps with z, this configuration works.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: Is it possible that x and z are the same region?
   Yes, this is possible. If x and z are the same region, and y is inside both of them and partially overlaps with them, this configuration works.

Wait, I need to be more careful with my reasoning. Let me reconsider each case more carefully:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Since y is contained in x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share at least the overlap between y and z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Since y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y overlaps with z, there must be some interior region shared between x and z. EC requires that they only touch at their boundaries, which contradicts this. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is possible. Since y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, x and z must share some interior region. If z extends beyond x in some areas, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This means x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is compatible with y being inside x and partially overlapping with z, as long as the partial overlap allows for this configuration. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is compatible with y being inside x and partially overlapping with z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: This means z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is compatible with y being inside x and partially overlapping with z, as long as the partial overlap allows for this configuration. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is compatible with y being inside x and partially overlapping with z, as long as the partial overlap allows for this configuration. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This means x and z are the same region. This is compatible with y being inside both x and z, and partially overlapping with them. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Let me double-check some of these answers, as I think I might have made some mistakes.

For TPP(x,z), I said it's possible, but let me think about it more carefully. We have NTPPi(x,y), which means y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. We also have PO(y,z), which means y and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. If x were a TPP of z, then x would be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), y would also be completely inside z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that y not be completely contained in z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

By a similar argument, NTPP(x,z) is not possible either.

Let me also reconsider EQ(x,z). If x and z were equal, then since y is completely inside x, y would also be completely inside z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), we know y is completely inside x. We also know y and z partially overlap. If z were completely inside x and touched x's boundary, this would be consistent with y and z partially overlapping. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), if z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, this would be consistent with y and z partially overlapping (as long as y and z have some overlap but neither is contained in the other). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let's draw it out more carefully with examples to make sure.

1. PO(x,z): 
   - Imagine x is a big circle, y is a small circle completely inside x, and z is a circle that partially overlaps with y but extends outside of x. In this case, x and z partially overlap, y is completely inside x, and y partially overlaps with z. This configuration satisfies NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), and results in PO(x,z).

2. TPP(x,z):
   - Imagine z is a big circle, x is a smaller circle that touches the boundary of z, and y is a even smaller circle completely inside x. For PO(y,z) to be true, y cannot be completely inside z, which contradicts y being completely inside x and x being completely inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

3. NTPP(x,z):
   - Similarly, if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is completely inside x, then y would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPPi(x,z):
   - Imagine x is a big circle, z is a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x, and y is an even smaller circle completely inside x but partially overlapping with z. This configuration satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in TPPi(x,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z):
   - Imagine x is a big circle, z is a smaller circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y is another circle completely inside x and partially overlapping with z. This configuration satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. EQ(x,z):
   - If x and z are the same region, and y is completely inside x, then y would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So to summarize, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check the case of TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) to make sure they're not possible.

For TPP(x,z), we have x is a proper part of z, touching z's boundary. We know y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means y is also completely inside z. But we're given that PO(y,z), which means y and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), we have x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. We know y is completely inside x. This means y is also completely inside z. But we're given that PO(y,z), which means y and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So I confirm that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the situation more carefully. 

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. 
- PO(y,z): y and z share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other.

Let's think about what these constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z.

First, since y is completely inside x and y shares some interior parts with z, x and z must share some interior parts. This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Now, since y is completely inside x and y is not completely inside z (from PO(y,z)), x cannot be completely inside z. This rules out TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

So the only possible relations are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let's verify that each of these is actually possible:

1. PO(x,z): Imagine x is a large region, y is a small region completely inside x, and z is a region that partially overlaps with y and extends outside of x. This satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), and results in PO(x,z).

2. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a large region, y is a small region completely inside x, and z is a region completely inside x that touches x's boundary and partially overlaps with y. This satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), and results in TPPi(x,z).

3. NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a large region, y is a small region completely inside x, and z is a region completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) that partially overlaps with y. This satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), and results in NTPPi(x,z).

All three of these relations are possible between x and z, given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm not sure I provided sufficient justification for why EQ(x,z) is impossible. Let me reconsider this case:

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. We know y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. If x and z are the same, then y would be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which means y and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me think step by step once more to make sure I've considered all cases correctly:

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other.

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: 
   If x and z are disconnected, they share no parts. But since y is inside x and overlaps with z, x and z must share at least the part where y and z overlap. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   If x and z are externally connected, they touch only at their boundaries and share no interior parts. But since y is inside x and overlaps with z, x and z must share at least the interior part where y and z overlap. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   If x and z partially overlap, they share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is consistent with y being inside x and partially overlapping with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x, y would also be completely inside z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that y not be completely contained in z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x, y would also be completely inside z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part:
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside x and partially overlapping with z. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part:
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside x and partially overlapping with z. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   If x and z are the same region, and y is completely inside x, then y would be completely inside z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK so to finalize, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
1. PO(x,z)
2. TPPi(x,z)
3. NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relations can hold between x and z given that NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me understand what these given relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither is completely contained in the other

Now I'll analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share at least that overlapping part.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. The overlap between y and z creates interior overlap between x and z, not just boundary contact.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can share parts where y and z overlap, while z extends beyond x in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were completely inside z, then y would be completely inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPP - it would force y to be completely inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary while partially overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary while partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, y would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
