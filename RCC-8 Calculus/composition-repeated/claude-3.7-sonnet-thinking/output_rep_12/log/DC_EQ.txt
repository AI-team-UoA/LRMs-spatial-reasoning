PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step.

We are given that:
1. DC(x,y) - x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EQ(y,z) - y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are essentially the same region in space. Therefore, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between x and y.

Given that DC(x,y), meaning x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts, and y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x and z are also disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

But let me double-check by considering the definitions of all relations:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent, and DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, it's clear that x and z must also be disconnected. The only relation that describes this is DC(x,z).

Actually, I should be more careful here. Let's ensure that DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship by going through each of the RCC-8 relations and checking if they're consistent with the given information:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, and z is identical to y, then x and y would also be disconnected. This is consistent with DC(x,y).

2. EC(x,z): If x and z touch at a boundary, and z is identical to y, then x and y would also touch at a boundary. This contradicts DC(x,y), which states that x and y are disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z share a spatial part, and z is identical to y, then x and y would also share a spatial part. This contradicts DC(x,y).

4. TPP(x,z): If x is part of z and touches z's boundary, and z is identical to y, then x would be part of y and touch y's boundary. This contradicts DC(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary, and z is identical to y, then x would be part of y but not touch y's boundary. This contradicts DC(x,y).

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is part of x and touches x's boundary, and z is identical to y, then y would be part of x and touch x's boundary. This contradicts DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary, and z is identical to y, then y would be part of x but not touch x's boundary. This contradicts DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are coincident, and z is identical to y, then x and y would also be coincident. This contradicts DC(x,y).

So, out of all the RCC-8 relations, only DC(x,z) is consistent with the given information. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

To summarize: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship must hold between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are essentially identical in terms of spatial extent, any relationship that x has with y must be the same relationship that x has with z.

We know that x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and since z occupies exactly the same space as y, x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
