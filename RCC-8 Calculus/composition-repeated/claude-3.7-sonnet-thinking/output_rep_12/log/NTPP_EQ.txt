PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical regions.

Given these two facts, we need to determine the possible relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are the same region. This means that any relationship that holds between x and y will also hold between x and z.

If NTPP(x,y), then x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), x must also be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Let's double-check this by considering the definitions:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (the same region).

Since y and z are the same region, and x is a proper part of y not touching y's boundary, x must also be a proper part of z not touching z's boundary. This is precisely the definition of NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z based on two given facts:

1. NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (identical regions)

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (doesn't touch y's boundary), and y is identical to z, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
