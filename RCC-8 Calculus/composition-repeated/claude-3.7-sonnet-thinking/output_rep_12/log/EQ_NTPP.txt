PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy the exact same space.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Now, since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), they have the exact same spatial properties. If y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Let me verify this by thinking about the definitions more precisely:

EQ(x,y) means that x and y occupy exactly the same space - they are spatially identical.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Since x and y are spatially identical, and y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, it follows that x is also entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

I believe this is the only possible relationship given the constraints.

Actually, let me double-check by considering the properties of RCC-8 relations more carefully:

If EQ(x,y), then x and y are identical in terms of their spatial extent.
If NTPP(y,z), then y is properly contained within z, not touching the boundary.

Given these two facts, x must have the same relationship to z as y does, which is NTPP.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationships EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (spatially identical)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (entirely inside z without touching z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy exactly the same space, x must have the exact same spatial relationship with z as y does. 

If y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
