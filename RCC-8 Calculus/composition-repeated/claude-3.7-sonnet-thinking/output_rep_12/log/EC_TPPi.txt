PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z. Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
   Is this possible? Since EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. And since TPP(z,y), z is inside y and touches y's boundary. It's possible that x and z don't touch at all if they touch different parts of y's boundary. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   Is this possible? Since EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. And since TPP(z,y), z is inside y and touches y's boundary. If x and z touch the same part of y's boundary, then EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Is this possible? Since EC(x,y), x and y only touch at the boundary and don't share interior parts. Since TPP(z,y), z is inside y. So z is inside y, and x is outside y, touching only at the boundary. It seems like x and z cannot overlap, so PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? Since EC(x,y), x is outside y, touching only at the boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is inside y. It doesn't seem possible for x to be inside z when x is outside y and z is inside y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? Similar to TPP, this doesn't seem possible. If x is outside y and z is inside y, x cannot be inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? Since EC(x,y), x is outside y, touching only at the boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is inside y. It seems possible that if z touches the boundary of y at the same point where x touches y, and z is much smaller than y, then z could be a tangential proper part of x. However, this would mean that x and y overlap, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I need to reconsider this. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary but do not share interior parts. This doesn't necessarily mean x is "outside" y; it just means they don't overlap. Similarly, if TPPi(y,z), this means TPP(z,y), so z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary. 

Let me re-analyze:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If EC(x,y) and TPP(z,y), it's possible that x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's different from where z touches y's boundary. In such a case, x and z would be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   If EC(x,y) and TPP(z,y), and if z touches y's boundary at the same point where x touches y, then x and z would touch at that point. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Given EC(x,y), x and y only touch at the boundary and don't share interior parts. Since TPP(z,y), z is inside y. If x and z overlapped, it would mean that x and y also overlap, which contradicts EC(x,y). So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Given EC(x,y), x is outside y (in the sense that they don't share interior parts). Since TPP(z,y), z is inside y. It's not possible for x to be inside z when x and y don't share interior parts but z is inside y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP, this is not possible for the same reason. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Since TPP(z,y), z is inside y. If z were also inside x, it would mean x and y overlap, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi, this is not possible for the same reason. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   If EC(x,y) and TPP(z,y), x and z cannot be coincident because x doesn't overlap with y but z does. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me rethink the TPPi(y,z) relation. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is inside z and touches z's boundary. This means z is the larger entity, and y is inside it.

Let's reconsider:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

Now, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Given that y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x would be touching z, not disconnected from it. However, if y touches z's boundary at a point that's different from where x touches y, then x and z could be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x would be touching z at that point. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   If y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, it's possible that x extends into z, resulting in a partial overlap between x and z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Given that y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, it's possible that x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, but the point of contact is not on z's boundary, then x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Given that y is inside z, and z is larger than y, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x, especially if x only touches y at the boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi, this is not possible for the same reason. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   Since y is inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning, since I'm getting different conclusions now.

Actually, I'm a bit confused about the exact implications of TPPi(y,z). Let me clarify:

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). So, z is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is inside y.
- z touches y's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y, so it's smaller than y.

Given this clarification, let's reconsider:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. TPP(z,y): z is inside y and touches y's boundary. 

Now, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's different from where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's the same as where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would touch at that point. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x and z to overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x to be inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP, this is not possible for the same reason. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Given that z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi, this is not possible for the same reason. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   Since z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Hmm, I think I'm still getting confused. Let me take a step back and visualize the scenario. I'll use a simpler approach.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): This means y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, if y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y, what are the possible configurations for x and z?

Visualizing:
- z is the largest region, with y inside it.
- y touches the boundary of z at some point(s).
- x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

Case 1: If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x would be outside z and touching z at that point. This corresponds to EC(x,z).

Case 2: If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, then x would be inside z. Since x and y touch at the boundary, x would be touching the boundary of z from the inside. This corresponds to TPP(x,z).

Case 3: If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, while still touching y at y's boundary, then this corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

Case 4: If part of x is inside z and part is outside, while still touching y at y's boundary, then this corresponds to PO(x,z).

Are there any other cases I'm missing? Let me check.

DC(x,z): Can x be disconnected from z? Given that x touches y and y is inside z, it seems like x must either touch z or be inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Given that y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): Can x and z be coincident? Since y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and PO(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check the case for DC(x,z). I said it's not possible, but let's think more carefully.

If y is inside z but touches z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, can x and z be disconnected? If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x would be touching z, which is EC(x,z). If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, then x would be inside z, which could be TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z). In all these cases, x and z are not disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and PO(x,z).

Actually, I think I might be overthinking this. Let me revisit the definitions:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given that y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x and z would be touching, not disconnected. If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, then x would be inside z, not disconnected from it. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x and z would be touching at that point. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, then x could be partially inside z and partially outside, which is a partial overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, and x is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary at some other point, then x would be a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, and x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Given that y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   Since y is inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me rethink.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's visualize:
- z is the largest region, with y inside it.
- y touches the boundary of z at some point(s).
- x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x would be outside z and touching z at that point. This corresponds to EC(x,z).

If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, then part of x would be inside z. Now, the rest of x could be inside z, or it could extend outside z. If it extends outside z, this corresponds to PO(x,z). If the rest of x is inside z and touches z's boundary, this corresponds to TPP(x,z). If the rest of x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, this corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

If it's a higher-dimensional topology (like regions in 2D space), there's another case: x and y could touch along a segment of y's boundary. If this segment is also on z's boundary, then x would be outside z and touching z along that segment. This still corresponds to EC(x,z). If this segment is not on z's boundary, then part of x would be inside z, leading to PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z) as described above.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I'm pretty confident in this answer, but let me double-check to make sure there's no other possibility.

DC(x,z): Can x be disconnected from z? Given that x touches y and y is inside z, touching z's boundary, it seems like x must either touch z or be partially inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Given that y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): Can x and z be coincident? Since y is inside z and x touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me re-double-check the case for DC(x,z). I said it's not possible, but I want to ensure I'm not missing anything.

If y is inside z but touches z's boundary, and x touches y at y's boundary, can x and z be disconnected? 

The key insight is that y touches z's boundary at some point, but not all of y's boundary is touching z's boundary. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, then x would be inside z (at least partially). If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x would be touching z at that point.

In both cases, x and z are not disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of "TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z".

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). So, z is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is inside y.
- z touches y's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y, so it's smaller than y.

So, I need to revise my visualization:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let's visualize:
- y is the largest region, with z inside it.
- z touches the boundary of y at some point(s).
- x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

Now, what are the possible configurations for x and z?

If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's different from where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would be disconnected. This corresponds to DC(x,z).

If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's the same as where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would be touching at that point. This corresponds to EC(x,z).

Are there any other possibilities? Let's check.

PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x and z to overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x to be inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is not possible. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Given that z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): Can x and z be coincident? Since z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Hmm, let me once more check what TPPi(y,z) means. 

According to the description provided, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So, my most recent analysis is correct.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check a few cases I dismissed:

PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x and z to overlap without x also overlapping with y. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x to be inside z without x also being inside y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is not possible. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Given that z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x without x also overlapping with y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): Can x and z be coincident? Since z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same without x also being inside y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Wait, I just realized something important. The description says:

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

This means x and y don't overlap, but they touch at their boundaries. It doesn't necessarily mean x is "outside" y; they could be adjacent regions.

Given that clarification, let's reconsider:

If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary), then what are the possible relations between x and z?

Let's visualize:
- y is a region, with z inside it.
- z touches the boundary of y at some point(s).
- x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's different from where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would be disconnected. This corresponds to DC(x,z).

If x and y touch at a point on y's boundary that's the same as where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would be touching at that point. This corresponds to EC(x,z).

Are there any other possibilities? Let's check.

PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x and z to overlap without x also overlapping with y. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x to be inside z without x also being inside y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is not possible. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Given that z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x without x also overlapping with y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): Can x and z be coincident? Since z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same without x also being inside y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I'm quite confident in this answer.

Actually, since EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary, and y has TPPi relation with z, let's visualize it as:

- z is the surrounding region with y inside it
- y touches the boundary of z
- x is a separate region that touches the boundary of y

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Case 1: If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not where y touches z's boundary, then x is outside z and not touching z. This corresponds to DC(x,z).

Case 2: If x touches y at the same point where y touches z's boundary, then x is outside z but touching z at that point. This corresponds to EC(x,z).

Let me double-check the other cases:

PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Since x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't overlap with y, and y is inside z, it's not possible for x to overlap with z without also overlapping with y. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Since x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't overlap with y, and y is inside z, it's not possible for x to be inside z without also being inside or overlapping with y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is not possible. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Since y is inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, it's not possible for z to be inside x without x also overlapping with y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): Can x and z be coincident? Since y is inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, I think there's a missing case. Let me think through this more carefully.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let's visualize z as the inner region, y as the middle region, and the question is about the relation between the inner region z and the outer region x.

If z touches y's boundary at a point that's different from where x touches y's boundary, then x and z are disconnected. This corresponds to DC(x,z).

If z touches y's boundary at the same point where x touches y's boundary, then x and z are touching at that point. This corresponds to EC(x,z).

The question was, given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Recall the definition of TPPi:
TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

So in TPPi(y,z), y is the larger region, and z is the smaller region inside y, touching y's boundary.

As a clarification: EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Let's check the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's different from where z touches y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. This is possible if x touches y at the same point where z touches y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't overlap with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x to overlap with z without also overlapping with y. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't overlap with y, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for x to be inside z without also being inside y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to TPP, this is not possible. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x without x also overlapping with y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to TPPi, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. Since z is inside y and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same without x also being inside y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Alright, let me double-check one more time.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

If x touches y at a boundary point and z also touches y at a boundary point, there are two possibilities:

1. If these two boundary points are different, then x and z are disconnected. This corresponds to DC(x,z).

2. If these two boundary points are the same, then x and z are touching at that point. This corresponds to EC(x,z).

Are there any other possibilities? 

Given that x and y only touch at the boundary and don't overlap, and z is inside y, it's not possible for x and z to overlap, for x to be inside z, or for z to be inside x. It's also not possible for x and z to be the same. So the only possible relations are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me just double-check what TPPi(y,z) means one more time.

TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary. 

So, my previous analysis is correct.

The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z, given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me break down what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary

Now, I'll analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Since x touches y only at the boundary (doesn't overlap with y), and z is inside y (touching y's boundary), there are two possible configurations:

   a) If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's different from where z touches y's boundary, then x and z don't touch at all → DC(x,z)

   b) If x touches y at the same point where z touches y's boundary, then x and z touch at that point → EC(x,z)

2. The other relations are impossible:
   - PO(x,z): Not possible because x and z can't overlap without x also overlapping with y
   - TPP/NTPP: Not possible because x can't be inside z without also being inside y
   - TPPi/NTPPi: Not possible because z can't be inside x while being inside y
   - EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y while x is outside
