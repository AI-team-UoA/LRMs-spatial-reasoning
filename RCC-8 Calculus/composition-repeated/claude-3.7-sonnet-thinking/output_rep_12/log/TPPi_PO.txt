PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this question step by step:

1. We know TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x) - so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

2. We know PO(y,z) - y and z partially overlap. This means that y and z share some common part, but neither is contained within the other.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about the spatial configuration:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- z overlaps with y but neither contains the other

Given these constraints, what are the possible configurations of z relative to x?

Case 1: z could be partially outside of x and partially inside x (overlapping with y inside x). This would be PO(x,z).

Case 2: z could be disconnected from x, with the overlap between y and z occurring at the boundary of x where y touches it. This would be DC(x,z).

Case 3: z could be touching x from the outside, with the overlap between y and z occurring at the boundary of x where y touches it. This would be EC(x,z).

Case 4: z could be containing x, with y overlapping with z both inside and outside of x. This would be TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I need to reconsider some of these cases more carefully.

For case 4, if z contains x, then z would also contain y (since y is inside x), which contradicts the PO(y,z) relationship. So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

Let me rethink. We have:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- z overlaps with y

Since y touches x's boundary, and z overlaps with y, there are several possibilities:
1. z could overlap with the part of y that's inside x but away from the boundary, making z completely inside x. This would be TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x), which are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

2. z could overlap with the part of y that touches x's boundary, and z could extend outside of x. This would be PO(x,z).

3. z could overlap with the part of y that touches x's boundary, but z might just touch x without extending inside. This would be EC(x,z).

4. z could be entirely outside of x, and overlap with y only at the boundary of x. This would be DC(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The condition PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points. Since y is completely inside x (TPPi(x,y)), any interior points of y are also interior points of x. So z must share some interior points with x as well. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

So we have:
1. PO(x,z) - z shares some interior with x but neither is contained in the other
2. TPPi(x,z) - z is contained in x and touches x's boundary
3. NTPPi(x,z) - z is completely contained in x without touching its boundary

Actually, I realize that I need to be more careful with my analysis. Let's reconsider:

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap

Since y is a proper part of x, and z overlaps with y, z must share some region with x (at least the part it shares with y). This immediately rules out DC(x,z).

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. EC(x,z): This would mean z only touches x at the boundary. But since PO(y,z) means y and z share interior points, and y is inside x, z must share some interior with x too. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

2. PO(x,z): z could overlap with x, sharing some interior points (at least those it shares with y), while also extending outside of x. This is possible.

3. TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z): z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible.

4. NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z): z could be completely inside x without touching its boundary. This is possible.

5. TPP(x,z) or TPPi(z,x): This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But this contradicts the fact that y is completely inside x while also partially overlapping with z. If x were inside z, then y would be inside z too, contradicting PO(y,z). So this is not possible.

6. NTPP(x,z) or NTPPi(z,x): Similarly, this would mean x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. This again leads to a contradiction with PO(y,z). So this is not possible.

7. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. But then z would completely contain y, contradicting PO(y,z). So this is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me verify this once more:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since z partially overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z could potentially extend outside of x. So TPPi(x,z) might not always be possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x without touching its boundary. Again, since z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x's boundary, z might also touch x's boundary or extend outside. So NTPPi(x,z) might not always be possible.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider regions:

Region 1: Interior of x
Region 2: Boundary of x
Region 3: Outside of x

We know y occupies some of Region 1 and some of Region 2 (since it's a tangential proper part of x).

Now, for PO(y,z) to be true, z and y must share some common part, but neither is contained within the other. This means z must occupy some part of the regions occupied by y (Regions 1 and 2) and also some other regions.

This gives several possibilities:
1. z occupies parts of Regions 1, 2, and 3. This gives PO(x,z).
2. z occupies parts of Regions 1 and 2, but not 3. Since neither y nor z contains the other, z must occupy some part of Region 1 that y doesn't, and y must occupy some part of Region 1 or 2 that z doesn't. This gives TPPi(x,z).
3. z occupies only part of Region 1 and not Regions 2 or 3. Since y touches the boundary of x, and z overlaps with y, z must also overlap with the part of y that touches the boundary, which would put z in Region 2. But we said z doesn't occupy Region 2, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible.

So it seems the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

But let me reconsider whether NTPPi(x,z) is possible:

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x without touching its boundary. Since y touches the boundary of x, and z overlaps with y, it would seem z should also touch the boundary of x. But the overlap between y and z could be in the interior of y, away from where y touches the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is still a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let's double-check with some specific scenarios:

Scenario 1: 
- y is a small region inside x, touching x's boundary.
- z overlaps with y in the interior of x, and also extends outside of x.
Relationship: PO(x,z)

Scenario 2:
- y is a small region inside x, touching x's boundary.
- z overlaps with y in the interior of x, but is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary.
Relationship: TPPi(x,z)

Scenario 3:
- y is a small region inside x, touching x's boundary.
- z overlaps with y only in the interior of x, away from where y touches the boundary of x, and z is completely contained within the interior of x.
Relationship: NTPPi(x,z)

Scenario 4:
- y is a small region inside x, touching x's boundary.
- z only touches y at the exact point where y touches the boundary of x, and z is completely outside of x.
Relationship: EC(x,z)

Wait, scenario 4 contradicts my earlier analysis where I said EC(x,z) isn't possible. Let me reconsider.

If z only touches y at the exact point where y touches the boundary of x, and z is completely outside of x, then z and y only share a boundary point, not any interior. But PO(y,z) requires y and z to share some interior points. So scenario 4 is not valid.

So I think my earlier conclusion is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me make one final check to see if I've missed anything or made an error:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because y is part of x and overlaps with z, so x and z must share at least the part of y that overlaps with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because PO(y,z) means y and z share interior points, and those interior points of y are also interior points of x.

3. PO(x,z): Possible as z can overlap with the interior of x and also extend outside.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible because if x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible as z can be inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible as z can be inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x and z are equal, then y is inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me carefully reconsider whether EC(x,z) is possible:

TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would only touch at their boundaries, sharing no interior. But we know that z shares interior points with y, and y's interior is inside x's interior. So z must share some interior with x as well, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So I am confident that EC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me reconsider the TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) cases:

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. For this to be consistent with PO(y,z), z would need to overlap with some but not all of y. However, it also means that z is completely contained in x. If z is completely contained in x, and y is also completely contained in x, and neither y nor z contains the other, then it's possible for them to partially overlap.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Similarly, for this to be consistent with PO(y,z), z would need to overlap with some but not all of y, and without touching x's boundary.

So upon reconsideration, both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are consistent with the given conditions.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, let me reconsider DC(x,z). 

If DC(x,z), then x and z share no points. But PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points. Since y is contained in x (due to TPPi(x,y)), those shared interior points of y and z are also in x. This contradicts DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

What about EC(x,z)? If EC(x,z), then x and z touch only at their boundaries. But again, PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points. Since y is contained in x, those shared interior points are also in x. So x and z must share some interior points, contradicting EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

What about TPP(x,z)? If TPP(x,z), then x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This means y is also completely contained in z (since y is inside x). But PO(y,z) means neither y nor z contains the other. This contradicts TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

What about EQ(x,z)? If EQ(x,z), then x and z are identical. This means y is completely contained in z. But PO(y,z) means neither y nor z contains the other. This contradicts EQ(x,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check by drawing a simple diagram. Let's say x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary. Now, for different possibilities of z:

1. z is another circle that overlaps with y and also extends outside of x. This gives PO(x,z).
2. z is another circle inside x that overlaps with y and also touches x's boundary. This gives TPPi(x,z).
3. z is another circle completely inside x that overlaps with y but doesn't touch x's boundary. This gives NTPPi(x,z).

All of these scenarios are consistent with the given conditions: TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, hold on. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Let's reconsider if these are consistent with PO(y,z):

PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. So for either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x. But then, z cannot contain y (since PO(y,z) means neither contains the other), and y is already inside x. So both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are consistent with the given conditions.

But one more time I'm going to triple-check:

To clarify:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Let's consider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But since y is inside x and overlaps with z, x and z must share the region where y and z overlap. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since y is inside x and overlaps with z, x and z must share some interior points (specifically, the interior points of y that overlap with z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. This is consistent with the given conditions.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z, which means y is also inside z (since y is inside x). But PO(y,z) means neither y nor z contains the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Like TPP(x,z), this would mean y is inside z, contradicting PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with PO(y,z) as long as z overlaps with some but not all of y, and y overlaps with some but not all of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also consistent with PO(y,z) under the same conditions as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. If x and z are the same, then y is inside z, contradicting PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But let me once again carefully consider whether TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are consistent with the given conditions:

We know y is inside x and touches x's boundary (TPPi(x,y)), and y and z share some interior points but neither contains the other (PO(y,z)).

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be inside x and touch x's boundary. Is this consistent with PO(y,z)? Yes, z can overlap with some but not all of y's interior, and y can overlap with some but not all of z's interior, even if z is confined to x.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, is this consistent with PO(y,z)? Yes, for the same reason as TPPi(x,z). Z can be entirely within the interior of x, overlapping with some but not all of y, and y can overlap with some but not all of z.

So both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are consistent with the given conditions.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually let me draw a specific region for TPPi(x,z). 

Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at the north, and z is another circle inside x that touches x's boundary at the east. If y and z overlap in their interior, but neither contains the other, then we have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, but neither contains the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

This scenario satisfies all our conditions.

What about a scenario for NTPPi(x,z)? Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at the north, and z is another smaller circle completely inside x, away from x's boundary, that overlaps with y in their interior. Then we have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, but neither contains the other.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

This scenario also satisfies all our conditions.

What about a scenario for PO(x,z)? Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at the north, and z is another circle that overlaps with y and also extends outside of x. Then we have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, but neither contains the other.
- PO(x,z): x and z overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither contains the other.

This scenario also satisfies all our conditions.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I believe this is the final answer. These three relationships are all consistent with the given conditions, and no others are.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, x contains y completely and y touches x's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap - they share some interior points but neither contains the other.

Given these conditions, let me analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Since y is inside x and y shares interior points with z, x and z must share some interior points as well. This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

2. If x were contained in z (TPP or NTPP), then y would also be contained in z (since y is in x), which contradicts PO(y,z). So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible.

3. If x and z were equal (EQ), then y would be contained in z, again contradicting PO(y,z).

4. PO(x,z) is possible - z can overlap with y inside x and also extend outside x.

5. TPPi(x,z) is possible - z can be completely inside x, touch x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.

6. NTPPi(x,z) is possible - z can be completely inside x without touching the boundary, and partially overlap with y.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
