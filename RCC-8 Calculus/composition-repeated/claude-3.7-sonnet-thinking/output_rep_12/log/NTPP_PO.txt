PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z, given that NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z). Let's think about what each of these means:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So x is entirely contained within y, and x does not touch y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is contained within the other.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z.

First, note that since x is entirely contained within y, and y and z partially overlap, x could be in the part of y that overlaps with z, or it could be in the part of y that does not overlap with z, or it could be partly in both.

Let's consider each possibility:

1. If x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, then x is a proper part of z. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y and z overlap but neither contains the other, it's not clear whether x would touch z's boundary. So the possible relations are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

2. If x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z, then x and z are disconnected. So the relation is DC(x,z).

3. If x is partly within the part of y that overlaps with z and partly within the part of y that does not overlap with z, then x and z partially overlap. So the relation is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me think again. I'm not sure my analysis of case 1 is correct.

Since NTPP(x,y), x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. And since PO(y,z), y and z overlap but neither contains the other.

Let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x could be entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z. In this case, x is a proper part of z. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and the part of y that overlaps with z is within z, x doesn't touch z's boundary. So the relation is NTPP(x,z).

2. x could be entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z. In this case, x and z are disconnected. So the relation is DC(x,z).

3. x could be partly within the part of y that overlaps with z and partly within the part of y that does not overlap with z. In this case, x and z partially overlap. So the relation is PO(x,z).

Actually, I'm still not sure about case 1. Let's think about it differently. If x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, x is within both y and z. But we need to determine whether x touches z's boundary.

Since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary. And since PO(y,z), the part of y that overlaps with z has some parts on z's boundary. So if x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, x could be touching z's boundary or not.

Hmm, this is still not clear. Let me try to visualize it.

Imagine y as a circle, and x as a smaller circle entirely within y and not touching y's boundary. Now, imagine z as another circle that partially overlaps with y. The part of y that overlaps with z is a lens-shaped region.

If x is entirely within this lens-shaped region, then x is entirely within z. But whether x touches z's boundary depends on the specific positions of x, y, and z.

Actually, I think I misunderstood something. If x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, then x is entirely within both y and z. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (due to NTPP(x,y)), and the part of y that overlaps with z is within z, x can't touch z's boundary at points where z's boundary is outside of y.

But, and this is the key point I missed, x could touch z's boundary at points where z's boundary is inside y. So, if x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, the relation between x and z could be NTPP(x,z) or TPP(x,z).

Hmm, I'm still not sure that analysis is correct. Let's go back to the definitions:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means that y and z overlap, but neither is contained within the other.

Given these, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. x could be entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z. In this case, x is entirely within z. 

   Now, does x touch z's boundary? Since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary. The boundary of the part of y that overlaps with z consists of two parts: some parts of y's boundary and some parts of z's boundary that are inside y.

   Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it doesn't touch the parts of the boundary of the overlap that are on y's boundary. But it could potentially touch the parts of the boundary of the overlap that are on z's boundary inside y.

   So, if x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, the relation between x and z could be NTPP(x,z) or TPP(x,z).

I'm getting confused again.
Let's be even more explicit about this. 

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap.

Let's call the region of overlap between y and z as O. So, O is a part of both y and z.

Now, the possible positions of x relative to O:

1. x is completely inside O: In this case, x is completely inside z (since O is a part of z). But does x touch z's boundary? That's the key question to determine whether the relation is TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

   The boundary of O within y is a combination of parts of z's boundary that are inside y. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (due to NTPP(x,y)), the only way x could touch z's boundary is if it touches the parts of z's boundary that are inside y.

   This is possible. For example, imagine y as a large circle, z as another large circle that partially overlaps with y, and x as a small circle inside y. If x is positioned such that it touches the part of z's boundary that's inside y, then the relation would be TPP(x,z).

   On the other hand, if x is positioned such that it doesn't touch any part of z's boundary, then the relation would be NTPP(x,z).

2. x is completely outside O: In this case, x is inside y but outside z. Since x and z don't share any points, the relation is DC(x,z).

3. x is partly inside O and partly outside O (but still completely inside y): In this case, x shares some points with z but neither is completely inside the other. So, the relation is PO(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, I think there's another possibility I've missed. Let me reconsider.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap.

Given these, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z:
   - If x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).
   - If x touches z's boundary (which is possible if z's boundary passes through the interior of y), then TPP(x,z).

2. x is entirely within y but outside z:
   - In this case, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).

3. x is partly within the overlapping region of y and z and partly within y but outside z:
   - In this case, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

4. x equals the overlapping region of y and z:
   - This would mean that x is exactly the intersection of y and z. But if NTPP(x,y), then x doesn't touch y's boundary, which means x is strictly inside y. The overlapping region of y and z, on the other hand, touches y's boundary at some points (specifically, at the points where z's boundary intersects y's boundary). So, this case is not possible.

Alright, let's see if there's any other possibility I've missed.

Actually, I think my point 4 might be flawed. Let's be more careful. The overlapping region of y and z doesn't necessarily touch y's boundary. It depends on the specific positions of y and z.

Let's think again about the definition of PO(y,z): it means that y and z overlap, but neither is contained within the other. This implies that some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

But the overlapping region, which is the intersection of y and z, doesn't necessarily touch y's boundary. It could be strictly inside y, in which case it could potentially be equal to x.

Let's consider that possibility.

Actually, let's think about it a different way. We have NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z). Let's break down PO(y,z):

PO(y,z) means:
1. Some part of y is inside z.
2. Some part of y is outside z.
3. Some part of z is inside y.
4. Some part of z is outside y.

Now, given NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y. The possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x is entirely inside the part of y that's inside z:
   - If x doesn't touch the boundary of this part, then NTPP(x,z).
   - If x touches the boundary of this part, then TPP(x,z). But note that the boundary of this part can include parts of z's boundary that are inside y. So, x can touch z's boundary.

2. x is entirely inside the part of y that's outside z:
   - In this case, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).

3. x is partly inside the part of y that's inside z and partly inside the part of y that's outside z:
   - In this case, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

4. x is exactly the part of y that's inside z:
   - If PO(y,z), then this part of y touches y's boundary at some points. But NTPP(x,y), so x doesn't touch y's boundary. Hence, this case is not possible.

OK but let's be careful here. If x is the region of y inside z, that doesn't necessarily mean that x touches y's boundary. Consider a scenario where y is a large circle, z is another large circle that partially overlaps with y, and the overlapping region doesn't touch y's boundary. In such a case, x could be exactly this overlapping region and still satisfy NTPP(x,y).

Actually, I think I've been overthinking point 4. It's simpler than that. If x is exactly the part of y that's inside z, then x and z have a specific relationship. What is it?

If x is exactly the part of y that's inside z, then x is exactly the intersection of y and z. This means x is a proper part of z. And, given the assumption, x is a proper part of y.

The question is: does x touch z's boundary? Well, x is the intersection of y and z, so the boundary of x consists of parts of y's boundary and parts of z's boundary. If x touches z's boundary, it would be at the points where y's boundary intersects z.

But here's the issue: NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch y's boundary. So, if x is the intersection of y and z, and x doesn't touch y's boundary, then the boundary of x consists solely of parts of z's boundary inside y. This means x touches z's boundary, so the relation would be TPP(x,z).

However, I'm not convinced this is a valid case. Let's think about it another way. NTPP(x,y) means x is strictly inside y. If x is the intersection of y and z, and part of z is outside y, then x doesn't extend all the way to z's boundary in those regions where z extends outside y. This means x doesn't touch z's boundary in those regions.

But in the regions where z's boundary is inside y, x could touch z's boundary. If x is the intersection of y and z, then x would touch z's boundary at all points where z's boundary is inside y. So, the relation would be TPP(x,z).

But hang on, I'm still not sure if x can be exactly the intersection of y and z given the constraints. Let's think about it in terms of the boundaries.

Let's denote the boundary of a region r as ∂r. Now, consider the case where x is the intersection of y and z, and NTPP(x,y).

For any point p on the boundary of x (p ∈ ∂x), p is either on the boundary of y (p ∈ ∂y) or on the boundary of z (p ∈ ∂z). But since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary, so p ∉ ∂y. This means p ∈ ∂z.

So, the boundary of x is a subset of the boundary of z, and x touches z's boundary. This means the relation is TPP(x,z).

But this assumes that x is exactly the intersection of y and z. Can this be the case given the constraints? Let's see.

The intersection of y and z, denoted as y ∩ z, is a region that's common to both y and z. Given PO(y,z), this intersection is non-empty and proper (meaning it's not the entirety of either y or z).

If x = y ∩ z, then x is a proper part of both y and z. But NTPP(x,y) means x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For x to be exactly the intersection of y and z, the intersection should not touch y's boundary.

Is this possible given PO(y,z)? Yes, it's possible. Consider a scenario where y is a large circle, z is another large circle that partially overlaps with y, and the overlapping region doesn't touch y's boundary. In such a case, x could be exactly this overlapping region and still satisfy NTPP(x,y).

So, if x is exactly the intersection of y and z, and given the constraints, the relation would be TPP(x,z).

Actually, hang on. Let me verify this conclusion more carefully.

If x = y ∩ z, and we also have NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), then:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. Since x = y ∩ z, x is inside z.
3. The boundary of x consists of parts of y's boundary and parts of z's boundary.
4. But from (1), x doesn't touch y's boundary. So, the boundary of x consists solely of parts of z's boundary inside y.
5. This means x touches z's boundary.

So, if x = y ∩ z, the relation would be TPP(x,z).

Hmm, let me recheck this in a different way. 

OK, let's think of a concrete example to check this conclusion.

Imagine y as a large circle centered at the origin with radius 2, and z as another large circle centered at (1, 0) with radius 1.5. These two circles partially overlap, so PO(y,z). The intersection of y and z, which is y ∩ z, is a lens-shaped region.

Hmm, I'm actually not sure this example satisfies all constraints.

Let's rethink. Actually, we know that y and z partially overlap. This means there's a region common to both y and z, but neither is a subregion of the other. If x is strictly inside y, and z partially overlaps with y, then there are three possibilities for x:

1. x is entirely within the part of y that's inside z.
2. x is entirely within the part of y that's outside z.
3. x is partly inside the part of y that's inside z and partly inside the part of y that's outside z.

In case 1, x is inside both y and z. Since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary. But it might touch z's boundary inside y. So, the relation is either NTPP(x,z) or TPP(x,z).

In case 2, x and z are disconnected, so the relation is DC(x,z).

In case 3, x and z partially overlap, so the relation is PO(x,z).

Let's add one more case:

4. x is exactly the part of y that's inside z (i.e., x = y ∩ z).

In this case, since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary. But the intersection of y and z can touch y's boundary at points where y's boundary intersects z's boundary. So, if x = y ∩ z, it would touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). Hence, case 4 is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

But wait, I think I'm contradicting myself here. Let me rethink this.

Let's consider the case where x = y ∩ z. Given PO(y,z), the intersection of y and z, denoted as y ∩ z, is a non-empty and proper subregion of both y and z.

If x = y ∩ z, then x is inside both y and z. But NTPP(x,y) means x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For x to be exactly the intersection of y and z, the intersection should not touch y's boundary.

But if PO(y,z), the intersection of y and z can touch y's boundary at points where y's boundary intersects z's boundary. So, it seems like x can't be exactly y ∩ z given the constraints.

Let me rethink this.

Actually, I think my analysis is correct. The intersection of y and z, given PO(y,z), can touch y's boundary at points where y's boundary intersects z's boundary. If x is strictly inside y (NTPP(x,y)), then x can't touch y's boundary. So, x can't be exactly the intersection of y and z.

Let's get back to the original three cases:

1. x is entirely within the part of y that's inside z.
2. x is entirely within the part of y that's outside z.
3. x is partly inside the part of y that's inside z and partly inside the part of y that's outside z.

In case 1, x is inside z. Since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary. But it might touch z's boundary inside y. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, the relation is NTPP(x,z). If x touches z's boundary, the relation is TPP(x,z).

In case 2, x and z are disconnected, so the relation is DC(x,z).

In case 3, x and z partially overlap, so the relation is PO(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Let me quickly go over the possible cases one more time to confirm:

1. x is entirely within the region y ∩ z:
   - If x doesn't touch the boundary of this region, then the relation is NTPP(x,z).
   - If x touches the boundary of this region (which can include parts of z's boundary inside y), then the relation is TPP(x,z).

2. x is entirely within y and outside z:
   - In this case, x and z are disconnected, so the relation is DC(x,z).

3. x is partly within y ∩ z and partly within y and outside z:
   - In this case, x and z partially overlap, so the relation is PO(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

One more thing to check. I should consider if I could have NTPP(x,z). Let's assume NTPP(x,z) is true. If so, it means x is strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So, x is strictly inside both y and z.

But if PO(y,z), then y and z overlap, but neither is entirely inside the other. This means x is inside the overlapping region of y and z, which is consistent with our assumption. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

Same for TPP(x,z). Let's assume TPP(x,z) is true. If so, it means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. But if x touches z's boundary, it must do so at points where z's boundary is inside y. This is possible.

Let's check DC(x,z). If DC(x,z) is true, it means x and z are disconnected. Given that NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y. If z and y overlap, but x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z are disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

Finally, let's check PO(x,z). If PO(x,z) is true, it means x and z overlap, but neither is entirely inside the other. Given that NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y. If x is partly in the overlapping region of y and z and partly in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z would partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

This matches our earlier conclusion. So I'm fairly confident this is correct. Let me now check if there are any other relations in RCC-8 that we've missed. In RCC-8, there are eight relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

I've already confirmed that DC, PO, TPP, and NTPP are possible. Let's check the others:

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Given NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If z and y overlap, and x touches z's boundary inside y, then x and z would share some interior parts (since the overlapping region of y and z has a non-empty interior). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But given NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y. If z is inside x, and given PO(y,z), z must be inside the overlapping region of y and z. But PO(y,z) means neither y nor z is entirely inside the other, which contradicts z being inside x (which is inside y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The reasoning is similar to TPPi. It's not possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But given NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y. And given PO(y,z), z is not entirely inside y. So, x and z can't be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

Actually, I should be a bit more careful with the TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) cases. Let's ensure we've really ruled them out.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If z is inside x, and x is inside y, then z is inside y. But PO(y,z) means y and z overlap, but neither is entirely inside the other. So, z can't be entirely inside y, which contradicts z being inside x (which is inside y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The reasoning is similar to TPPi. It's not possible.

So, our conclusion remains the same. The possible relations between x and z are:
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)

The final possible relationships between x and z are: NTPP(x,z), TPP(x,z), PO(x,z), and DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some space, but neither is contained in the other)

Given these conditions, I'll analyze the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z:
   - If x doesn't touch z's boundary: NTPP(x,z)
   - If x touches z's boundary (where z's boundary passes through y's interior): TPP(x,z)

2. If x is entirely within y but outside z:
   - In this case, x and z are disconnected: DC(x,z)

3. If x is partly within the overlapping region of y and z and partly within y but outside z:
   - In this case, x and z partially overlap: PO(x,z)

Other RCC-8 relations (EC, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible given our constraints.
