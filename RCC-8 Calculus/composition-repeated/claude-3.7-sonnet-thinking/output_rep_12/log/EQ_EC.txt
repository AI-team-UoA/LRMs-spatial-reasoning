PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Now, we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same region. They have the same interior and the same boundary. This means that any spatial relationship that y has with another region, x will also have the same relationship with that region.

Given that EC(y,z), meaning y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts, and x is coincident with y, it follows that x and z will also touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:

If EQ(x,y), then x and y have the same spatial extent.
If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
Since x and y have the same spatial extent, x will also touch z at a boundary without sharing any interior parts.

So, EC(x,z) is the correct answer.

Actually, let me further confirm this by considering the formal properties of these spatial relations:

1. EQ(x,y) means that x and y have the same interior and boundary.
2. EC(y,z) means that the boundaries of y and z intersect, but their interiors do not.

Given these properties, it follows that:
- The boundary of x is the same as the boundary of y.
- The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z.
- Therefore, the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of z.

- The interior of x is the same as the interior of y.
- The interior of y does not intersect with the interior of z.
- Therefore, the interior of x does not intersect with the interior of z.

These conditions exactly define EC(x,z).

So, the answer is: EC(x,z).

Actually, let me be more methodical. Let's list out the properties of each relation:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. No parts of x and y overlap.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they have the same interior and boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

For x and z:
- Since x and y are coincident, they have the same boundary.
- Since y and z touch at a boundary, x and z will also touch at a boundary.
- Since y and z do not share any interior parts, x and z will also not share any interior parts.

This fits the definition of EC(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is: EC(x,z).

However, let me double check by considering the composition table for RCC-8. The composition of relations is denoted by a semicolon. In this context, EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) can be written as (EQ ; EC)(x,z).

The composition table for RCC-8 tells us what spatial relations are possible between two regions given their relations to a third region.

For (EQ ; EC), the result is EC, meaning if EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), then EC(x,z).

This confirms our reasoning.

So, the answer is: EC(x,z).

On second thought, I think I'm overthinking this. If EQ(x,y), then x and y are the same region. If y is EC to z, then x, being the same as y, is also EC to z.

Let me double check my reasoning again.

If EQ(x,y), then:
- x and y have the same interior.
- x and y have the same boundary.

If EC(y,z), then:
- The boundaries of y and z intersect.
- The interiors of y and z do not intersect.

Given the above, it follows that:
- The boundaries of x and z intersect (since x's boundary is the same as y's boundary).
- The interiors of x and z do not intersect (since x's interior is the same as y's interior).

This is exactly the definition of EC(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is: EC(x,z).

Actually, I realize I'm thinking about this in a very complicated way. Let's simplify:

If EQ(x,y), then x and y are identical in terms of their spatial extent.
If y is in some relation R with z, then x, being identical to y, is also in relation R with z.

So, if EC(y,z), then EC(x,z).

In summary, the answer is: EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to analyze what these conditions tell us.

EQ(x,y) means:
- x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- x and y have identical boundaries and interiors

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z do not share any interior parts

Since x and y are coincident (EQ), they have the same spatial properties. Therefore, x must have the same relationship with z that y has with z.

Given that y is externally connected (EC) to z, x must also be externally connected to z.
