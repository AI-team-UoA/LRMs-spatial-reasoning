PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm being asked to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's break this down:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

2. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They share no spatial parts.

Now, I need to figure out what relations are possible between x and z. Let's consider each of the 8 relations in RCC-8:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected?
   Given that y is part of x and y is disconnected from z, we can say that there might be parts of x that don't overlap with y. If z is located in those parts or outside of x completely, then x and z can be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to externally connect?
   If z is positioned such that it touches the boundary of x but doesn't overlap with y (which is part of x), then EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap?
   If z overlaps with a part of x that doesn't include y, then x and z can partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z?
   If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is inside x and disconnected from z, then TPP(x,z) is possible.
   Wait, this seems contradictory. If y is part of x and x is part of z, then y must be part of z, which would mean they're not disconnected. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Similarly, if x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, and y is inside x, then y must be inside z too, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x?
   If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is also inside x but disconnected from z, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is also inside x but disconnected from z, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be equal?
   If x and z are the same region, and y is inside x, then y and z would overlap, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me re-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), if x is a tangential proper part of z, then every part of x is a part of z. Given that y is a part of x (since TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x), then y must also be a part of z. But this contradicts DC(y,z), which states that y and z are disconnected. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), the reasoning is similar. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then every part of x is a part of z. Since y is a part of x, y must also be a part of z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), if z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is also a part of x, it's possible for y and z to be disconnected within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, it's possible for y and z to be disconnected within x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For DC(x,z), if x and z are disconnected, then no part of x overlaps with z. Since y is a part of x, y and z would also be disconnected, which aligns with DC(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I think I made a logical error above. If TPPi(x,y), then y is not a part of x; rather, x is a part of y (specifically, x is a tangential proper part of y). This is because TPPi is the inverse of TPP. 

So, let's redo the analysis:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

2. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They share no spatial parts.

Now, let's consider each relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, and y is inside x, then y and z would also be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z externally connect (touch at the boundary), and y is inside x but doesn't touch the specific part of x's boundary that connects with z, then y and z would be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, and y is inside x but doesn't overlap with the shared region of x and z, then y and z would be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y would also be inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if y is inside x, y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y is also inside x and doesn't overlap with z, then y and z would be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If y is also inside x and doesn't overlap with z, then y and z would be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y is inside x, then y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me think one more time. I think my latest reasoning is correct. The possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more careful here. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x (strictly contained in x) and y touches the boundary of x.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected; they don't share any points.

Now, let's reason carefully:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. Given that y is a part of x, and y and z are disconnected, it's consistent for x and z to be disconnected as well. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z externally connect, they share boundary points but no interior points. If y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x, there's a possibility that y touches the same part of the boundary of x that x shares with z. In such a case, y and z might share a point, contradicting DC(y,z). However, y could also touch a different part of the boundary of x, in which case y and z wouldn't share any points, aligning with DC(y,z). So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points. If y is inside x and y and z are disconnected, then y can't be in the region where x and z overlap. It's possible for y to be in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z, making PO(x,z) consistent with DC(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y would also be inside z, which might contradict DC(y,z) if they share points. However, I realized that I'm being too restrictive. TPP(x,z) just means x is a proper part of z and they share boundary points. It doesn't necessarily mean every part of x touches z's boundary. So, it's possible for y to be inside x (and thus inside z) without sharing any points with z, aligning with DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

Hmm, let me reconsider. If TPP(x,z), then x is inside z. If y is a part of x, then y is inside z as well. For DC(y,z), y and z must be completely separate, which isn't the case if y is inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y is also inside x and doesn't overlap with z, then y and z would be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If y is also inside x and doesn't overlap with z, then y and z would be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y is inside x, then y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think I misunderstood something for case 4 (TPP(x,z)). Let me revisit it.

TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If y is a proper part of x (which follows from TPPi(x,y)), then y must be inside x. If x is inside z, then y must also be inside z. But if y is inside z, it can't be disconnected from z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

The possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I need to think more about EC(x,z). If EC(x,z), then x and z share only boundary points. If y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, there's a possibility that y touches the same part of the boundary of x that x shares with z. In this case, y and z might share a point, contradicting DC(y,z).

But on second thought, even if y touches the boundary of x (which is what TPPi(x,y) implies), it doesn't mean y touches every part of the boundary of x. So, y could touch a part of the boundary of x that doesn't connect with z.

So, EC(x,z) is possible if y doesn't touch the specific part of the boundary of x that x shares with z.

OK, let's go back to the beginning and try to be as careful as possible.

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. Let's denote the region of x excluding y as x'.

2. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected; they don't share any points.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. Given that y is inside x, if x and z are disconnected, then y and z would also be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z externally connect, they share only boundary points. If y touches the boundary of x (which is what TPPi(x,y) implies), there's a possibility that y touches the same part of the boundary of x that x shares with z. In this case, y and z might share a point, contradicting DC(y,z).

However, y doesn't need to touch every part of the boundary of x. If y touches a part of the boundary of x that doesn't connect with z, then y and z wouldn't share any points, aligning with DC(y,z). So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points. Let's denote the overlapping region as O. For DC(y,z) to be true, y should not overlap with O. This is possible if y is inside x' (the region of x excluding y). So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Given that y is inside x, y would also be inside z. But if y is inside z, it would share points with z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, if y is inside x, y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is also inside x, for DC(y,z) to be true, y and z should not share any points. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, if y is also inside x, for DC(y,z) to be true, y and z should not share any points. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y is inside x, then y would also be inside z. But if y is inside z, it would share points with z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, let me analyze PO(x,z) one more time. If PO(x,z), then x and z share some interior points (denoted as region O). For DC(y,z) to be true, y should not overlap with O. But y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), so y is inside x. If y is completely inside the part of x that doesn't overlap with z, then PO(x,z) is possible. But if y overlaps with O, then y and z would share points, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, PO(x,z) is possible only if y is positioned in a specific way inside x.

Actually, I realized the confusion stemmed from my understanding of "y is inside x." When I say y is inside x, I mean y is a subset of x, not necessarily a subset of the interior of x.

For clarity, let me use the terms "part of" to denote subset, and "interior" to denote the interior of a region.

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x (strict subset of x) and y touches the boundary of x.

2. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected; they don't share any points.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. Given that y is a part of x, if x and z are disconnected, then y and z would also be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z externally connect, they share only boundary points. Given that y is a part of x and touches the boundary of x, it's possible that y touches the same part of the boundary of x that x shares with z. In this case, y and z might share a point, contradicting DC(y,z).

However, y doesn't need to touch every part of the boundary of x. If y touches a part of the boundary of x that doesn't connect with z, then y and z wouldn't share any points, aligning with DC(y,z). So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points. For DC(y,z) to be true, y should not overlap with the region where x and z overlap. This is possible if y is positioned in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is a strict subset of z and touches the boundary of z. Given that y is a part of x, y would also be a part of z. But if y is a part of z, it would share points with z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is a strict subset of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, if y is a part of x, y would also be a part of z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is a strict subset of x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is also a part of x, for DC(y,z) to be true, y and z should not share any points. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is a strict subset of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, if y is also a part of x, for DC(y,z) to be true, y and z should not share any points. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y is a part of x, then y would also be a part of z. But if y is a part of z, it would share points with z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized I had a small issue in my understanding. Let me restate and be very clear: When we say y is a "part" of x in the context of RCC-8, we mean that y is a subset of x. And when we say y "touches" the boundary of x, we mean that y shares some boundary points with x.

With that in mind, let's redo the analysis:

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a strict subset of x and y shares some boundary points with x.

2. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected; they don't share any points.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. Given that y is a subset of x, if x and z are disconnected, then y and z would also be disconnected. This aligns with DC(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z externally connect, they share only boundary points. Given that y is a subset of x and shares some boundary points with x, there's a possibility that y shares the same boundary points with x that x shares with z. In this case, y and z would share some points, contradicting DC(y,z).

However, y doesn't need to share every boundary point of x. If y shares boundary points with x that x doesn't share with z, then y and z wouldn't share any points, aligning with DC(y,z). So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior and possibly some boundary points. For DC(y,z) to be true, y should not share any points with z. This is possible if y is positioned in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is a strict subset of z and shares some boundary points with z. Given that y is a subset of x, y would also be a subset of z. But if y is a subset of z, it would share points with z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is a strict subset of z and doesn't share any boundary points with z. Again, if y is a subset of x, y would also be a subset of z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is a strict subset of x and shares some boundary points with x. Given that y is also a subset of x, for DC(y,z) to be true, y and z should not share any points. This is possible if y and z are disjoint subsets of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is a strict subset of x and doesn't share any boundary points with x. Again, if y is also a subset of x, for DC(y,z) to be true, y and z should not share any points. This is possible if y and z are disjoint subsets of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y is a subset of x, then y would also be a subset of z. But if y is a subset of z, it would share points with z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm pretty sure my reasoning in the last attempt was correct.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no points)

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x and z share no points, then y (which is inside x) would also share no points with z, consistent with DC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x and z touch only at their boundaries, and y touches x's boundary but not at the specific points where x touches z, then y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x and z partially overlap, y can be positioned within the portion of x that doesn't overlap with z, maintaining DC(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y would be completely inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z and y can be separate regions within x that don't share points.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z and y can be separate regions within x that don't share points.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).
