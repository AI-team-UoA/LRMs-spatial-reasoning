PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's step through this problem methodically. We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

Now, let's determine what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are essentially the same region in space. In other words, y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent. Any relation that holds between an object and y would also hold between that object and z.

Therefore, if TPP(x,y), then the same relation should hold between x and z, i.e., TPP(x,z).

To double-check, let's verify this by considering the definitions:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident.

If y and z are coincident, then they have the same boundary. Since x touches y's boundary, it would also touch z's boundary. Similarly, since x is part of y, and y is the same as z, then x is also part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me re-think this from first principles to be sure. We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y (it's contained in y but not equal to y) and x touches the boundary of y.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are equal, meaning they occupy the same spatial region.

What does this tell us about x and z?

If y and z are equal, then any relationship that x has with y, x will also have with z. Since x is a tangential proper part of y, x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

So, the answer is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more careful about this. Let me check if there's any subtle difference that might arise.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are equal.

Given that y and z are equal, they have the same interior and the same boundary. Since x is a proper part of y, it's also a proper part of z. Since x touches y's boundary, it also touches z's boundary.

I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Wait, let me be even more systematic about this. Let's think about the properties of these relations:

1. TPP(x,y) means:
   - x is a proper part of y.
   - x touches the boundary of y.

2. EQ(y,z) means:
   - y and z occupy the same space.
   - They have the same interior and boundary.

Now, let's deduce what this means for x and z:
- Given EQ(y,z), y and z are the same region. So, the boundary of y is the same as the boundary of z, and the interior of y is the same as the interior of z.
- Given TPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y. Since y and z are the same region, x is also a proper part of z.
- Given TPP(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. Since the boundary of y is the same as the boundary of z, x also touches the boundary of z.

Given the above, x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z, which means TPP(x,z).

I'm confident in my answer now. If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z).

Actually, looking at this more carefully, let me consider the transitivity properties of these relations.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are equal.

The transitivity rule for this scenario would be: TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) implies TPP(x,z).

Let's verify this by considering the underlying spatial meaning:
- TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.
- If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y is the same as z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

This confirms that TPP(x,z) is the correct relationship between x and z.

Let's consider the formal composition table for RCC-8 to make absolutely sure. In the composition table, we'd look at the entry for TPP o EQ, which gives the possible relations between x and z given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

From the composition properties of RCC-8:
- TPP o EQ = TPP (meaning if TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z)).

This confirms my reasoning.

In conclusion, if TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check the RCC-8 composition table to be certain. In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition of TPP with EQ is indeed TPP, which means that if we have TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then the only possible relation between x and z is TPP(x,z).

This reaffirms my earlier conclusion.

Actually, let me think more carefully about the meaning of EQ(y,z). In RCC-8, EQ(y,z) means that y and z are spatially equivalent, occupying the same space. If two regions are spatially equivalent, then they must have the same interior and the same boundary.

Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y (x is fully inside y but not equal to y) and x touches the boundary of y.

Now, since EQ(y,z), y and z have the same interior and boundary. Given that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, it follows that x is also a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

This means that TPP(x,z) holds.

So, the answer to the question is: TPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been a bit unclear in my reasoning. Let me be more specific about the definitions:

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y: This means x is fully contained within y, and x is not equal to y.
- x touches the boundary of y: This means some part of x is in contact with the boundary of y.

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z occupy the same space: This means y and z have the same interior and the same boundary.

Now, if we have TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), what is the relationship between x and z?

Since EQ(y,z), y and z have the same interior and boundary. Given that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, x must also be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary.

This means TPP(x,z) holds.

But, just to be 100% certain, let's think of this in terms of set operations (which align with the intuitive spatial meaning):

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper subset of y: This means x is fully contained within y, and x is not equal to y.
- x touches the boundary of y: This means there exists at least one point p such that p is in x and p is on the boundary of y.

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z are the same set: This means any point that's in y is also in z, and vice versa.

Now, if we have TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), what is the relationship between x and z?

Since x is a proper subset of y and y is the same as z, it follows that x is a proper subset of z. Also, since there exists a point p such that p is in x and p is on the boundary of y, and since y and z have the same boundary, the point p is also on the boundary of z.

This means TPP(x,z) holds.

I'm very confident in my answer: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z).

Actually, I've realized I might have misunderstood the meaning of "EQ(y,z)" in the context of the question. Let me revisit the original definition.

In RCC-8, EQ(y,z) means that regions y and z are spatially coincident, meaning they occupy the same space. This is equivalent to saying that both y is a part of z and z is a part of y, which implies they are identical in terms of their spatial extent.

Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. Since y and z are identical (given EQ(y,z)), the relationship between x and z would be the same as the relationship between x and y.

Therefore, if TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z).

OK, I've convinced myself, and the answer is that if TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they have identical boundaries and interiors. This means:
- If x is contained in y, x must also be contained in z
- If x touches y's boundary, x must also touch z's boundary

Therefore, all the properties that define TPP(x,y) also apply to the relationship between x and z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
