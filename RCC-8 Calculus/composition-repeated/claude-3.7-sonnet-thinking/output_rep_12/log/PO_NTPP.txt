PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

We need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Let's analyze the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? 
   Since y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), at least the part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z. So x and z must share some part, which means they cannot be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected (i.e., touch at the boundary but don't share interior)? 
   Since y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x overlaps with y (shares interior with y), at least part of x must be inside z (sharing interior with z). This contradicts the definition of EC. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? 
   We know that part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y). But can part of x be outside z? Yes, because PO(x,y) means that part of x is not in y, and that part could be outside z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? 
   This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. We know that part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y). It's possible that the rest of x is also inside z and some part of x touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? 
   This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We know that part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y). It's possible that the rest of x is also inside z and no part of x touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? 
   This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x only partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)). This means part of y, and therefore part of z, is not overlapping with x, contradicting that z would be completely inside x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? 
   Similar to the TPPi case, this would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But since y is completely inside z, and x only partially overlaps with y, part of z would not overlap with x, contradicting that z would be completely inside x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? 
   If x and z were equal, then since y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), y would also be completely inside x. But we know that x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)), which means neither is completely inside the other. This is a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me double-check each of these.

For PO(x,z):
- We know that part of x overlaps with y, and y is completely within z. So part of x is within z.
- For PO, we also need part of x to be outside z.
- Since PO(x,y), part of x is outside y. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's outside z, since y is a proper part of z.

Let me think more carefully...

For PO(x,y), we know:
- x and y share some interior parts.
- Some part of x is outside y.
- Some part of y is outside x.

For NTPP(y,z), we know:
- y is completely inside z.
- y does not touch the boundary of z.

So where can x be in relation to z?

The part of x that overlaps with y is definitely inside z (because y is inside z).
The part of x that is outside y could either be inside z or outside z.

If all of x is inside z, then either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would hold, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.

If part of x is inside z (at least the part that overlaps with y) and part of x is outside z, then PO(x,z) would hold.

So the possible relations are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check again to make sure I'm not missing anything or making an error...

Actually, I think I need to be a bit more careful in my analysis. 

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some parts, but neither is a part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Let's think about this in terms of set theory. If we treat regions as sets:
- PO(x,y) means x ∩ y ≠ ∅, x - y ≠ ∅, and y - x ≠ ∅.
- NTPP(y,z) means y ⊂ z (y is a proper subset of z) and y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x ∩ z = ∅. But we know that x ∩ y ≠ ∅ (from PO(x,y)) and y ⊂ z (from NTPP(y,z)). So, at least the part of x that overlaps with y must also overlap with z. Therefore, x ∩ z ≠ ∅, which contradicts DC(x,z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z only touch at their boundaries, with no interior overlap. But from PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we know that x has an interior overlap with y, and y is completely inside z without touching its boundary. Therefore, x must have an interior overlap with z, which contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x ∩ z ≠ ∅, x - z ≠ ∅, and z - x ≠ ∅. We've already established that x ∩ z ≠ ∅. 
   - Can x - z ≠ ∅? Yes, because x is not a subset of y (from PO(x,y)), and there's no guarantee that the part of x outside y is inside z. So, x - z can be non-empty.
   - Can z - x ≠ ∅? Since y is a proper subset of z (from NTPP(y,z)), and not all of y is inside x (from PO(x,y)), there's a part of z (at least the part of y that's not in x) that's not in x. So, z - x ≠ ∅.
   Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x ⊂ z and x touches the boundary of z. 
   - Can x be a subset of z? It's possible. We know that part of x is inside y (from PO(x,y)), and y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)). The part of x outside y could still be inside z. 
   - Can x touch the boundary of z? Yes, the part of x outside y could touch the boundary of z.
   Therefore, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x ⊂ z and x does not touch the boundary of z. Similarly to TPP, it's possible for all of x to be inside z. And if the part of x outside y doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) holds. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This means z ⊂ x and z touches the boundary of x. But since y is a proper subset of z (from NTPP(y,z)), and not all of y is inside x (from PO(x,y)), there's a part of z that's not in x, which contradicts z ⊂ x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This means z ⊂ x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Similar to TPPi, since not all of z is inside x, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x = z. If x = z, then given NTPP(y,z), we would have NTPP(y,x). But this contradicts PO(x,y). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'll now justify why these three relations are possible by showing scenarios:

- PO(x,z): Imagine y is a small circle in the middle of a larger circle z. Now, if x is a circle that overlaps with half of y and extends out of z, then x and z would partially overlap.

- TPP(x,z): Keep the same scenario with y as a small circle in the middle of z. Now, if x is a circle that overlaps with half of y but is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z, then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

- NTPP(x,z): Same scenario with y in the middle of z. If x is a circle that overlaps with half of y, is completely inside z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me actually draw this out to make sure.

For PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):

Imagine:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary.
- x is a shape that overlaps with part of y (but not all) and extends both outside of y and outside of z.

In this scenario:
- x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)).
- y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)).
- x and z partially overlap (PO(x,z)).

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine the same z and y, but now x is a shape that overlaps with part of y (but not all), is entirely inside z, and touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
Imagine the same z and y, but now x is a shape that overlaps with part of y (but not all), is entirely inside z, and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, the three possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I think this is the correct answer!

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z based on the given information:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, so x must share some part with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because the part of x that overlaps with y must be in the interior of z (since y is in the interior of z).

3. PO(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x can extend outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible because y is inside z, and x only partially overlaps with y, so z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x=z, then y would be inside x, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
