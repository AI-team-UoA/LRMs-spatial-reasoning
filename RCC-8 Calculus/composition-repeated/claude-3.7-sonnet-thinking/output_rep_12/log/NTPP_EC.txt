PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this step by step, considering the meaning of each relation.

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, so they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now I need to determine what relationship(s) could hold between x and z given these constraints.

Given that:
- x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- y touches z only at their boundaries

The key insight is that x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z only touches y at the boundary. This means that x and z cannot share any points, because:
- x is strictly in y's interior
- z only touches y at y's boundary
- x and y's boundary are disjoint

Therefore, x and z must be disconnected, which corresponds to the DC relation: DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this by considering each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This seems possible given the constraints.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is impossible because x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch z which only touches y's boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is impossible because z doesn't overlap with y at all (only touches its boundary), so z cannot overlap with x which is inside y.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is impossible because x is inside y, and z is outside y except at the boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is impossible for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because z extends outside of y, while x is completely inside y.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is impossible because x is inside y while z is outside y except at the boundary.

So the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider this. I need to be careful about spatial reasoning.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap

The key fact is that x is strictly in the interior of y, while z only touches y at the boundary. This means that x and z cannot share any points, because x doesn't extend to y's boundary where z touches y.

So the relation must be DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.

Actually, I realize that I need to reconsider if there are any other possibilities.

Let me think again: 
- NTPP(x,y) means x is fully inside y, not touching y's boundary
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch only at their boundaries

Since x is fully in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, there's no way for x and z to share any points or even touch. They must be disconnected.

So the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

Actually, one more check. Let's consider whether it's possible for x to touch or overlap with z in any way:

- For x and z to touch (EC), they would need to share a boundary point. But x doesn't touch y's boundary at all, and z only touches y at the boundary, so they can't touch.
- For x and z to overlap (PO), they would need to share interior points. But z doesn't share interior points with y (only boundary points), so it can't share interior points with x which is fully inside y.
- For x to be part of z (TPP or NTPP), z would need to contain x, which is impossible since z is outside y except at the boundary, while x is fully inside y.
- For z to be part of x (TPPi or NTPPi), x would need to contain z, which is impossible since x is fully inside y, while z extends outside y.
- For x and z to be equal (EQ), they would need to be the same region, which is impossible since x is inside y and z is mostly outside y.

So DC(x,z) is indeed the only possible relation.

### Answer: DC(x,z)

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to consider what NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) tell us about the possible relationship between x and z.

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely inside y
- x does not touch y's boundary (non-tangential)

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share any interior points

Since x is strictly in the interior of y (not touching y's boundary), and z only touches y at y's boundary, there's no way for x and z to share any points or even touch each other. 

Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
