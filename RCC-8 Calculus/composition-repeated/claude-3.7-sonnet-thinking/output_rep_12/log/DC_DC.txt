PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

In this problem, I need to determine what are the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ if we know that $DC(x,y)$ and $DC(y,z)$.

$DC(x,y)$ means $x$ and $y$ are disconnected, i.e., they do not share any points or touch each other.
$DC(y,z)$ means $y$ and $z$ are disconnected as well.

Let me think about what this means for the relationship between $x$ and $z$. Since $x$ and $y$ are disconnected, and $y$ and $z$ are disconnected, $x$ and $z$ can be in any of the possible relations. Let me go through each one:

1. $DC(x,z)$: This is possible. $x$ and $z$ can be disconnected from each other, and also both disconnected from $y$.

2. $EC(x,z)$: This is possible. $x$ and $z$ can touch at a boundary but not share any interior points, while both being disconnected from $y$.

3. $PO(x,z)$: This is possible. $x$ and $z$ can partially overlap, sharing some interior points, while both being disconnected from $y$.

4. $TPP(x,z)$: This is possible. $x$ can be a tangential proper part of $z$, i.e., $x$ is entirely inside $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary, while both $x$ and $z$ are disconnected from $y$.

5. $NTPP(x,z)$: This is possible. $x$ can be a non-tangential proper part of $z$, i.e., $x$ is entirely inside $z$ and does not touch $z$'s boundary, while both $x$ and $z$ are disconnected from $y$.

6. $TPPi(x,z)$: This is possible. $z$ can be a tangential proper part of $x$, i.e., $z$ is entirely inside $x$ and touches $x$'s boundary, while both $x$ and $z$ are disconnected from $y$.

7. $NTPPi(x,z)$: This is possible. $z$ can be a non-tangential proper part of $x$, i.e., $z$ is entirely inside $x$ and does not touch $x$'s boundary, while both $x$ and $z$ are disconnected from $y$.

8. $EQ(x,z)$: This is possible. $x$ and $z$ can be coincident, i.e., they occupy the same space, while both being disconnected from $y$.

So, all eight possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are possible given $DC(x,y)$ and $DC(y,z)$.

Actually, let me double check this more carefully and see if there are any constraints.

Let's consider three objects $x$, $y$, and $z$ in a 2D space.

Given: $DC(x,y)$ and $DC(y,z)$, which means $x$ and $y$ are disconnected, and $y$ and $z$ are disconnected.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between $x$ and $z$:

1. $DC(x,z)$: Clearly possible. For example, imagine three disks that are all distant from each other.

2. $EC(x,z)$: Also possible. Imagine $y$ as a disk at the origin, $x$ as a disk to the left of $y$, and $z$ as a disk to the right of $y$. $x$ and $z$ can be positioned to touch each other while both being disconnected from $y$.

3. $PO(x,z)$: Possible. Again, imagine $y$ as a disk at the origin. $x$ and $z$ can be positioned to partially overlap each other while both being disconnected from $y$.

4. $TPP(x,z)$: Possible. $y$ can be disconnected from both $x$ and $z$, while $x$ is a tangential proper part of $z$.

5. $NTPP(x,z)$: Possible. $y$ can be disconnected from both $x$ and $z$, while $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $z$.

6. $TPPi(x,z)$: Possible, by symmetry with case 4.

7. $NTPPi(x,z)$: Possible, by symmetry with case 5.

8. $EQ(x,z)$: Possible. $x$ and $z$ can be coincident, occupying the same space, while both being disconnected from $y$.

So, all eight possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are possible given $DC(x,y)$ and $DC(y,z)$. There are no constraints on the relation between $x$ and $z$ in this case.

So the answer is that all possible 8 relations can hold between $x$ and $z$.

I need to think this through once more.

First, if $x$ and $y$ are disconnected, that means they don't share any points and don't touch at a boundary. If $y$ and $z$ are also disconnected, the same applies to them.

This means that $y$ is completely separate from both $x$ and $z$. Thus, there are no constraints on how $x$ and $z$ can relate to each other.

Indeed, $x$ and $z$ can be disconnected, they can touch, they can overlap, one can be inside the other, or they can be the same region. All of the eight relations are possible.

$DC(x,z)$: $x$ and $z$ can be completely disconnected, each disconnected from $y$.
$EC(x,z)$: $x$ and $z$ can touch at a boundary, both disconnected from $y$.
$PO(x,z)$: $x$ and $z$ can partially overlap, both disconnected from $y$.
$TPP(x,z)$: $x$ can be a tangential proper part of $z$, both disconnected from $y$.
$NTPP(x,z)$: $x$ can be a non-tangential proper part of $z$, both disconnected from $y$.
$TPPi(x,z)$: $z$ can be a tangential proper part of $x$, both disconnected from $y$.
$NTPPi(x,z)$: $z$ can be a non-tangential proper part of $x$, both disconnected from $y$.
$EQ(x,z)$: $x$ and $z$ can be equal, both disconnected from $y$.

So the answer is that all 8 possible relations can hold between $x$ and $z$.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Since DC means disconnected, we know that:
- x and y don't share any points and don't touch
- y and z don't share any points and don't touch

This means y is completely separate from both x and z, which places no constraints on how x and z can relate to each other.

Therefore, x and z could be in any of these relations:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident
