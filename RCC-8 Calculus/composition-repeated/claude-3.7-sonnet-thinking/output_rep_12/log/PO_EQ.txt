PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

I'm given two facts:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent, I can substitute z for y in the first relation.

So if PO(x,y) and y is identical to z, then the relationship between x and z must also be PO.

That is, PO(x,z) must hold.

Let me double-check this by considering the definitions of the relations:

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (identical in spatial extent).

If y and z are identical in spatial extent, then:
- If x shares a part with y but is not contained in y, then x must also share a part with z but not be contained in z.
- If y is not contained in x, then z is also not contained in x.

Therefore, PO(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given the constraints.

So the answer is: PO(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this once more to be sure. 

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region. This means that any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since PO(x,y) holds, and y is identical to z, then PO(x,z) must also hold.

So the final answer is: PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region), I can effectively substitute z for y in any spatial relation.

Therefore, if PO(x,y) holds (meaning x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial part but neither is contained in the other), and y is identical to z spatially, then the same relation must hold between x and z.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
