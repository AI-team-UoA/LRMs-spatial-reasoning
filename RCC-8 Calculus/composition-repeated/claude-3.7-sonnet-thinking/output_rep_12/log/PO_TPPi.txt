PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step:

1. PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z inverted, which is the same as TPP(z,y). This means that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
- x and y partially overlap (they share a part, but neither is contained in the other)
- z is a tangential proper part of y (z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Now, what could be the relationship between x and z?

Let's think about the possible configurations:

1. x and z might be disconnected (DC): This can happen if x and y overlap in a region that doesn't include z.
2. x and z might externally connect (EC): This can happen if x and y overlap in a region that doesn't include z, but x touches z at the boundary.
3. x and z might partially overlap (PO): This can happen if x overlaps with y in a way that it also overlaps with z, but neither x is contained in z nor z is contained in x.
4. x might be a tangential proper part of z (TPP): This doesn't seem possible because z is fully contained in y, and x is only partially contained in y. So, x cannot be fully contained in z.
5. x might be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP): Similarly, this doesn't seem possible.
6. z might be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi): This can happen if z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y.
7. z might be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi): This can happen if z is fully contained in x without touching x's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y.
8. x and z might be equal (EQ): This doesn't seem possible because x is only partially contained in y, while z is fully contained in y.

Wait, let me think more carefully. It's possible I've missed some configurations.

For TPP(x,z), I initially ruled it out. But let's reconsider: x partially overlaps with y, and z is a tangential proper part of y. It's possible that the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z. In that case, TPP(x,z) would hold.

For NTPP(x,z), similar to TPP, it's possible that the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. In that case, NTPP(x,z) would hold.

For EQ(x,z), it's possible that the part of x that overlaps with y is exactly z. In that case, x and z would be the same, and EQ(x,z) would hold.

Actually, let me rethink this even more systematically. We have:

- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(z,y): z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with x doesn't include z.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with x touches z at the boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with x also overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible because x is not fully contained in y (PO(x,y)), while z is fully contained in y (TPP(z,y)). If x were fully contained in z, then x would also be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y).
5. NTPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this doesn't seem possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with x fully contains z, and z touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with x fully contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. This doesn't seem immediately possible because x is not fully contained in y (PO(x,y)), while z is fully contained in y (TPP(z,y)).

Let me reconsider the TPP and NTPP cases.

For TPP(x,z), I said it's not possible. My reasoning was: If x is fully contained in z, and z is fully contained in y, then x would also be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). This reasoning holds, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), the same reasoning applies. If x is fully contained in z, and z is fully contained in y, then x would also be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). This reasoning holds, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), the reasoning is similar. If x is equal to z, and z is fully contained in y, then x would also be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). This reasoning holds, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But wait, let me double-check the cases of TPPi and NTPPi more carefully.

For TPPi(x,z), I said it's possible if the part of y that overlaps with x fully contains z, and z touches the boundary of x. But there's a concern: if z touches the boundary of y (as given by TPP(z,y)), and x partially overlaps with y, it's not clear that z would necessarily touch the boundary of x.

Let's imagine a scenario:
- y is a big circle.
- z is a smaller circle contained within y, touching y's boundary at one point.
- x is a different circle that partially overlaps with y.

Now, it's possible that x overlaps with y in a way that z is fully contained in x. But since z touches the boundary of y, and x partially overlaps with y, z might or might not touch the boundary of x, depending on how x and y overlap.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible if z is contained in the overlap of x and y, and z touches the boundary of x.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is possible if z is contained in the overlap of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z remain:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Just to double-check, let's ensure that there isn't a scenario where x and z are equal. Given that TPP(z,y) and PO(x,y), it's not possible for x and z to be the same. If they were, then x would be a tangential proper part of y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the final set of possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Hmm, I'm still not fully convinced that these are all the possibilities. Let me try to approach this differently by using a composition table for RCC-8 relations:

Actually, I don't have access to a direct composition table for RCC-8 relations. Instead, let me use the definitions of the relations and think about this from scratch again.

1. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
2. TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we can consider each of the eight possible RCC-8 relations and check which ones are consistent with the given relations.

DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y)? Yes, it's possible that x overlaps with y in a region that doesn't include z.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y)? Yes, it's possible that x overlaps with y in a way that it just touches z at the boundary.

PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y)? Yes, it's possible that x overlaps with y in a way that it also partially overlaps with z.

TPP(x,z): This means x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y)? If x is fully contained in z, and z is fully contained in y, then x would also be fully contained in y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which states that neither x nor y is fully contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not consistent.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this is not consistent because if x is fully contained in z, and z is fully contained in y, then x would also be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y).

TPPi(x,z): This means z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y)? It's possible that the part of x that overlaps with y fully contains z, and z touches the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is consistent.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y)? It's possible that the part of x that overlaps with y fully contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is consistent.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y)? If x is the same as z, then x would be a tangential proper part of y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which states that neither x nor y is fully contained in the other. So, EQ(x,z) is not consistent.

Let me double-check the case of TPPi(x,z) again, since it requires careful consideration:

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that TPP(z,y) (z is a tangential proper part of y), and PO(x,y) (x and y share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other), we need to check if it's possible for z to be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary.

Let's consider a specific scenario: Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and x as another circle that overlaps with y. If x overlaps with y in a way that z is fully contained in the overlap of x and y, then z would be fully contained in x. Additionally, if z touches the boundary of x within the region of overlap, then TPPi(x,z) would hold.

But wait, I need to be more careful here. If z touches the boundary of y (as given by TPP(z,y)), and x partially overlaps with y, it's not immediately clear that z would touch the boundary of x. It would depend on the specific configuration.

Let's think of it geometrically: If z touches the boundary of y at a point p, and x and y overlap, then if p is in the overlapping region, z would not touch the boundary of x. But if p is not in the overlapping region, then z might touch the boundary of x, depending on the specific shape and arrangement of x, y, and z.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible, but it requires a specific arrangement.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. This is also possible, depending on the specific arrangement of x, y, and z.

Actually, I'm becoming clearer about the arrangement required for TPPi(x,z): If z touches the boundary of y at a point p, and this point p is also on the boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x, and TPPi(x,z) would hold. This can happen if z is fully contained in the overlap of x and y, and the point where z touches the boundary of y is also on the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But wait, I'm still not entirely convinced that these are all the possibilities. Let me try to think of a more concrete way to verify this.

One approach is to try to construct specific examples for each of the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y), and check if the constructions are consistent.

Let's consider 2D regions for simplicity, and construct the scenarios:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and x as another circle that overlaps with y in a region that doesn't include z. Clearly, x and z are disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and x as another circle that overlaps with y in a way that it just touches z at one point. Here, x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and x as another circle that overlaps with y in a way that it also partially overlaps with z. Here, x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For TPP(x,z) to hold, x needs to be fully contained in z and touch z's boundary. But if x is fully contained in z, and z is fully contained in y, then x would also be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is not possible because it would require x to be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y).

6. TPPi(x,z): For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z needs to be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary. Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and x as a larger circle that overlaps with y in a way that it fully contains z. If the point where z touches the boundary of y is also on the boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x. In this scenario, z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z needs to be fully contained in x and not touch x's boundary. Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and x as a larger circle that overlaps with y in a way that it fully contains z and the boundary of x is far from the point where z touches the boundary of y. In this scenario, z is fully contained in x but doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z need to be the same. But if x is the same as z, then x would be a tangential proper part of y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, as I'm working through the above cases, I'm realizing that my reasoning about TPPi(x,z) has a flaw. Specifically, I mentioned the possibility that "If the point where z touches the boundary of y is also on the boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x."

But, the point where z touches the boundary of y can't also be on the boundary of x if z is fully contained in x. If z is fully contained in x, then the boundary of z cannot extend beyond the boundary of x. This means the point where z touches the boundary of y cannot also be on the boundary of x.

So, if z touches the boundary of y (as given by TPP(z,y)), and z is fully contained in x, then z must necessarily touch the boundary of x as well. This makes TPPi(x,z) possible, but we need to be careful about the specific arrangement.

Let's revise the TPPi(x,z) case:

6. TPPi(x,z): For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z needs to be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary. Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and x as a larger circle that overlaps with y in a way that it fully contains z. The point where z touches the boundary of y must be within the overlapping region of x and y, but z should also touch the boundary of x at some other point within the overlapping region. In this scenario, z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Wait, my reasoning is still not right. Let me take a step back and think more carefully.

If z touches the boundary of y (as given by TPP(z,y)), and z is fully contained in x, then there must be a point p that is on both the boundary of z and the boundary of y. Since z is fully contained in x, the entire boundary of z is within x or on the boundary of x. 

If the point p is within x, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x at that point. If the point p is on the boundary of x, then z touches the boundary of x at that point.

So, for TPPi(x,z) to hold, z needs to be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary. This can happen if the point where z touches the boundary of y is also on the boundary of x. But, for this to be consistent with PO(x,y), x and y need to overlap in a way that their boundaries intersect at the point p.

Actually, I think my setup is making this problem overly complex. Let me approach the problem from a purely axiomatic standpoint, rather than trying to visualize specific examples. And I should probably really use the composition table for the RCC-8 relations.

There's a fundamental constraint in the RCC-8 calculus: if a region is a (tangential or non-tangential) proper part of another region, it is completely contained within the second region. This is a transitive property.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(z,y): z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary.

We're looking for the possible relations between x and z. We can systematically consider each RCC-8 relation and check if it's consistent with the given relations.

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is consistent because x partially overlaps with y, and z is fully contained in y. It's possible that the overlapping region of x and y doesn't include z. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. This is consistent for the same reason as DC, with the additional constraint that x and z touch at the boundary. This is also possible if the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of z within the region where x and y overlap. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is consistent because x partially overlaps with y, and z is fully contained in y. If the overlapping region of x and y includes part of z, but not all of z, then x and z would partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

TPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. For this to be consistent, x would need to be fully contained in z, and z is fully contained in y. By transitivity, x would also be fully contained in y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which states that neither x nor y is fully contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this would require x to be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent because z is fully contained in y, and x partially overlaps with y. If the overlapping region of x and y fully contains z, and z touches the boundary of x within the overlapping region, then TPPi(x,z) would hold. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also consistent with the given relations if the overlapping region of x and y fully contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x within the overlapping region. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. For this to be consistent, x would need to be the same as z, and z is fully contained in y. By transitivity, x would also be fully contained in y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which states that neither x nor y is fully contained in the other. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But actually I realize that there are more constraints involved in the case of TPPi(x,z) that I haven't fully accounted for. Let me think it through again.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that TPP(z,y) (z is a tangential proper part of y), and PO(x,y) (x and y share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other), we need to check if it's possible for z to be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary.

Let me try an alternate approach. In RCC-8, TPP(z,y) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This implies that z is spatially included in y, and the boundaries of z and y touch. Similarly, TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is spatially included in x, and the boundaries of z and x touch.

Given PO(x,y), the question is whether z can be a tangential proper part of x. If z is spatially included in y (as implied by TPP(z,y)), and x and y partially overlap, then z can be fully contained in the overlapping region of x and y. This would make z a proper part of x, but whether it's a tangential proper part depends on whether the boundaries of z and x touch.

If z touches the boundary of y (as implied by TPP(z,y)), and x and y partially overlap, then it's possible for z to touch the boundary of x as well, but it depends on the specific arrangement.

Let's think about a concrete example: Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and x as another circle that overlaps with y. If x fully contains z, and the point where z touches the boundary of y is also on the boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x, making TPPi(x,z) hold. But if the point where z touches the boundary of y is not on the boundary of x, then z wouldn't touch the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) hold.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible, but it requires a specific arrangement.

I realize the source of the confusion is that one needs to be careful about the specific arrangement of the regions, especially when considering the boundaries.

Let me explain through a specific example for TPPi(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point (let's call this point p), and x as another circle that overlaps with y. If x fully contains z, and the point p is on the boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x, making TPPi(x,z) hold. But if the point p is inside x and not on the boundary of x, then z wouldn't touch the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) hold.

I think there's still a problem with my reasoning above. Let's go back to the definitions.

TPP(z,y) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. Specifically, this means that z is a proper part of y (i.e., z is fully contained in y and z is not equal to y), and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y at some point.

TPPi(x,z) means the inverse of TPP(z,x), which is TPP(x,z). So, TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. Specifically, this means that z is a proper part of x, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of x at some point.

Given the above, and the fact that PO(x,y) (x and y share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other), can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))?

If TPP(z,y), then z is fully contained in y and touches the boundary of y. If TPPi(x,z), then z is fully contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

For both TPP(z,y) and TPPi(x,z) to be true, z needs to be fully contained in both x and y, and it needs to touch both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

Given PO(x,y), x and y overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other. For z to be fully contained in both x and y, z must be in the intersection of x and y.

Let me try a specific construction: Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point (let's call this point p), and x as another circle that overlaps with y. If the overlapping region of x and y fully contains z, and the point p is also on the boundary of x, then z would touch both the boundary of y and the boundary of x, making both TPP(z,y) and TPPi(x,z) hold.

But there's a constraint: for PO(x,y) to hold, neither x nor y can be fully contained in the other. So, if the boundary of z touches the boundary of y at the point p, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of x at some point q, then p and q must be within the overlapping region of x and y. Furthermore, for TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be fully contained in x, which means the entire boundary of z is inside or on the boundary of x.

But actually, p and q could be the same point. In other words, if z touches the boundary of y at the same point where it touches the boundary of x, and this point is in the overlapping region of x and y, then both TPP(z,y) and TPPi(x,z) would hold. But for PO(x,y) to hold, x and y cannot be fully contained in each other, which means there must be parts of x that are outside of y, and vice versa.

So I think if we have a point where the boundaries of x, y, and z all meet, then PO(x,y), TPP(z,y), and TPPi(x,z) could all hold. And I think the arrangement does need to be that specific. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z needs to be fully contained in x but not touch the boundary of x. This can be the case if z is fully contained in the overlapping region of x and y, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y at a point p, but p is inside x and not on the boundary of x. In this scenario, both TPP(z,y) and NTPPi(x,z) would hold. So NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

And I'm now confident that this is the complete set of possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

Let's double-check this by looking at the cases we ruled out:
- TPP(x,z): We ruled this out because it would require x to be fully contained in z, which, combined with the fact that z is fully contained in y, would imply that x is fully contained in y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which states that neither x nor y is fully contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.
- NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this would require x to be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.
- EQ(x,z): This would require x to be the same as z, which, combined with the fact that z is fully contained in y, would imply that x is fully contained in y. But this contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

These rulings seem to me to be correct.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm going to do one more check, going back to the constraint that z touches the boundary of y. This is because TPP(z,y) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, which means that z touches the boundary of y.

Let's review the cases again with this constraint in mind:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible because x partially overlaps with y, and z is fully contained in y and touches the boundary of y. It's possible that the overlapping region of x and y doesn't include z, making x and z disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. This is also possible. For instance, if z touches the boundary of y at a point p, and x overlaps with y in a way that the boundary of x passes through the point p, then x and z would touch at the boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible if the overlapping region of x and y includes part of z, but not all of z. z can touch the boundary of y at a point p, and this point may or may not be in the overlapping region of x and y.
- TPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. For this to be possible, the overlapping region of x and y must fully contain z, and z must touch the boundary of x at some point. If z touches the boundary of y at a point p, and p is also on the boundary of x, then both TPP(z,y) and TPPi(x,z) can hold.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For this to be possible, the overlapping region of x and y must fully contain z, and z must not touch the boundary of x at any point. If z touches the boundary of y at a point p, and p is inside x and not on the boundary of x, then both TPP(z,y) and NTPPi(x,z) can hold.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, considering the constraint that z touches the boundary of y, are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

So my original conclusion was correct: The set of possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

This is the final answer.

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me unpack what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some part, but neither contains the other)
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

Now I'll analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with y in an area that doesn't include z, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with y and just touches z at the boundary, they are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with y such that it partially overlaps with z, neither containing the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, and z is a tangential proper part of y, then x would have to be contained in y (contradicting PO(x,y)).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP - it would force x to be contained in y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely contained in the overlapping region of x and y, and z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then x would be a tangential proper part of y (contradicting PO(x,y)).
