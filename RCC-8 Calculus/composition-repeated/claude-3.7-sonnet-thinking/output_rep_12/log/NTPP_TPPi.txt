PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step-by-step.

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

2. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

So the situation is that x is completely inside y (without touching y's boundary), and z is also completely inside y (while touching y's boundary).

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

- DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected within y.
- EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries.
- PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal.

Now, let's eliminate the ones that aren't possible:

- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) aren't possible because if z is a part of x, and x is a part of y, then z must be completely inside y. But we know that z touches y's boundary, so z cannot be a part of x.

- EQ(x,z) isn't possible because if x equals z, then x should touch y's boundary (since z does). But we know that x doesn't touch y's boundary, so x and z can't be equal.

This leaves us with the following possible relationships: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check these:

- DC(x,z): x and z are completely separate within y. Since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, this is possible.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible.
- TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible.
- NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible.

Wait, let me re-check my elimination of TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, z cannot be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, z cannot be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me check each remaining option carefully:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Given that x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, x and z could indeed be disconnected within y. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. Given the constraints, this is possible. x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and z is inside y touching y's boundary. x and z could touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is also possible. x could share some space with z while not being completely contained in z and vice versa. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and z is inside y touching y's boundary, it's possible for x to be inside z and touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and z is inside y touching y's boundary, it's possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Hmm, something seems odd with my reasoning. Let me rethink this.

We know:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let's now list all the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, x could be one spot inside y, and z could be another spot inside y, and they don't overlap. DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, x and z could touch at their boundaries while being inside y. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share some parts while each having parts the other doesn't have. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and z is inside y touching y's boundary, it's possible for x to be inside z and touch z's boundary. TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given the constraints, this is also possible. NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, z cannot be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, z cannot be inside x at all. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? If they were, then both would either touch y's boundary or not. Since one does and the other doesn't, they can't be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider TPP(x,z). TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that x doesn't touch y's boundary, can x touch z's boundary? Yes, because z's boundary includes not just the part that touches y's boundary but also parts inside y. So x can touch z's boundary without touching y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is still possible.

Let's check if there are any other constraints we missed.

The key constraints are:
- x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Based on these, we've determined that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's double-check these once more:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected within y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z can be externally connected.
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z.

I believe these are all the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints. The impossible relationships are TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to be more careful with EC(x, z). EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. 

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. 

TPPi(y,z) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary. 

So z is inside y and touches y's boundary. x is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

Can x and z touch at a boundary? If they did, then x would have a boundary that touches z. But x is strictly inside y, and z touches y's boundary. So x and z can be externally connected. EC(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I'm having doubts about this. Let's think more carefully about the topology. 

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely inside y, and there's a "buffer zone" between x's boundary and y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So, z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't. But can x touch z's boundary?

Let's think of it like this: z is inside y and touches y's boundary at some point. x is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary. Can x touch z's boundary?

Yes, x can touch z's boundary. Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary, and x as an even smaller circle inside y that doesn't touch y's boundary. x can still touch z's boundary even though it doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, EC(x,z) is still possible.

Let's say we have a circle y, and inside y there's another circle z that touches the boundary of y, and inside y there's also another circle x that doesn't touch the boundary of y. Can x and z be externally connected? That is, can they touch at a point without overlapping?

Yes, x and z can be externally connected. The circle x can touch the circle z at a point without overlapping, while still being completely inside y and not touching y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's try drawing out a few more scenarios to be sure:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary, and x as another small circle inside y that doesn't touch y's boundary and doesn't overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary, and x as another small circle inside y that doesn't touch y's boundary but touches z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary, and x as another small circle inside y that doesn't touch y's boundary but partially overlaps with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary, and x as an even smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary but doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary, and x as an even smaller circle completely inside z that doesn't touch z's boundary or y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm overlooking something. Let's check TPP(x,z) again.

TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But NTPP(x,y) means that x doesn't touch y's boundary. If x touches z's boundary at a point where z touches y's boundary, then x would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So, x can only touch z's boundary at points where z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Is this possible? Yes. Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at a single point, and x as an even smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point opposite to where z touches y's boundary. In this scenario, x touches z's boundary but doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is still possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually I just realized I'm thinking about this wrong, or at least being very imprecise. Let's be more careful about the meaning of the relations.

In RCC-8, "boundary" refers to the boundary of the spatial region, not just the boundary between two specific regions. So NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely inside y, with no part of x touching the boundary of y. TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y) means that z is inside y and touches the boundary of y. 

Given these, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are completely disconnected. Given that both are inside y, this is possible. DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Given the constraints, this is possible. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Given the constraints, this is possible. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Given that x doesn't touch the boundary of y, this is possible as long as x doesn't touch the boundary of z at a point where z touches the boundary of y. TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. Given the constraints, this is possible. NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But since z touches the boundary of y and x doesn't, z cannot be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. But since z touches the boundary of y and x doesn't, z cannot be inside x at all. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If they were, then both would either touch the boundary of y or not. Since one does and the other doesn't, they can't be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) once more. TPP(x,z) means that x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Given that z touches the boundary of y and x doesn't, can x touch the boundary of z?

Yes, x can touch the boundary of z as long as it doesn't touch the boundary of y. Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches the boundary of y at a single point, and x as an even smaller circle inside z that touches the boundary of z at a point opposite to where z touches the boundary of y. In this scenario, x touches the boundary of z but doesn't touch the boundary of y. So TPP(x,z) is still possible.

Actually, let me rethink my whole approach again. Imagine y as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches the boundary of y, and x as another circle inside y that doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are completely disconnected. This means x and z don't share any points. Imagine x as a small circle inside y that doesn't overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. Imagine x as a small circle inside y that touches z at a single point. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means x and z share some points, but each also has points the other doesn't have. Imagine x as a circle inside y that partially overlaps with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Imagine x as a smaller circle inside z that touches the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. Imagine x as a smaller circle completely inside z that doesn't touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that z touches the boundary of y, which x doesn't touch. If z is inside x, then z can't touch the boundary of y (which is outside x). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. But we know that z touches the boundary of y, which is outside x. If z is inside x, then z can't touch the boundary of y. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means x and z occupy exactly the same space. But we know that z touches the boundary of y and x doesn't. So x and z can't occupy the same space. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, let me recheck my reasoning for TPPi(x, z), since I'm not 100% convinced. 

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that z touches the boundary of y, which x doesn't touch. If z is inside x, then z can't touch the boundary of y (which is outside x). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let's be more precise. TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means that z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that z touches the boundary of y, and x doesn't touch the boundary of y. This seems like a contradiction. Let's double-check.

If z is inside x, then all of z is inside x. Since z touches the boundary of y, and all of z is inside x, then x must also touch the boundary of y. But we know that x doesn't touch the boundary of y. So z can't be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

OK, let's quickly double-check these once more:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be completely disconnected inside y. Possible.
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries. Possible.
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap. Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): x can be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z. Possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a proper part of z without touching the boundary of z. Possible.

The final answer is DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to analyze what each relation means and identify the possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

Possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be completely disconnected regions within y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap, each having parts the other doesn't have.

4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z (inside z and touching z's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z (completely inside z without touching z's boundary).

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- If z were part of x, then z couldn't touch y's boundary (which it does)
- If x and z were equal, they would have the same relationship with y's boundary

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
