PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider the constraints we have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z. In RCC-8, the possible relationships are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Let's think through each possibility systematically:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is certainly possible. For example, imagine x and z as two disconnected regions, and y as a region that touches both at their boundaries, but x and z themselves don't touch.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary. This is also possible. Imagine x, y, and z as three regions arranged in a line, where each touches its neighbor at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Imagine y as a region that touches both x and z at their boundaries, and x and z overlap in some region.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. Imagine x as a small region, z as a larger region containing x, and y as a region that touches both x and z at their boundaries.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. I think this is not possible. If x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x at its boundary, then y would have to intersect with the interior of z, which would contradict EC(y,z).

Let me think about this more carefully. If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely contained in the interior of z. If EC(x,y), then y touches x at its boundary. But if x's boundary is entirely within the interior of z, then y must penetrate into the interior of z to touch x, which means y and z cannot be externally connected (EC). So NTPP(x,z) is not compatible with the given constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. By the same logic as in point 4, this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. By the same logic as in point 5, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. Is this possible? If x and z are identical, and both EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then it would mean EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). In RCC-8, the EC relation is symmetric, so EC(x,y) implies EC(y,x). But this doesn't tell us whether x and z can be identical. Let's think about it geometrically. If x and z are identical, and both touch y at their boundaries, then y would touch the same region (x/z) at its boundary. This seems possible.

But wait, let's double-check. If x and z are identical, and EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then we have EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). But EC(y,x) is just EC(x,y) since EC is symmetric. So we're not adding any new information. So yes, EQ(x,z) is compatible with the given constraints.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me re-examine the case of NTPP(x,z). I claimed that if x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and EC(x,y), then y would have to intersect with the interior of z, which would contradict EC(y,z). 

Let's visualize this. If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x. If y touches x's boundary, and x is completely inside z, then y must reach inside z to touch x. But this means y and z cannot be externally connected (EC); they would have to partially overlap (PO) at least. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not compatible with the constraints.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) (which means NTPP(z,x)), z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. If y touches z's boundary, and z is completely inside x, then y must reach inside x to touch z. But if y reaches inside x, and EC(x,y), then y must also touch x's boundary. This creates a contradiction because y can't both reach inside x (to touch z) and only touch x at its boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not compatible with the constraints.

Let me check the case of TPP(x,z) again. If TPP(x,z), then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x. If y touches x's boundary where x touches z's boundary, then y also touches z's boundary, which is consistent with EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z) (which means TPP(z,x)), z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. If y touches z's boundary where z touches x's boundary, then y also touches x's boundary, which is consistent with EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let's also check the case of EQ(x,z) again. If x and z are identical, and EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then we have EC(x,y) and EC(y,x). But this is just restating the same relationship because EC is symmetric. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I need to be more careful about some of these cases. Let me re-examine.

For TPP(x,z), we have x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x. Now, if y touches x's boundary at a point where x does not touch z's boundary, then y would have to penetrate into the interior of z to reach x, which would contradict EC(y,z). So y can only touch x at points where x touches z's boundary. But is this possible? Yes, it's possible. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary at one point, and y as a region outside z that touches both x and z at that one point.

For TPPi(x,z), we have z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. Now, if y touches z's boundary at a point where z does not touch x's boundary, then y would have to penetrate into the interior of x to reach z, which would contradict EC(x,y). So y can only touch z at points where z touches x's boundary. This is possible by the same logic as for TPP(x,z).

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are identical, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are the same statement, which is consistent.

So I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Let's double-check the case of PO(x,z).

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap. If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x. If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. If y touches both x and z at their boundaries, and x and z overlap, then y would have to touch the boundaries of x and z at points outside their overlap. This is possible. Imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, and y as a region that touches both x and z at their boundaries outside their overlap.

So PO(x,z) is possible, and the list of possible relationships between x and z remains: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

In conclusion, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z in RCC-8 are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Hmm, now I realize I'm second-guessing myself too much. Let me think more carefully about whether NTPPi and NTPP are truly impossible.

For NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x. But if x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y must penetrate into the interior of z to reach x. This contradicts EC(y,z), which requires y to only touch z at its boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z), which is the same as NTPP(z,x), z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. But if z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y must penetrate into the interior of x to reach z. This contradicts EC(x,y), which requires y to only touch x at its boundary.

So, both NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me double-check TPP, TPPi, and EQ again as well.

For TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary. For this to be compatible with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch x's boundary where it coincides with z's boundary. This is possible.

For TPPi(x,z), which is the same as TPP(z,x), z is inside x and touches x's boundary. For this to be compatible with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch z's boundary where it coincides with x's boundary. This is possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are identical. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then we're saying EC(x,y) and EC(y,x), which is the same relationship stated twice (since EC is symmetric). So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, my final list of possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait, there's a problem with the EQ case. If x and z are identical, then we would have EC(x,y) and EC(z,y), which is just restating the same relationship. But we're given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), which is EC(x,y) and EC(y,x) if x and z are identical. So we would have both EC(x,y) and EC(y,x), which is fine because EC is symmetric. So EQ(x,z) is indeed possible.

In conclusion, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z in RCC-8 are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Hmm, actually, I think I should think more carefully again about the cases of TPP and TPPi. 

Let's say TPP(x,z). Then x is a tangential proper part of z. Let's say that part of the boundary of x (call it x_boundary) coincides with part of the boundary of z (call it z_boundary), and the rest of x is properly contained in z.

Now, if EC(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x, but not its interior. There are two possibilities: either y touches x at a part of the boundary that coincides with the boundary of z, or y touches x at a part of the boundary that is inside z.

If y touches x at a part of the boundary that coincides with the boundary of z, then y also touches the boundary of z. Since y doesn't overlap with x (because EC(x,y)), and x is a proper part of z, y doesn't overlap with z either. So EC(y,z) holds.

But if y touches x at a part of the boundary that is inside z, then y would have to penetrate into the interior of z to reach this part. This would contradict EC(y,z), which requires y to only touch the boundary of z, not its interior.

So, for TPP(x,z) to be possible, y can only touch x at parts of its boundary that coincide with the boundary of z. Is this possible? Yes, it is. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary at one point, and y as a region outside z that touches both x and z at that one point.

Now, let's consider TPPi(x,z), which means TPP(z,x). Then z is a tangential proper part of x. By the same logic as above, for this to be compatible with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch z's boundary where it coincides with x's boundary. This is possible.

So, both TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) are possible given the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually wait, maybe I don't have the right understanding of EC. Let me double-check. The "Externally Connected" relationship EC(x,y) means that the topological closures of x and y intersect, but their interiors do not. In other words, x and y touch at their boundaries.

Based on this understanding, let's re-analyze the case of TPP(x,z).

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is properly contained in z and x touches the boundary of z. If EC(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x but doesn't overlap with x. If EC(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z but doesn't overlap with z.

Now, if y touches the boundary of x, and x is properly contained in z, then y must reach inside z to touch x. But this would mean y overlaps with z, contradicting EC(y,z). The only way this could work is if y touches x at a point where x also touches the boundary of z. In this case, y would also touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with EC(y,z).

Actually, this is exactly the case I described before. So TPP(x,z) is possible, but with the constraint that y can only touch x at points where x touches the boundary of z.

Let's consider TPPi(x,z), which means TPP(z,x). Then z is a tangential proper part of x. If EC(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z but doesn't overlap with z. If EC(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x but doesn't overlap with x.

Now, if y touches the boundary of z, and z is properly contained in x, then y must reach inside x to touch z. But this would mean y overlaps with x, contradicting EC(x,y). The only way this could work is if y touches z at a point where z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, y would also touch the boundary of x, which is consistent with EC(x,y).

So TPPi(x,z) is possible, but with the constraint that y can only touch z at points where z touches the boundary of x.

In conclusion, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z in RCC-8 are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I want to reconsider the case of EQ(x,z) more carefully.

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are identical. Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), we would have EC(x,y) and EC(y,x) if x and z are identical. But EC is symmetric, so EC(y,x) is the same as EC(x,y). So we're not adding any new constraints. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So my final list of possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Let me verify once more. There are 8 possible RCC-8 relations, and we've ruled out NTPP and NTPPi. So the remaining 6 are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

I believe this is the correct answer.

In summary, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z in RCC-8 are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which of the 8 RCC-8 relations could possibly hold between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each potential relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Imagine x and z as separate regions that don't touch, with y touching both x and z at their boundaries.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. Picture x, y, and z arranged so that each touches its neighbors at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap while both externally connect with y at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible, but only if y touches x at a point where x's boundary coincides with z's boundary. Otherwise, y would have to penetrate z's interior to reach x.

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y must penetrate z's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, with similar constraints as TPP - y must touch z at a point where z's boundary coincides with x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. By the same reasoning as NTPP, this would require y to penetrate x's interior.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. If x and z are identical, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) describe the same relationship.
