{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), then what is the relationship between x and z?\n\nSince EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (exactly the same region), x must have exactly the same relationship with z that y has with z.\n\nGiven that y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way.\n\n### Answer: PO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 6.543950080871582, "reasoning-tokens": 415, "completion-tokens": 415}
