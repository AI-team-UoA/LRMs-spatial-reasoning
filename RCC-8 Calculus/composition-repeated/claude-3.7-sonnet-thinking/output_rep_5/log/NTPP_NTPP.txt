PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We are asked to determine the possible relations between x and z, given that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's recall the definition of NTPP(x,y):
NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. That is, x is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now we have:
NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, x is strictly contained within y (without touching y's boundary), and y is strictly contained within z (without touching z's boundary). The question is: what is the relationship between x and z?

Intuitively, if x is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside z, then x must be strictly inside z. In other words, x should be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

To verify this, let's think through the other RCC-8 relations and see if any of them could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. This can't be the case if x is inside y and y is inside z.
2. EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This can't be the case either since x is strictly inside y, which is strictly inside z, so x can't reach the boundary of z.
3. PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. Again, this can't be the case because x is completely inside y, which is completely inside z.
4. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x touches the boundary of z. But since x is strictly inside y and y is strictly inside z, x can't touch the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is plausible.
6. TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This can't be the case because y is strictly inside z, and x is strictly inside y, so z can't be a part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This can't be the case for the same reason as above.
8. EQ(x,z) means x and z are coincident. This can't be the case because if x = z, then y would have to be both strictly inside x and strictly contain x, which is a contradiction.

From this analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check using transitivity properties of RCC-8 relations.

The RCC-8 calculus has a composition table that specifies which relations can hold between regions x and z when we know the relations between x and y, and between y and z.

For NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the composition would give us the possible relations between x and z.

Let's try to reason through this systematically.

If NTPP(x,y), then x is strictly inside y without touching y's boundary.
If NTPP(y,z), then y is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary.

If we combine these two facts, it means that x is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside z, so x must be strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. This corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

Since I don't have the precise RCC-8 composition table with me, I'll derive this result from the definitions and the given constraints:

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is entirely contained in y and x is not equal to y).
- x does not touch the boundary of y.

NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is entirely contained in z and y is not equal to z).
- y does not touch the boundary of z.

From these, we can infer:
- x is entirely contained in y, and y is entirely contained in z, so x must be entirely contained in z. This rules out DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
- x does not touch the boundary of y, and y does not touch the boundary of z. So x is separated from the boundary of z by at least the distance between y's boundary and z's boundary. This means x cannot touch the boundary of z, ruling out TPP.
- x is not equal to z because x is strictly inside y, which is strictly inside z. This rules out EQ.

So, by elimination, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I can also argue it directly:
- x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x is a proper part of z (transitivity of "proper part").
- x is not touching the boundary of y, and y is not touching the boundary of z. So, x is strictly inside y, which is strictly inside z, meaning x cannot touch the boundary of z. This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

So, based on the given constraints NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me confirm once more: x is strictly inside y, which is strictly inside z. Thus, x is deeply inside z, away from its boundary. This is the very definition of NTPP, so NTPP(x,z) is our answer.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships can exist between x and z based on the given conditions.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is fully inside y without touching y's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is fully inside z without touching z's boundary)

Analysis:
If x is fully inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is fully inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must be fully inside z without touching z's boundary.

This is because:
- x is completely contained within y
- y is completely contained within z
- Therefore, x is completely contained within z
- x cannot possibly reach the boundary of z, since it doesn't even reach the boundary of y, and y doesn't reach the boundary of z

This relationship describes exactly the NTPP relation.
