PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let's break down what these relations mean:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y). In other words, z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is properly contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine what relationship can hold between x and z. Let me think about the possible scenarios:

1. Since x is a tangential proper part of y (touches y's boundary), and z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary, it's possible that x and z are completely disconnected. This would be DC(x,z).

2. It's also possible that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. This would be EC(x,z).

3. It's possible that x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being contained in the other. This would be PO(x,z).

4. It's possible that z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. This would be TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x).

5. It's possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary. This would be NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x).

6. It's possible that x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. This would be TPP(x,z).

7. It's possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is properly contained within z without touching z's boundary. This would be NTPP(x,z).

8. It's possible that x and z are equal, sharing exactly the same space. This would be EQ(x,z).

Let me analyze which of these possibilities can actually occur given the constraints.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

I'm going to consider each RCC-8 relation and determine if it's possible between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Since both x and z are parts of y, they both share space with y. It's possible for x and z to be completely disconnected within y. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, there can be scenarios where x and z touch at a boundary within y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): It's possible for x and z to partially overlap within y, with neither being contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be a tangential proper part of z. Since z is properly contained within y, and x touches y's boundary, for x to be a part of z, z would have to extend to y's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the constraint NTPPi(y,z).

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is properly contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, let's reconsider:

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be a tangential proper part of z. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be entirely contained within z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be a non-tangential proper part of z. But again, since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be entirely contained within z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): For this to be true, z would need to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): For this to be true, z would need to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary. Given that z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would need to occupy the same space. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, they can't be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I'm not sure if my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) is correct. Let me reconsider.

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be contained in x and touch x's boundary.

Given that x is a tangential proper part of y and z is a non-tangential proper part of y, is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x?

If x is a tangential proper part of y, then x is contained in y and touches y's boundary. If z is a non-tangential proper part of y, then z is contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, for z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be contained in x (which is already contained in y), and z must touch x's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, the only way for z to touch x's boundary is at a point of x that's not on y's boundary. This is possible.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y and x is a tangential proper part of y, it's possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again, Let me reason more carefully. Let's reason through the constraints and the possible relationships:

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y). So, NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since both x and z are inside y, this is possible only if they don't overlap. Given that x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, it's possible for them to be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. Given that x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, if z is positioned such that it touches x's boundary (which is not on y's boundary), then EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, with neither being entirely contained in the other. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x must be inside z and touch z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x must be inside z and not touch z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be entirely inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be inside x and touch x's boundary. Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary, it's possible for z to be inside x and touch a part of x's boundary that's not on y's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be inside x and not touch x's boundary. Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary, it's possible for z to be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, they can't be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But actually, I'm still concerned that my reasoning about TPPi and NTPPi might be flawed. Let me try to think more visually.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, to think about TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x):
This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be inside x and touch x's boundary.

If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then z can indeed be inside x and touch a part of x's boundary that's not on y's boundary. This is because x has a boundary that's not part of y's boundary (it's internal to y). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x):
This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be inside x and not touch x's boundary.

If x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then z can be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Hmm, this still feels a bit abstract. Let me give a concrete example: Imagine y as a circle, x as a smaller circle inside y and touching y's boundary, and z as an even smaller circle inside y and not touching y's boundary. Now, depending on the position of z within y, we can have different relationships with x:

- If z is completely outside of x, then DC(x,z).
- If z touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x, then EC(x,z).
- If z partially overlaps with x, then PO(x,z).
- If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x).
- If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x).

So, based on this, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me just sanity check with a more rigorous approach using the composition table for RCC-8 relations. 

Actually, I realize I might be making an error in how I'm reading NTPPi(y,z). Let me clarify:

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

I think I was right before. Let me just be extra sure by thinking through this carefully. We have:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y). So, it means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Based on the RCC-8 composition table, when we compose TPP(x,y) with NTPPi(y,z), we get the possible relationships between x and z. Let me think about this:

TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(z,y) means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

Since both x and z are inside y, and given their boundary constraints, the possible relationships are:
- DC(x,z): x and z don't overlap.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

So the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me verify this against the RCC-8 composition table once more:

The composition of TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) is indeed:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait I think I'm wrong in my understanding of NTPPi(y,z). Let me be precise in my understanding:

NTPPi stands for "Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse."

Given NTPPi(y,z), we're saying that the relation between y and z is the inverse of the NTPP relation. Specifically, it means NTPP(z,y).

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which is what I was using.

Now, let's reconsider the composition of TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z):

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to find the possible relationships between x and z based on these conditions.

Let's think of specific scenarios:

1. x and z are completely disjoint within y. This is DC(x,z).
2. x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This is EC(x,z).
3. x and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other. This is PO(x,z).
4. z is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x).
5. z is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x).

Are there any other possibilities?

- Can x be properly contained within z and touch z's boundary? For this to be true, x would need to be inside z and touch z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x cannot be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

- Can x be properly contained within z and not touch z's boundary? For the same reason as above, this is not possible. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

- Can x and z be equal? Since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, they can't be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on this, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm confident that these are the correct possibilities.

Actually, I thought of a simple counterexample that might show I'm wrong about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) being possible.

Imagine y as a large circle, x as a small circle that's tangential to y (i.e., x touches y's boundary at one point), and z as a small circle inside y that doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, if z is on the opposite side of y from x, then z cannot be contained within x. This means that TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not always possible.

So, the possibilities are:
- DC(x,z): x and z don't overlap, such as when z is far from x within y.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is positioned right.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also possible if z is positioned right.

I need to be more careful. It seems like I'm still having trouble understanding whether TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible. Let me reason more carefully.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to consider whether z can be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)).

Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary, z can be inside x only if x is positioned in a way that encompasses z. If x is a small circle tangential to y, and z is a small circle inside y and not touching y's boundary, it's possible for z to be inside x if z is close to the point where x touches y.

But, if z is on the opposite side of y from where x touches y, then z cannot be inside x. In this case, z and x would be disconnected (DC(x,z)).

So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not always guaranteed, but they are possible depending on the positioning.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I believe my analysis is correct now.

Hmm, I'm still a bit unsure, and it feels like this might be a problem where I can leverage the RCC-8 composition table directly. Let me check if I can recall it.

The composition of TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I think this is correct. If we have TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then x and z can be related in any of the five ways I've listed.

So the answer is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Since x touches y's boundary but z doesn't, x cannot be contained within z (so TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible). Similarly, since their boundary relationships with y differ, x and z cannot be equal.

However, the following relationships are possible:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected regions within y
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap
4. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x
5. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
