PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step. We know two relationships:
1. DC(x,y) - x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
2. EQ(y,z) - y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Given that y and z occupy exactly the same space (they're equal), any relationship that x has with y must be the same relationship that x has with z.

Since we know that x and y are disconnected (DC), and z is coincident with y, then x and z must also be disconnected.

So, the relationship between x and z must be:
DC(x,z)

There are no other possibilities because EQ(y,z) means y and z are exactly the same spatial region.

To double-check this logic:
- If x is disconnected from y (shares no points with y)
- And y is exactly the same as z (shares all points with z)
- Then x must be disconnected from z (shares no points with z)

So the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same spatial region, any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if x is disconnected from y, and z is equivalent to y, then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
