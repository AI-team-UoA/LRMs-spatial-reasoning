PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same region)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary

I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical in terms of spatial extent. They occupy exactly the same space.
Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is identical to y (due to EQ(x,y)), and y is completely contained within z without touching its boundary (due to NTPP(y,z)), it follows that x must also be completely contained within z without touching its boundary.

In the RCC-8 calculus, this relationship is exactly the definition of NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- If x = y (from EQ(x,y)) and y is a proper part of z without touching its boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be a proper part of z without touching its boundary.
- This corresponds exactly to the NTPP relation.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me consider this more carefully. The question is asking for the possible relationships between x and z. But in this case, there is only one possible relationship, which is NTPP(x,z).

Let's verify by considering the definitions of all RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z) would mean x and z are disconnected. This cannot be true because x equals y, and y is inside z.
- EC(x,z) would mean x and z touch at a boundary. This cannot be true because y (which is the same as x) does not touch z's boundary.
- PO(x,z) would mean x and z partially overlap. This cannot be true because x (which is the same as y) is entirely inside z.
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z (touches z's boundary). This cannot be true because y (which is the same as x) does not touch z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is true because x equals y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This cannot be true because z contains y (which equals x), not the other way around.
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This cannot be true because z contains y (which equals x), not the other way around.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same. This cannot be true because y (which equals x) is a proper part of z, not equal to z.

So indeed, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relation holds between x and z given the information provided.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (identical regions)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), x must have exactly the same spatial relationship with z as y does. 

Since y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), and x is identical to y, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
