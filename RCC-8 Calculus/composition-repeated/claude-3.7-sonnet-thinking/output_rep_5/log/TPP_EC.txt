PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's go through this step by step:

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z externally connect. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Given these two conditions, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

I need to consider all possibilities systematically:

- DC (Disconnected): x and z don't share any points
- EC (Externally Connected): x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO (Partially Overlapping): x and z partially overlap
- TPP (Tangential Proper Part): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- NTPP (Non-Tangential Proper Part): x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary
- TPPi (Inverse Tangential Proper Part): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- NTPPi (Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part): z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary
- EQ (Equal): x and z are identical

Let's analyze each:

1. DC(x,z): Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y does not touch z, then x and z would be disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Since TPP(x,y), x touches y's boundary. Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If x touches y's boundary exactly at a point where y touches z, then x and z would be externally connected. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share some interior points. Since TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), and EC means no interior points are shared, it's not possible for x and z to share interior points unless x extends beyond y's boundary, which contradicts TPP(x,y). So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), x is inside y and y touches z at the boundary. But for x to be inside z, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reasons.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. For z to be inside x, x would need to extend beyond y, which contradicts TPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is even less possible than TPPi(x,z) for the same reasons.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the same space. Since TPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y, and since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. This contradiction means EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning. 

For DC(x,z):
TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
If x touches y's boundary at a point where y does not touch z, then x and z would be disconnected. This is possible.

For EC(x,z):
If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z, then x and z would be externally connected. This is possible.

Let me analyze these cases more carefully:

Given TPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary at some points.
Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

For DC(x,z):
If x touches y's boundary at points where y does not touch z, and x doesn't touch y's boundary at any point where y touches z, then x and z would be disconnected. This is possible.

For EC(x,z):
If x touches y's boundary at least at one point where y touches z, then x and z would touch at that point, making them externally connected. This is possible.

For PO(x,z):
For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share some interior points while also having some parts not shared. Since EC(y,z), y and z don't share interior points. Since TPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. This means x cannot share interior points with z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

For TPP(x,z):
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), x is inside y and y touches z only at the boundary. For x to be inside z, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reasons.

For TPPi(x,z):
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Since EC(y,z) and TPP(x,y), z is outside y except at the boundary, and x is inside y. This means z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
This is even less possible than TPPi(x,z) for the same reasons.

For EQ(x,z):
For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the same space. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y, and since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. This means x and z cannot occupy the same space. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

Wait, let me think about this more carefully:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z externally connect, so they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y does not touch z, then x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) is possible.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z, then x and z would touch at that point, making them externally connected, so EC(x,z) is possible.

Are there any other possibilities? Let's double-check by reasoning through some specific cases:

1. Could PO(x,z) be possible? For this, x and z would need to partially overlap. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. So x and z can only interact at y's boundary. They cannot share interior points, which is required for PO. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

2. Could TPP(x,z) be possible? For this, x would need to be a tangential proper part of z. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. For x to be inside z, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

3. Could NTPP(x,z) be possible? For this, x would need to be a non-tangential proper part of z. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reasons.

4. Could TPPi(x,z) be possible? For this, z would need to be a tangential proper part of x. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. For z to be inside x, x would need to extend beyond y, which contradicts TPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

5. Could NTPPi(x,z) be possible? For this, z would need to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is even less possible than TPPi(x,z) for the same reasons.

6. Could EQ(x,z) be possible? For this, x and z would need to be equal. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. So x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Wait, there's actually a third possible relation between x and z: PO(x,z). Let me reconsider:

TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y does not touch z, and x doesn't touch y's boundary at any point where y touches z, then x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z) is possible.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z, and x doesn't extend beyond y, then x and z would touch at that point but not overlap, making them externally connected, so EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z would need to partially overlap, sharing some interior points while also having some parts not shared. Since EC(y,z), y and z don't share interior points. Since TPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. This means x cannot share interior points with z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

Actually, wait a moment. Let me think about this once more, because I'm not sure if I've been reasoning correctly about EC. 

EC means that two regions touch at their boundaries but have no shared interior points. Let's consider the possible configurations:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary at points where y does not touch z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at that point but not overlap.

3. PO(x,z): For this, x and z would need to partially overlap, sharing some interior points. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. For x and z to partially overlap, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For this, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. For x to be inside z, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reasons.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. For z to be inside x, x would need to extend beyond y, which contradicts TPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is even less possible than TPPi(x,z) for the same reasons.

8. EQ(x,z): For this, x and z would need to be equal. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. So x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

Let me actually double-check PO case again.

For PO(x,z), x and z would need to partially overlap, sharing some interior points while also having some parts not shared. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share interior points. But since z is outside y except at the boundary, and x is inside y, they cannot share interior points. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

So I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let's get back to basics and consider some concrete examples, because I'm not sure if I'm visualizing the constraints correctly.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z externally connect, so they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Let's think of some 2D examples:
- Imagine y as a circle, and x as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at one point.
- Imagine z as another circle outside y that touches y's boundary at one point.

Now, there are two main cases to consider:
1. x touches y's boundary at a point where y does not touch z. In this case, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).
2. x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z. In this case, x and z touch at that point but don't overlap, so EC(x,z).

Are there any other possibilities? Let's consider:
- Could x touch z at multiple points? If x touches y's boundary at multiple points, and y touches z at one of those points, then x and z would still be externally connected, so EC(x,z).
- Could x and z overlap? For this, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z).
- Could x be inside z? For this, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z).
- Could z be inside x? For this, x would need to extend beyond y, which contradicts TPP(x,y).

No, I don't see any other possibilities. So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

Let me be absolutely sure by constructing one more concrete example: imagine x, y, and z as 2D regions:
- y is a square
- x is a smaller square inside y that touches y's boundary at one side
- z is a rectangle outside y that touches y's boundary at one side

Case 1: If x touches y's boundary at a side where y does not touch z, then x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).
Case 2: If x touches y's boundary at a side where y touches z, then x and z touch at that side but don't overlap, so EC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, I'm realizing I need to think more carefully. Let's be more precise: TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) and I want to know the possible relationships between x and z.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary at at least one point.

EC(y,z) means y and z externally connect, so they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, here are the possible cases:

1. x touches y's boundary at points where y does not touch z. In this case, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z).

2. x touches y's boundary at at least one point where y touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at that point but not overlap, so EC(x,z).

But here's a subtle point: Can x and z share interior points? Since EC(y,z), y and z don't share interior points. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. So x cannot share interior points with z. This means PO(x,z) is not possible.

And actually, I now realize I've been reasoning correctly. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

Let me try to put this reasoning more clearly and directly.

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. So x is inside y, x ≠ y, and x touches y's boundary at at least one point.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. So y and z have no shared interior points, but they touch at at least one point on their boundaries.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): Possible if x only touches y's boundary at points where y does not touch z. In this case, x and z have no points in common.

2. EC(x,z): Possible if x touches y's boundary at at least one point where y touches z. In this case, x and z touch at at least one point but have no shared interior points.

3. PO(x,z): For this, x and z would need to partially overlap, sharing some interior points. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. So x cannot share interior points with z. This means PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For this, x would need to be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. For x to be inside z, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this, x would need to be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. For x to be inside z, z would need to extend into y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this, z would need to be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. For z to be inside x, x would need to extend beyond y, which contradicts TPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For this, z would need to be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. For z to be inside x, x would need to extend beyond y, which contradicts TPP(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For this, x and z would need to be equal. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y. Since EC(y,z), z is outside y except at the boundary. So x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

But that actually make sense, and is a well-known result in RCC8. The composition of TPP and EC can be DC or EC.

So, my final answer is that given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let me break down what we know:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary at some point.
- EC(y,z) means y and z externally connect. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, I'll consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch z. In this case, x and z have no common points.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary at at least one point where y touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at that boundary point but wouldn't overlap.

3. Other relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ): None of these are possible because:
   - For PO, TPP, or NTPP: z would need to extend into y, contradicting EC(y,z)
   - For TPPi or NTPPi: x would need to extend beyond y, contradicting TPP(x,y)
   - For EQ: x is inside y while z is outside y (except at boundary points)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
