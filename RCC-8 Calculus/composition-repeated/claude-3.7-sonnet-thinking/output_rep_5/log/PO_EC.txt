PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm asked to determine the possible relationships between `x` and `z` given that `PO(x,y)` and `EC(y,z)`.

Let's analyze what we know:
- `PO(x,y)`: x and y partially overlap. They share some common parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- `EC(y,z)`: y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z. I'll go through the eight RCC-8 relations:

1. `DC(x,z)`: x and z are disconnected.
2. `EC(x,z)`: x and z touch at a boundary.
3. `PO(x,z)`: x and z partially overlap.
4. `TPP(x,z)`: x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. `NTPP(x,z)`: x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. `TPPi(x,z)` or `TPP(z,x)`: z is a tangential proper part of x.
7. `NTPPi(x,z)` or `NTPP(z,x)`: z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. `EQ(x,z)`: x and z are equal.

Let's reason about each possibility:

1. `DC(x,z)`: Since y touches z (EC), and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x doesn't intersect with z at all. This is a valid possibility.

2. `EC(x,z)`: Since y touches z, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x touches z exactly at the boundary. This is a valid possibility.

3. `PO(x,z)`: It's possible that x and z share some interior points but neither is contained in the other. This is a valid possibility.

4. `TPP(x,z)`: This means x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y and y only touches z at the boundary, it seems difficult for x to be entirely contained in z. But I need to think more carefully about this.

If x is mostly in the part of y that doesn't touch z, with a small part of x extending to the boundary where y and z touch, then potentially x could be a tangential proper part of z. But this would require z to extend beyond y in a way that completely encompasses x, which doesn't contradict our constraints. So `TPP(x,z)` is a possibility.

5. `NTPP(x,z)`: This means x is entirely contained in z's interior without touching z's boundary. Given that y only touches z at the boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible for x to be entirely in the interior of z. This is a valid possibility.

6. `TPPi(x,z)` or `TPP(z,x)`: This means z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since y and z only touch at their boundaries, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x. This is a valid possibility.

7. `NTPPi(x,z)` or `NTPP(z,x)`: This means z is entirely contained in x's interior without touching x's boundary. Since y and z touch at their boundaries, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is a valid possibility.

8. `EQ(x,z)`: This means x and z are identical. Since y partially overlaps with x and y externally connects with z, x and z cannot be the same region. So this is not a valid possibility.

Wait, I need to reconsider my reasoning for possibilities 4, 5, 6, and 7. 

For `TPP(x,z)`, if x is entirely contained in z, then some part of x overlaps with y. Since y only touches z at the boundary, the part of x that overlaps with y must be at z's boundary. This means x touches z's boundary, which is consistent with `TPP(x,z)`. So `TPP(x,z)` is a possibility.

For `NTPP(x,z)`, if x is entirely in z's interior without touching z's boundary, then x cannot overlap with the part of y that touches z (since that part is at z's boundary). This contradicts the fact that x partially overlaps with y. So `NTPP(x,z)` is not a possibility.

For `TPPi(x,z)` or `TPP(z,x)`, if z is entirely contained in x, then z touches x's boundary. Since z touches y at the boundary, and y partially overlaps with x, it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x. So `TPPi(x,z)` is a possibility.

For `NTPPi(x,z)` or `NTPP(z,x)`, if z is entirely in x's interior without touching x's boundary, then z cannot touch y at the boundary (because that would mean z also touches x's boundary). This contradicts the fact that z externally connects with y. So `NTPPi(x,z)` is not a possibility.

Actually, I need to think more carefully about these spatial relations. Let me try visualizing the scenarios.

1. `DC(x,z)`: Imagine y as a mediator that touches z at a boundary but doesn't overlap with it. x overlaps with y, but in a part of y that doesn't touch z. In this case, x and z are disconnected.

2. `EC(x,z)`: Imagine y touching z at a boundary. x overlaps with y in a way that extends to the boundary where y and z meet. In this case, x and z externally connect.

3. `PO(x,z)`: Imagine y touching z at a boundary. x overlaps with y and also extends into z. In this case, x and z partially overlap.

4. `TPP(x,z)`: I need to reconsider this. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y and z externally connect, then it's possible for x to overlap with y where y and z meet, making x a tangential proper part of z.

5. `NTPP(x,z)`: If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means x is entirely in z's interior without touching z's boundary. But then how can x overlap with y, which only touches z at the boundary? It can't. So `NTPP(x,z)` is not a possibility.

6. `TPPi(x,z)` or `TPP(z,x)`: If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. Given that y externally connects with z and partially overlaps with x, this is a possible configuration.

7. `NTPPi(x,z)` or `NTPP(z,x)`: If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely within x's interior. But then how can z externally connect with y, which partially overlaps with x? It would mean z touches y at a boundary, which means z must also touch x's boundary (since y partially overlaps with x). But this contradicts z being a non-tangential proper part of x. So `NTPPi(x,z)` is not a possibility.

8. `EQ(x,z)`: If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. But y partially overlaps with x and externally connects with z. These are contradictory requirements. So `EQ(x,z)` is not a possibility.

Let me reconsider the case of `TPP(x,z)`. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y partially overlaps with x, then some part of y is inside x (and hence inside z). But y and z externally connect, which means they only touch at the boundary and don't share interior points. This contradicts the fact that some part of y is inside z. So `TPP(x,z)` is not a possibility.

Actually, I need to be even more careful.

For `TPP(x,z)`, if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Since y partially overlaps with x, some part of y is inside x (and hence inside z), and some part of y is outside x. But y and z externally connect, which means they only touch at the boundary and don't share interior points. This contradicts the fact that some part of y is inside z. So `TPP(x,z)` is not a possibility.

Actually, no, that's not quite right. Let me draw this out more explicitly.

1. PO(x,y) means that x and y overlap in some parts but not others. Let's call the overlapping part "xy".
2. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

Now, for TPP(x,z), x would be entirely within z and touch z's boundary. If the overlapping part "xy" is at the boundary where y and z meet, then it's possible for x to be entirely within z, touch z's boundary (via the overlapping part "xy"), and still satisfy PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be entirely within z's interior without touching z's boundary. But then the overlapping part "xy" would be in z's interior, which contradicts EC(y,z) which says y and z only touch at the boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be entirely within x and touch x's boundary. Since y partially overlaps with x and externally connects with z, it's possible for z to be entirely within x, touch x's boundary (via the part where y and z meet), and still satisfy PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be entirely within x's interior without touching x's boundary. But since z externally connects with y, and y partially overlaps with x, z must touch the boundary of x (via the part where y and z meet). This contradicts NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double-check TPP(x,z) again:
TPP(x,z) means x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. But since y partially overlaps with x, some part of y (the overlapping part "xy") is inside x, which means it's inside z. But EC(y,z) says y and z only touch at the boundary and don't share interior points. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, I think I made an error. Let me redraw this differently:

Imagine y and z as two regions that touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)). Now, imagine x as a region that partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), meaning some of x is inside y and some is outside y.

For TPP(x,z), x would need to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. If x is positioned in a way that it overlaps with y on the side opposite to where y and z touch, then some of x is inside y (satisfying PO(x,y)), and none of x is touching z's boundary, which contradicts TPP(x,z). On the other hand, if x is positioned in a way that it overlaps with y near where y and z touch, then the part of x that's inside y might also be touching z's boundary. But the part of x that's outside y would either be touching z's boundary (which is OK) or be outside z (which contradicts TPP(x,z)). So, it's not clear if TPP(x,z) is possible. Let me think more about this.

Let's simplify this. For TPP(x,z) to be true:
- x is entirely inside z.
- x touches z's boundary.

For PO(x,y) to be true:
- Some of x is inside y.
- Some of x is outside y.

For EC(y,z) to be true:
- y and z touch at their boundaries.
- y and z don't share interior points.

Now, if x is entirely inside z and y doesn't share interior points with z, then x can't be inside y (because then some of y would be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z)). But for PO(x,y) to be true, some of x must be inside y. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Hmm, wait. Actually, for PO(x,y), it doesn't mean "some of x is inside y," but rather "x and y share some common parts, but neither is entirely contained in the other." So, if the boundary of x touches the boundary of y, and they share some interior points, that's still considered PO(x,y).

For TPP(x,z) and EC(y,z), if z doesn't share interior points with y, and x is entirely inside z, then x can't share interior points with y. But for PO(x,y), x and y need to share interior points. This is still a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me make one more check.

For PO(x,y) to be true:
- x and y must overlap in their interiors.
- Some of x is outside y.
- Some of y is outside x.

For EC(y,z) to be true:
- y and z touch at their boundaries.
- y and z don't share interior points.

For TPP(x,z) to be true:
- x is entirely inside z.
- x touches z's boundary.

If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, and y doesn't share interior points with z but touches z at its boundary, then the only way x can overlap with y in their interiors is if x touches the boundary of y at the same place where y touches the boundary of z. But this would mean x only touches y at the boundary, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me revisit TPPi(x,z) (which is TPP(z,x)):

For TPPi(x,z) to be true:
- z is entirely inside x.
- z touches x's boundary.

For PO(x,y) to be true:
- x and y overlap in their interiors.
- Some of x is outside y.
- Some of y is outside x.

For EC(y,z) to be true:
- y and z touch at their boundaries.
- y and z don't share interior points.

If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at their boundaries, then y must also touch x at the boundary. But for PO(x,y), x and y must share interior points. This means some of y must be inside x, which means y and z share interior points (since z is inside x). But this contradicts EC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

I think I've been going around in circles. Let me take a step back and think more systematically.

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - Imagine y in the middle, touching z at a boundary, and x overlapping with y but in a way that x doesn't touch z. This satisfies PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and DC(x,z). This is a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   - Imagine y touching z at a boundary, and x overlapping with y in a way that x also touches z at a boundary. This satisfies PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z). This is a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some common parts, but neither is contained in the other.
   - Imagine y touching z at a boundary, and x overlapping with both y and z in a way that x is not contained in z and z is not contained in x. This satisfies PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z). This is a valid possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - We've established earlier that this is not a possibility because it would require some of y to be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - Similarly, this is not a possibility because it would require some of y to be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - We've established that this is not a possibility because it would require y and z to share interior points, which contradicts EC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - Similarly, this is not a possibility because it would require y and z to share interior points, which contradicts EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   - This is not a possibility because it would require y to overlap with z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z).

Let me double-check #6: TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)).

For this to be true, z would have to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. But y touches z at a boundary (due to EC(y,z)). If z is entirely inside x, then y would have to intrude into x to touch z, which means y and x share interior points. This is consistent with PO(x,y). But we also need to ensure that y and z don't share interior points (due to EC(y,z)). 

Let's try to visualize this:
- z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.
- y touches z at a boundary.
- y and x share interior points (due to PO(x,y)).
- y and z don't share interior points (due to EC(y,z)).

Actually, I think this is a possible configuration. y can touch z at a boundary, and simultaneously, y can overlap with x in a different part. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

Okay, now let's consolidate my understanding.

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some common parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Let me make one more check on TPP(x,z) to make sure I got it right. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. But for PO(x,y) to be true, x and y must overlap in their interiors. This means some of y must be inside x, which means some of y is inside z (since x is inside z). But for EC(y,z) to be true, y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Alright, I think my conclusion is correct. Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some common parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

But, wait, let me double-check PO(x,z) one more time. For this to be true, x and z share interior points. But for EC(y,z) to be true, y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. If x overlaps with both y and z in their interiors, then there's a part of x that's inside both y and z, which means y and z share interior points (via x). This contradicts EC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is not a possibility.

Hmm, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think about this more systematically.

Actually, we need to think about PO in terms of "x and y share parts, but neither is contained in the other."

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z share parts, but neither is entirely contained in the other.

If a part of x is inside z, and a part of x is outside z, and a part of z is outside x, then x and z share parts but neither is contained in the other. Now, we also have PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). This means x and y share parts, and y and z touch at a boundary.

But wait, if a part of x is inside z, and a part of x is inside y (due to PO(x,y)), then there could be a part of x that's inside both y and z. But for EC(y,z) to be true, y and z don't share interior points. This suggests there can't be a part of x inside both y and z simultaneously. But I'm not convinced this is a contradiction.

Perhaps it's possible for x to overlap with y in one part and overlap with z in a completely separate part, such that there's no part of x that's inside both y and z simultaneously.

Let's see if I can visualize this:
- x overlaps with y (due to PO(x,y)).
- x overlaps with z (assuming PO(x,z)).
- y and z touch at a boundary (due to EC(y,z)).

Hmm, if y and z only touch at a boundary, and x overlaps with both y and z, then there's a risk that some part of x could be inside both y and z, which would contradict EC(y,z).

Actually, I think the key is that for EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. If x overlaps with both y and z in their interiors, then there's a part of x that's inside both y and z, which means y and z share interior points (via x). This contradicts EC(y,z).

So, my updated conclusion is that given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

No, wait, I'm not sure about PO(x,z). Actually, let me think about it differently. The RCC-8 relations are based on point-set topology. 

For PO(x,y) to be true, it means the intersection of the interiors of x and y is non-empty, the interior of x minus the interior of y is non-empty, and the interior of y minus the interior of x is non-empty.

For EC(y,z) to be true, it means the intersection of the closures of y and z is non-empty, but the intersection of the interiors of y and z is empty.

Now, for PO(x,z) to be true, it means the intersection of the interiors of x and z is non-empty, the interior of x minus the interior of z is non-empty, and the interior of z minus the interior of x is non-empty.

If the intersection of the interiors of x and y is non-empty, and the intersection of the interiors of x and z is non-empty, does this mean the intersection of the interiors of y and z is non-empty? Not necessarily.

Imagine a point p in the interior of x. It can either be in the interior of y, or in the interior of z, but not both (because the intersection of the interiors of y and z is empty). So, the interior of x can be divided into two disjoint parts: one that overlaps with the interior of y, and another that overlaps with the interior of z.

So, PO(x,z) is a possibility. In fact, let me revalidate TPPi(x,z) as well. (I think TPPi(x,z) is also valid, but let me check).

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, it means the interior of z is a subset of the interior of x, and the closure of z intersects the boundary of x. If the interior of z is a subset of the interior of x, and y and z touch at a boundary, then y must also touch x at a boundary. But for PO(x,y), x and y share interior points. This means some of y must be inside x, which is consistent with y touching z at a boundary (since z is inside x). And for EC(y,z), y and z don't share interior points, which is also consistent with z being inside x and y partially overlapping with x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

To consolidate, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some common parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me draw this out once more to make sure I have the correct answer.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - Imagine y in the middle, touching z at a boundary, and x overlapping with y in a part of y that doesn't touch z. This satisfies PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and DC(x,z). This is a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   - Imagine y touching z at a boundary, and x overlapping with y in a way that x also touches z at a boundary. This satisfies PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z). This is a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some common parts, but neither is contained in the other.
   - Imagine y touching z at a boundary, and x overlapping with y in a way that x also overlaps with z but neither x nor z is contained in the other. For this to work, I need to make sure that y and z don't share interior points. If x overlaps with y in its interior, and x overlaps with z in its interior, wouldn't this mean y and z share interior points via x? Not necessarily. The part of x that overlaps with y's interior can be distinct from the part of x that overlaps with z's interior. This allows x to overlap with both y and z without causing y and z to share interior points.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - For this to be true, x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. But for PO(x,y) to be true, x and y overlap in their interiors. This means some of y must be inside x, which means some of y is inside z (since x is inside z). But for EC(y,z) to be true, y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - For this to be true, x is entirely inside z's interior. But for PO(x,y) to be true, x and y overlap in their interiors. This means some of y must be inside x, which means some of y is inside z's interior (since x is inside z's interior). But for EC(y,z) to be true, y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. This is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - For this to be true, z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. But y touches z at a boundary (due to EC(y,z)). If z is entirely inside x, then y would have to intrude into x to touch z, which means y and x share interior points. This is consistent with PO(x,y). And for EC(y,z), y and z don't share interior points, which is also consistent with z being inside x and y partially overlapping with x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - For this to be true, z is entirely inside x's interior, away from x's boundary. But for EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary. If z is inside x's interior, away from x's boundary, and y touches z at a boundary, then y must be inside x to touch z. This means y and x share interior points, which is consistent with PO(x,y). But wait, if z is entirely inside x's interior, how can y touch z at a boundary without y also sharing interior points with z? It seems there's a contradiction here. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   - For this to be true, x and z are the same region. But for PO(x,y), x and y overlap in their interiors, and for EC(y,z), y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. These two requirements are contradictory if x and z are the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

That said, I need to revisit my reasoning for #3: PO(x,z).

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z share interior points, but neither is entirely contained in the other.

For EC(y,z) to be true, y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

For PO(x,y) to be true, x and y share interior points, but neither is entirely contained in the other.

If x shares interior points with both y and z, then there's a part of x that's inside both y and z, which means y and z share interior points (via x). But this contradicts EC(y,z).

Actually, wait. When I say "x shares interior points with both y and z", I mean there's a part of x that's inside y and a (potentially different) part of x that's inside z. It doesn't necessarily mean there's a part of x that's inside both y and z simultaneously. x can have one part that's inside y and another, disjoint part that's inside z.

Hmm, but then would PO(x,z) and PO(x,y) still hold?

For PO(x,y) to be true, x and y must have a non-empty intersection of their interiors. Let's denote this as int(x) ∩ int(y) ≠ ∅.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must have a non-empty intersection of their interiors. That is, int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅.

For EC(y,z) to be true, y and z must not share interior points. That is, int(y) ∩ int(z) = ∅.

Now, if int(x) ∩ int(y) ≠ ∅ and int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅, does this imply int(y) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅?

Not necessarily. Let's denote the part of x's interior that's inside y's interior as int(x) ∩ int(y), and the part of x's interior that's inside z's interior as int(x) ∩ int(z).

For these two intersections to be non-empty, it's sufficient that there's a point in the interior of x that's also in the interior of y, and another point in the interior of x that's also in the interior of z. These two points don't have to be the same.

In other words, it's possible for int(x) ∩ int(y) ≠ ∅ and int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅ while still having int(y) ∩ int(z) = ∅. 

So, PO(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

To consolidate, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some common parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check the definition of PO(x,z).

For PO(x,z) to be true, the intersection of the interiors of x and z is non-empty, the interior of x minus the interior of z is non-empty, and the interior of z minus the interior of x is non-empty.

Topologically, this means x and z overlap in some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Now, if x and z overlap in some parts, and y touches z only at a boundary (due to EC(y,z)), then y can't overlap with the part of x that's inside z (because that would make y and z share interior points, which contradicts EC(y,z)).

But for PO(x,y) to be true, x and y must overlap in some parts. So, y must overlap with a part of x that's outside z.

It's possible for x to overlap with z in one part and overlap with y in a completely disjoint part, such that there's no part of x that's inside both y and z simultaneously. This would satisfy PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

So, PO(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

To consolidate once more, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some common parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Let me check TPPi(x,z) once more to make sure I got it right.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true (which is equivalent to TPP(z,x)), z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. But for EC(y,z) to be true, y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. This means the part of z that touches y must also be at the boundary of x. Is this possible? Yes, z can be entirely inside x, touch the boundary of x at the same point where y touches z. And for PO(x,y), x and y overlap in some parts. This means some of y is inside x, which is consistent with y touching z at a boundary (since z is inside x).

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

To finalize, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some common parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

These are the four possible relationships between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected
   - This is possible. x can overlap with a part of y that doesn't touch z.

2. EC(x,z): Externally connected
   - This is possible. x can overlap with y and extend to touch z at its boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping
   - This is possible. x can overlap with y and also overlap with z, without being contained in z or containing z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   - Not possible. If x were inside z and PO(x,y), then some part of y would have to be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   - Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   - This is possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary at the same point where z touches y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   - Not possible. If z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, z couldn't touch y's boundary as required by EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   - Not possible. If x and z were identical, y couldn't both partially overlap x and only touch z externally.
