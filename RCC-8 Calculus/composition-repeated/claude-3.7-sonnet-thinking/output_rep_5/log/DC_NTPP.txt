PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem systematically. 

First, let me understand what the relations DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) tell us:
- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. They are completely separate.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. In other words, y is strictly inside z with a gap between y and z's boundary.

Now I need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z.

Let's consider each of the eight RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x is disconnected from z?
   Since y is strictly inside z (with a gap to z's boundary), and x is disconnected from y, it's possible that x is completely outside of z. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x touches the boundary of z but doesn't share interior points?
   Since x is disconnected from y, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, x could potentially touch z's boundary while still being disconnected from y. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x partially overlaps with z?
   Since x is disconnected from y, and y is strictly inside z, x could overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since x is disconnected from y, and y is strictly inside z, it's possible for x to be a separate part inside z that touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean x is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. Since x is disconnected from y, and y is strictly inside z, it's possible for x to be another separate part strictly inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is strictly inside z, so y would also be inside x. But this contradicts DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is strictly inside x. But again, since y is strictly inside z, y would be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are identical?
   If x and z are the same, and y is strictly inside z, then y would be strictly inside x. But this contradicts DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, let me rethink the TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) cases to make sure my reasoning is correct:

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. We also know that y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)). 

Now, if x and y are disconnected (DC(x,y)), they must not share any spatial parts. Is it possible for both x and y to be parts of z while being disconnected? Yes, as long as they occupy different portions of z and don't overlap. So TPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, y is also strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)). As long as x and y occupy different portions of z and don't overlap, they can be disconnected. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

So, my final answer is unchanged:
The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let's be even more careful. Let me draw out these relationships spatially to make sure I'm not missing anything.

1. DC(x,z): x is completely outside of z.
   ```
   +-------+      +-------+
   |       |      |       |
   |   x   |      |   z   |
   |       |      |   +---+--+
   +-------+      |   |  y  |
                  |   +-----+
                  |       |
                  +-------+
   ```
   This is consistent with DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): x touches z's boundary but doesn't share interior points.
   ```
   +-------+
   |       |  +-------+
   |   z   |  |       |
   |   +---+--+   x   |
   |   |  y  |  |       |
   |   +-----+  +-------+
   |       |
   +-------+
   ```
   This is consistent with DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
   ```
   +-------+
   |       |  +-------+
   |   z   |  |       |
   |   +---+--+---+   |
   |   |  y  |  x |   |
   |   +-----+----+   |
   |       |          |
   +-------+          |
             +--------+
   ```
   This is consistent with DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   ```
   +---------------+
   |               |
   |      z        |
   | +-----+ +---+ |
   | |  y  | | x | |
   | +-----+ +---+ |
   |               |
   +---------------+
   ```
   This is consistent with DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   ```
   +-------------------+
   |                   |
   |        z          |
   |   +-----+ +---+   |
   |   |  y  | | x |   |
   |   +-----+ +---+   |
   |                   |
   +-------------------+
   ```
   This is consistent with DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

So, after drawing out the relationships, I confirm that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me check one more time just to be sure. Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- NTPP(y,z): y is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary.

I need to ensure the derived relationships between x and z are consistent with these given relationships.

1. DC(x,z): x is completely outside of z.
   If x is outside of z, and y is inside z, then x and y are definitely disconnected. This is consistent.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z's boundary but doesn't share interior points.
   If x touches z's boundary but doesn't share interior points with z, and y is strictly inside z, then x and y are disconnected. This is consistent.

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
   If x partially overlaps with z, and y is strictly inside z, then as long as the part of z that overlaps with x doesn't include y, x and y remain disconnected. This is consistent.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is strictly inside z, then as long as x and y occupy different portions of z and don't overlap, they remain disconnected. This is consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If x is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is also strictly inside z, then as long as x and y occupy different portions of z and don't overlap, they remain disconnected. This is consistent.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Oh wait, I should double-check the definition of PO(x,y) one more time. PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. 

If PO(x,z), then x and z share a spatial part. But we also know that y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x and y are disconnected (DC(x,y)). 

Could there be a conflict here? Let's see. If x and z share a spatial part, it means there's a region that's both part of x and part of z. Let's call this shared region S. Now, y is strictly inside z, which means it's a part of z. But it doesn't mean y is necessarily part of S. In fact, since x and y are disconnected, y can't be part of S.

So, it's possible for PO(x,z) to be true while still maintaining DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

I've checked all eight RCC-8 relations, and I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relations can hold between x and z given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x could be completely outside z while y is inside z. This is consistent.

2. EC(x,z): x could touch z's boundary without overlapping z. Since y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), x and y remain disconnected. This is consistent.

3. PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z in areas that don't contain y. This maintains DC(x,y) while allowing overlap with z. This is consistent.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z (touching z's boundary) in a different region than y. This is consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z in a different region than y. This is consistent.

6. TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z): All impossible because these would require z to be part of x, which would mean y is part of x (contradicting DC(x,y)).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
