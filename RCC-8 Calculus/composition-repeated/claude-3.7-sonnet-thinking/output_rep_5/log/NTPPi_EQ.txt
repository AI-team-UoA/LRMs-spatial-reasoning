PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). That is, y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

2. EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident, or y and z are the same region.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Given that y and z are equivalent (EQ(y,z)), anything true about y is also true about z. Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(y,x)), it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPP(z,x) is true.

Converting this to the relation between x and z, we get NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check:

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is completely contained in x without touching x's boundary.
If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same region.
Therefore, z is also completely contained in x without touching x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me rethink this...

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). So y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.

Since y and z are the same region, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z is also a non-tangential proper part of x.

So NTPP(z,x) is true, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

OK, to be 100% sure, let's check again using the definitions:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident.
Given these, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since y and z are coincident, whatever spatial relationship y has with x, z also has the same relationship with x. Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, z is also completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait a second. Let me rethink this yet again.

We are told:
- NTPPi(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident.

Therefore, if y and z are the same region, and x is a non-tangential proper part of y, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z), not NTPPi(x,z) as I previously stated.

I got confused because I was interpreting NTPPi(x,y) incorrectly. Let's be clear:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which is y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).

Given that NTPPi(x,y), x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
Given that EQ(y,z), y and z are the same region.
Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z).

Let's make sure I'm using the definitions properly:

- NTPPi(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, or equivalently, y properly contains x and x doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are the same region, and y properly contains x with x not touching y's boundary, z also properly contains x with x not touching z's boundary. This is the definition of NTPP(x,z).

OK, let me go back to the definitions I provided:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).

So, NTPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. In other words, y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are the same region, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, let me go back to the definitions again:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This is the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, which means they are exactly the same region.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), and y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary (NTPP(y,x) or NTPPi(x,y)), it follows that z is also part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is the definition of NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I'm now confident in my answer. The only possible relationship between x and z given the conditions is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me verify this with a concrete example:

Imagine x is a large circle. Inside x, but not touching its boundary, is a smaller circle y. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Now, if z is exactly the same as y (EQ(y,z)), then z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually let me double-check to be 100% sure:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are the same region, and y is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary, z is also properly contained within x without touching x's boundary. This is the definition of NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, so the final answer is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step:

1) NTPPi(x,y) means the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

2) EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident - they are exactly the same region.

Given these two facts, I need to determine the relation between x and z.

Since y and z are coincident (they are the same region), and y is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, then z must also be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).
