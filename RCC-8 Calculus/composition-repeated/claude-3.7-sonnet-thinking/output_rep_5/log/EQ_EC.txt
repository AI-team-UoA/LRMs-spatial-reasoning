PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this problem step by step. We have two given relations:
1. EQ(x,y) - meaning x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
2. EC(y,z) - meaning y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts

Now I need to determine what relationship(s) can hold between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), that means x and y are identical in terms of their spatial extent. They occupy exactly the same region. Therefore, x will have the same relationship with z that y has with z.

Given that EC(y,z), and x is spatially identical to y, then x must also be externally connected to z.

So the answer is: EC(x,z)

Let me double-check this. If x and y are coincident (same spatial region), and y touches z at a boundary (EC), then x must also touch z at the same boundary. No other RCC-8 relation is possible in this case.

So the answer is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts

Since x and y are coincident (EQ), they occupy precisely the same region with the same boundaries. Therefore, x will have exactly the same spatial relationship with z that y has with z.

Since y is externally connected to z (EC), then x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
