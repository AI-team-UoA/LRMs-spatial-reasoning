PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the given relations:

1. NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

2. TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given these, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

We know that:
- y is fully contained within x (and does not touch x's boundary)
- z is fully contained within y (and touches y's boundary)

Therefore, z is definitely contained within x. But the question is, does z touch x's boundary?

Since z touches y's boundary, and y does not touch x's boundary, it means that z is surrounded by y, which is surrounded by x. Therefore, z does not touch x's boundary.

So, the relation between x and z should be NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

However, let me double-check this by considering other possible relations and seeing if they could hold.

Could DC(x,z) (disconnected) be possible? No, since z is contained within y, which is contained within x.

Could EC(x,z) (externally connected) be possible? No, for the same reason.

Could PO(x,z) (partially overlapping) be possible? No, since z is fully contained within y, which is fully contained within x.

Could TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part) be possible? No, since x is larger than y, which is larger than z, it can't be that x is a part of z.

Could NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part) be possible? No, for the same reason as TPP.

Could TPPi(x,z) (tangential proper part inverse) be possible? No, because even though z is contained within x, it doesn't touch x's boundary (as explained above).

Could EQ(x,z) (equal) be possible? No, because x is larger than y, which is larger than z.

So, the only possible relation is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider. The key insight is understanding what TPPi(y,z) means. It means that z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, since z touches y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, it means z doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider once more, paying careful attention to the meanings of the relations.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully contained within x without touching x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
- y is fully contained within x without touching x's boundary.
- z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is fully contained within y, and y is fully contained within x, it follows that z is fully contained within x.

Now, does z touch x's boundary? We know that z touches y's boundary, but y doesn't touch x's boundary. So, z is still surrounded by some part of y, which is then surrounded by x. Therefore, z does not touch x's boundary.

This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, to make sure, let me try to draw this out.

Using ASCII, let's represent x as the outermost region, y as the middle region, and z as the innermost region:

```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
x             x
x   yyyyy     x
x   y   y     x
x   y z y     x
x   y z y     x
x   yyyyy     x
x             x
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Here, z is touching y's boundary, and y is not touching x's boundary. Since z is contained within y and y is contained within x, z is definitely contained within x. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary, z can't touch x's boundary either.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I'm now having second thoughts. Let me reconsider the case of TPPi(y,z) and what it means.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is fully contained within y, and z touches y's boundary.

But since z touches y's boundary, it doesn't necessarily mean z is "surrounded" by y on all sides. z could touch the boundary of y at a point where y meets another region. Or in our case, z could touch the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x. In that case, z would not touch the boundary of x.

Let me try to draw another situation:

```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
x             x
x   yyyyy     x
x   y   y     x
x   y z y     x
x   y   y     x
x   yyyyy     x
x             x
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

In this depiction, z is touching y's boundary, but since y doesn't touch x's boundary, z doesn't touch x's boundary either. This would make NTPP(z,x) true, or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

However, it's also possible to have a situation like:

```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
x             x
x   yyyyy     x
x   y   y     x
x   y z y     x
x   y z y     x
x   yyzzy     x
x             x
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

In this case, z is touching y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch x's boundary. So z still doesn't touch x's boundary, which again makes NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) true.

But, there's one more case to consider:

```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
x             x
x   yyyyy     x
x   y   y     x
x   y z y     x
x   yzzy      x
x   yyyy      x
x             x
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

In this depiction, z is touching y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary. Here, z touches both y's and x's boundaries. This would make TPP(z,x) true, or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

Actually, I should be more careful with my ASCII diagrams, since they can be misleading.

Let's be explicit about the definitions. 

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). NTPP(y,x) means y is a proper part of x and does not share any boundary with x. In other words, y is "fully inside" x.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and shares at least one boundary point with y. In other words, z is "inside" y and "touches" y from the inside.

Given the above, we're trying to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since NTPP(y,x) means y is fully inside x, and TPP(z,y) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary, we can say that z is definitely inside x (because it's inside y, which is inside x).

Now, the question is whether z touches x's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, then TPP(z,x) (or TPPi(x,z)) would be true. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPP(z,x) (or NTPPi(x,z)) would be true.

Let's think about this differently. For z to touch x's boundary, z would need to touch y at a point where y touches x. But NTPP(y,x) means y doesn't touch x's boundary. So, z cannot touch x's boundary through y.

Therefore, z is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, the more I think about it the more I realize I'm making an error in my previous reasoning.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary).
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is inside y and touches y's boundary).

We're trying to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since y is fully inside x, and z is inside y, we can deduce that z is inside x.

Now, we need to determine whether z touches x's boundary. Given that y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPP(y,x)), and z is inside y, it's not possible for z to touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating things and getting confused.

Here's a clearer way to think about it. Imagine nested shapes:

x is the largest shape.
y is fully inside x (doesn't touch x's boundary).
z is inside y (and touches y's boundary).

If z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z is inside x. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, z cannot touch x's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I think I might be making an error in my interpretation of TPPi(y,z). Let me clarify:

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and shares some boundary with y. If I try to visualize this, I'd have z inside y, with z touching y's boundary at at least one point.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Since y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, and z is inside y, we can say z is inside x. Now, does z touch x's boundary? Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait a second. Let me be more careful about the definitions again.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y and shares some boundary with y.

So, z is inside y and touches y's boundary. Does this mean that z is "on the edge" of y? Not exactly. It means z is inside y, and there's at least one point where z meets y's boundary.

Now, if y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, then z is inside x. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary, z (which is inside y) cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, let's very precisely recap what's going on and what we know:

From NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is non-tangentially proper part of x, i.e., y is fully contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

From TPPi(y,z), we know that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So, z is within y, which is within x. That means z is within x. Now, does z touch x's boundary? Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is confined within y, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Let's think about it one more time:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). NTPP(y,x) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is fully inside x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is fully inside y, and z touches the boundary of y.

Let's denote "is a proper part of" as "⊂". Then, we have:

z ⊂ y ⊂ x

Now, the question is, what is the relationship between z and x? We know z is a proper part of x (since z is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of x). So, it's either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

For it to be TPP(z,x), z would have to touch the boundary of x. But since y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z is confined within y, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, it's NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

OK, after many considerations, my final answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, there's one more case to consider, and I need to be careful. Let's say we're looking at this from a 2D perspective, just to visualize.

Imagine a situation where:
- x is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle fully inside x (i.e., it doesn't touch x's boundary).
- z is a small circle inside y that touches y's boundary.

Given this, z is definitely inside x. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary, z also doesn't touch x's boundary. This confirms our conclusion: NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, on further reflection I don't think I've been clear in my thinking, because I've been forgetting that TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. Let me continue.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is fully inside y, and z touches the boundary of y at at least one point.

If y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z only touches the boundary of y, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's make sure about which relation is the inverse of which:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b.
TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a, which is the same as TPP(b,a).

NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b.
NTPPi(a,b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a, which is the same as NTPP(b,a).

OK, so if we have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Then z is inside y, which is inside x. And since y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z (which is inside y) doesn't touch the boundary of x either. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x).

Wait, I need to be careful about the direction of the relation. NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The inverse of this is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So, they mean the same thing!

So, the answer is indeed NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think more carefully:

NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x, and z does not touch the boundary of x.

NTPPi(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which doesn't make sense given our scenario (because x is larger than z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not the inverse of NTPP(z,x) in terms of the relationship, but in terms of the arguments. It's NTPP(z,x) with the arguments swapped.

Therefore, the correct relationship is NTPP(z,x), not NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's go back to the definitions:

NTPPi(a,b) is the inverse of NTPP(a,b). NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b. So, NTPPi(a,b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a.

With this, if we have NTPP(z,x), it means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The inverse would be NTPPi(z,x), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But the question is asking for the relationship between x and z, not z and x.

OK, I think I know where my confusion is coming from. Let me simplify.

If we have NTPP(z,x), then the relationship from x to z is NTPPi(x,z). They are the same relationship, just from different perspectives. NTPP(z,x) is from z's perspective, while NTPPi(x,z) is from x's perspective.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I see why I'm getting confused. So, let me clarify more:

NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b.
NTPPi(a,b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a. 

In our scenario, we've determined that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is written as NTPP(z,x). From x's perspective, the relationship to z is NTPPi(x,z), which means the same thing: z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, let me reconsider:

From NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
From TPPi(y,z), we know that z is a tangential proper part of y.
Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, and z is inside y, it follows that z is inside x. And since y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z (which is inside y) doesn't touch the boundary of x either. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x).

The question asks for the relationship between x and z. From z's perspective, it's NTPP(z,x). From x's perspective, it's NTPPi(x,z). These both mean the same thing: z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I'm getting too caught up in the notation. Let's simplify and focus on the relationships:

Given:
- y is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

From these, we can deduce that z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. 

Now, the question is: what's the relationship between x and z? 

If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then the relationship is: "z is a non-tangential proper part of x". In the RCC-8 calculus, this is written as NTPP(z,x).

But the question asked for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. If we switch the arguments, we get: "x has z as a non-tangential proper part". In the RCC-8 calculus, this is written as NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check using the basic definitions:

A relationship R(a, b) in RCC-8 says something about how regions a and b relate to each other in space. The 'i' in TPPi and NTPPi stands for "inverse", so TPPi(a, b) is the inverse of TPP(a, b), which means TPP(b, a). Similarly, NTPPi(a, b) is the inverse of NTPP(a, b), which means NTPP(b, a).

Given:
- NTPPi(x, y): This means NTPP(y, x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y, z): This means TPP(z, y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now, we have to determine the relationship between x and z.

We know that y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary. It follows that z is inside x without touching x's boundary, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z, x).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z, x), or if we flip the arguments, NTPPi(x, z).

But, to be absolutely clear, the question asks for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. That is, we want R(x, z), not R(z, x). In the RCC-8 calculus, R(x, z) would be NTPPi(x, z) if z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

OK, I think NTPPi(x, z) is the only correct answer. But let me double-check the definitions one more time:

NTPPi(x, y) means NTPP(y, x), which means y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary.
TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

From these, we deduce that z is inside x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z, x) or NTPPi(x, z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

OK, I think I've finally got it. Let's summarize:

- NTPPi(x, y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, y is fully inside x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y, z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is inside y, and z touches the boundary of y.

From this, we can deduce that z is inside x (because z is inside y, which is inside x). And since y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z (which is inside y) doesn't touch the boundary of x either. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPPi(x, z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship(s) can hold between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's break down what these relations mean:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

2. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

From these facts, I can determine:
- z is completely inside y (from TPPi(y,z))
- y is completely inside x (from NTPPi(x,y))
- Therefore, z is completely inside x

Does z touch x's boundary? Since y does not touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, z cannot reach x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

This means NTPP(z,x), which from x's perspective is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
