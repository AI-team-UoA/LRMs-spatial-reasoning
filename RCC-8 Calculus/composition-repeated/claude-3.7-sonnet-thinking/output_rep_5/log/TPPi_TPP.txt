PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think this through step by step.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): This means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Now, I need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z. 

I know that y is a proper part of both x and z. From TPPi(x,y), y is contained in x, and from TPP(y,z), y is contained in z. 

Let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries. This is not possible because y is a part of both x and z, so they share more than just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Since y is a proper part of both x and z, it's possible that x and z overlap in the region occupied by y (and possibly more), but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. If x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary, then y (which is a proper part of x) would also be a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This seems unlikely because if x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, then y (which touches x's boundary by TPPi(x,y)) would also not touch z's boundary, which contradicts TPP(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because if z is properly contained in x, then y cannot be a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)), while also having x as a proper part of y (from TPPi(x,y)).

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for similar reasons as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because if x = z, then y cannot simultaneously be a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)) and have x as a proper part of y (from TPPi(x,y)).

Let me double-check my reasoning for each of these:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then there's no way y can be a part of both, so this is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, then there's still no way y can be a part of both, so this is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This seems possible. y is a part of both x and z, but x and z can still partially overlap.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's reconsider the constraints:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, which contradicts the fact that they both contain y. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z only touch at their boundaries, which again contradicts the fact that they both contain y. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, and that y touches the boundaries of both x and z, it's plausible that x and z overlap in a way that neither is fully contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary, then y (which is a proper part of x) would also be a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). Moreover, since y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), and x touches z's boundary (from the assumption of TPP(x,z)), it's consistent that y touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then y (which is a proper part of x and, by transitivity, a proper part of z) would not touch z's boundary. But this contradicts TPP(y,z), which states that y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is properly contained in x, then y (which is a proper part of z) would also be a proper part of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y) (which means x is a proper part of y). So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in my logic about TPPi(x,y). Let me think again.

TPPi(x,y) means that TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. It doesn't mean x is a proper part of y.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, which contradicts the fact that they both contain y. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z only touch at their boundaries, which again contradicts the fact that they both contain y. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, it's plausible that x and z overlap in the region occupied by y (and possibly more), but neither is fully contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary, then y (which is a proper part of x) would also be a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then y (which is a proper part of x and, by transitivity, a proper part of z) might not touch z's boundary. This seems to contradict TPP(y,z), which states that y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is likely impossible.

Actually, let me reconsider. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x doesn't touch z's boundary. But y, being a tangential proper part of x, touches x's boundary. It's possible that the part of y that touches x's boundary is within z, not touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is still a possibility.

But I need to be more careful. If y is a tangential proper part of z, then y touches z's boundary. And if y is a tangential proper part of x, then y touches x's boundary. Now, if x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(x,z)), then the part of y that touches x's boundary must be within z, away from z's boundary. But then, how can y touch z's boundary? It seems like a contradiction.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify.

Given that y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, it touches the boundaries of both. If x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(x,z)), then the boundary of x is completely within z. If y touches this boundary of x, it still doesn't guarantee that y touches the boundary of z. So, it seems NTPP(x,z) is inconsistent with the given conditions.

Actually, I think I was overlooking something here. We have TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x, and TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside both x and z, touching the boundaries of both.

Let me reconsider the relationship between x and z.

Given that y is inside both x and z, x and z must have a non-empty intersection. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

If y is a tangential proper part of x and a tangential proper part of z, then y is properly contained in both. This suggests that either x and z have a partial overlap (PO), or one is contained in the other (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi), or they are equal (EQ).

Let's consider the possible relationships again:

1. PO(x,z): This is plausible. x and z overlap in the region occupied by y (and possibly more), but neither is fully contained in the other.

2. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then y (which is a proper part of x) would also be a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). So this is plausible.

3. NTPP(x,z): As I argued earlier, if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then the part of y that touches x's boundary would be inside z, away from z's boundary. But this would contradict TPP(y,z), which states that y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

4. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then y (which is a proper part of z) would also be a proper part of x, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y). So this is plausible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then the part of y that touches z's boundary would be inside x, away from x's boundary. But this would contradict TPPi(x,y), which states that y touches x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

6. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then y is a tangential proper part of both, which is consistent with the given conditions. So this is plausible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I think there's something wrong with my reasoning about EQ(x,z). If x and z are equal, and y is a proper part of both, there's no contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is still a possibility.

But the more I think about it, I wonder about the consistency of TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z). Let's reconsider these.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.
TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.

These two cannot be true simultaneously (unless x = z, which would be EQ(x,z)). So at most one of TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) can be true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually I need to check if EQ(x,z) is really possible, because I'm not sure if I was very clear in my reasoning. I'll recheck this case. If x and z are equal, then:
1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (and hence z, since x = z). This is consistent.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (and hence x, since x = z). This is consistent.

So there's no contradiction if x and z are equal. EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Let me also recheck the other cases:

For PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, and y is contained in both, then y is contained in the intersection of x and z. Since y touches the boundaries of both x and z, it's possible that the boundaries of x and z run through the region occupied by y in a way that y touches both. So PO(x,z) is plausible.

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then y (which is a proper part of x) would also be a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). The question is whether y can touch the boundaries of both x and z. Since x touches the boundary of z, it's plausible that y touches the boundary of x where x touches the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is plausible.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then y (which is a proper part of x) could be a proper part of z as well, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). The question is whether y can touch the boundaries of both x and z. Since z touches the boundary of x, it's plausible that y touches the boundary of z where z touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is plausible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z).

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given the nesting, y is also properly contained in z. For TPP(y,z) to be true, y must touch z's boundary. This is plausible because x touches z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, so y could touch z's boundary at the same point where x touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. However, for TPP(y,z) to be true, y must be properly contained in z. If z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of x, it doesn't necessarily mean that y is a proper part of z. y and z could be completely separate regions within x. So, TPPi(x,z) doesn't seem consistent with the given conditions.

Actually, let me think more clearly about TPPi(x,z). We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then by transitivity, y is a proper part of x. This is consistent with TPPi(x,y). The only concern is whether y would be tangential to x. Since y is tangential to z, and z is tangential to x, it's plausible that y touches the boundary of x at the same point where z touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) still seems like a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Let me think again about the case of TPPi(x,z).

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then by transitivity, y is a proper part of x. This is consistent with TPPi(x,y). But for TPPi(x,y) to be true, y must touch the boundary of x. If y is properly contained in z, and z is properly contained in x, then for y to touch the boundary of x, it must touch the boundary of z where z touches the boundary of x. This is plausible.

Alright, so TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually let me double-check once more. From my understanding of RCC-8, the "tangentiality" refers to whether regions touch at their boundaries. 

- TPP(a,b): a is a proper part of b, and a touches the boundary of b.
- NTPP(a,b): a is a proper part of b, and a does not touch the boundary of b.
- TPPi(a,b): b is a proper part of a, and b touches the boundary of a.
- NTPPi(a,b): b is a proper part of a, and b does not touch the boundary of a.

In our case:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This contradicts the fact that they both contain y, so DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries. This also contradicts the fact that they both contain y, so EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is plausible. If x and z overlap in the region occupied by y (and possibly more), but neither is fully contained in the other, then PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of z. If y is a proper part of x, and x is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). If y touches the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, then it's plausible that y touches the boundary of z at the same point where x touches the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. If y touches the boundary of x, and x is completely inside z away from z's boundary, then y would also be away from z's boundary. But this contradicts TPP(y,z), which states that y touches the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z). If x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch the boundary of z, then there's a "buffer" region within z that surrounds x. Now, if y is a tangential proper part of x, then y touches the boundary of x. But this doesn't mean y also touches the boundary of z. Since there's a buffer region between x and the boundary of z, y would be away from the boundary of z. This contradicts TPP(y,z), which states that y touches the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of x. If y is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x, then y is a proper part of x, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y). For y to touch the boundary of x, given that y is inside z and z is inside x, it's plausible that y touches the boundary of z where z touches the boundary of x. This would allow y to "touch" the boundary of x through z. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. If z is completely inside x away from x's boundary, then any part of z (including y) would also be away from x's boundary. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which states that y touches the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x = z, then y is a tangential proper part of both, which is consistent with the given conditions. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

But let me double-check the TPPi(x,z) case. We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches the boundary of x. If y is a tangential proper part of z, then y touches the boundary of z. It's plausible that y touches the boundary of z where z touches the boundary of x, allowing y to "indirectly" touch the boundary of x. This would satisfy TPPi(x,y), which states that y touches the boundary of x. However, I need to be careful here, because touching the boundary of x "indirectly" through z might not be the same as directly touching the boundary of x, which is what TPPi(x,y) implies.

Let's think about it geometrically. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches the boundary of x at least at one point. If y is a tangential proper part of z, then y touches the boundary of z at least at one point. If y touches the boundary of z at a point where z touches the boundary of x, then y would also touch the boundary of x. This would satisfy TPPi(x,y).

However, there's also the scenario where y touches the boundary of z at a point where z doesn't touch the boundary of x. In this case, y would not touch the boundary of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y). Since we're considering all possible configurations, and there's at least one configuration where TPPi(x,z) leads to a contradiction with the given conditions, TPPi(x,z) might not be a universally valid answer.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this again. In the context of RCC-8, when we say a region touches the boundary of another region, it means they share a point on their boundaries. Let's reconsider the case of TPPi(x,z) with this in mind.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of y and x share at least one point.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of y and z share at least one point.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x share at least one point.

If z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x share at least one point (call it P), and if y is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of x. For y to touch the boundary of x (as required by TPPi(x,y)), there must be a point Q where the boundaries of y and x meet. It's plausible that Q = P, meaning y touches the boundary of z at the same point where z touches the boundary of x. But it's also plausible that Q ≠ P, meaning y touches the boundary of x at a different point than where z touches the boundary of x.

So, TPPi(x,z) is still a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I think I had a misconception in my understanding. In RCC-8, "touching" refers to sharing at least one point, and "tangential" refers to the situation where two regions share at least one boundary point but do not overlap in their interiors. Let me reconsider with this understanding.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y shares at least one boundary point with x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z, and y shares at least one boundary point with z.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because they both contain y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect, meaning they touch at their boundaries but do not overlap. This is also not possible because they both contain y, which means they must overlap.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some region but neither is a part of the other. This is plausible. y is a part of both x and z, but x and z might have parts that are not shared.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is plausible. If x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z, then y (being a proper part of x) is also a proper part of z. If y touches the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, it's plausible that y also touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is a proper part of z but does not touch the boundary of z. If y touches the boundary of x, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y might not touch the boundary of z. This would contradict TPP(y,z), which states that y touches the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is plausible. If z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, and y is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of x. For y to touch the boundary of x (as required by TPPi(x,y)), y could touch the boundary of z where z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is a proper part of x but does not touch the boundary of x. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then any part of z (including y) would also not touch the boundary of x. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), which states that y touches the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is plausible. If x = z, then y is a tangential proper part of both.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of the TPP and TPPi relations. As I understand it, TPP(a,b) means "a is a tangential proper part of b", which implies that a is a proper part of b and a shares at least one boundary point with b. And TPPi(a,b) means "b is a tangential proper part of a", which implies that b is a proper part of a and b shares at least one boundary point with a.

So, the given conditions are:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Alright, so TPPi(x,y) means y is properly part of x, and y shares at least one boundary point with x. TPP(y,z) means y is properly part of z, and y shares at least one boundary point with z.

Given that y is properly part of both x and z, and y shares at least one boundary point with both x and z, it's unclear from just these conditions whether x is a part of z, z is a part of x, or neither is a part of the other.

So, our conclusion that the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) still stands.

So let me verify this conclusion once more from first principles.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

We want to find the possible relationships between x and z. There are 8 possible relationships in RCC-8: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

First, we know that y is a part of both x and z. This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), because if x and z were disconnected or only touched at their boundaries, then there would be no way for y to be a part of both.

Now, let's consider the remaining possibilities:

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, with neither being a proper part of the other. If y is a part of both x and z, then y is contained in the intersection of x and z. Since y touches the boundaries of both x and z, it's plausible that the boundaries of x and z run through the region occupied by y in a way that y touches both. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is a proper part of z, then any part of x (including y) is also a part of z. Since y touches the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, it's plausible that y touches the boundary of z where x touches the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch the boundary of z, then there's a "buffer" region within z that surrounds x. If y touches the boundary of x, and x is completely inside z away from z's boundary, then y would be away from the boundary of z. This contradicts TPP(y,z), which states that y touches the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is a proper part of x, then any part of z (including y) is also a part of x. Since y touches the boundary of z, and z touches the boundary of x, it's plausible that y touches the boundary of x where z touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch the boundary of x, then there's a "buffer" region within x that surrounds z. If y touches the boundary of z, and z is completely inside x away from x's boundary, then y would be away from the boundary of x. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), which states that y touches the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If x = z, then y is a tangential proper part of both, which is consistent with the given conditions. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I think I might be overthinking the TPP and TPPi cases. Let me verify once more.

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of z. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x. By transitivity, y is a proper part of z. But for TPP(y,z) to be true, y must also touch the boundary of z. If y touches the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, then it's possible that y touches the boundary of z at the same point where x touches the boundary of z. But it's also possible that y touches the boundary of x at a point where x doesn't touch the boundary of z, in which case y wouldn't touch the boundary of z. Since we need TPP(y,z) to be true in all cases, and there's a possibility where it's not true, TPP(x,z) might not be a valid answer.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. We have:

TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x at some point A.
TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper part of z, and y touches the boundary of z at some point B.

Now, let's consider TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of z at some point C. Since y is a proper part of x, and x is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). But we also need y to touch the boundary of z. Given that y touches the boundary of x at point A, and x touches the boundary of z at point C, it's possible that A and C coincide, in which case y would touch the boundary of z. But it's also possible that A and C are different points, and point A is within the interior of z, in which case y wouldn't touch the boundary of z at point A. But remember that we're given TPP(y,z), which means y touches the boundary of z at some point B. It's entirely possible that B is a different point than A, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z at point B.

For instance, imagine a scenario where x is a disk properly contained within z, with x touching the boundary of z at point C. Now, y is a smaller disk properly contained within x, with y touching the boundary of x at point A, which is different from C and is within the interior of z. Additionally, y touches the boundary of z at a point B, which is different from both A and C. This scenario satisfies all the given conditions, and TPP(x,z) is true. So, TPP(x,z) is still a possible relationship.

Similarly, we can construct a scenario where TPPi(x,z) is true: z is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a tangential proper part of both x and z. For instance, z is a disk properly contained within x, with z touching the boundary of x at some point. y is a smaller disk properly contained within z, with y touching the boundary of z and also touching the boundary of x at possibly different points. This scenario satisfies all the given conditions, and TPPi(x,z) is true. So, TPPi(x,z) is also a possible relationship.

So, our conclusion remains unchanged: the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I've been trying to come up with concrete examples to justify that the relationships can occur simultaneously. Let me try to think more abstractly, in terms of definitions.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Let's first list what these mean:
- TPPi(x,y): y ⊂ x and y shares at least one boundary point with x.
- TPP(y,z): y ⊂ z and y shares at least one boundary point with z.

Now, let's consider the constraints these place on the relationship between x and z:

We know y is a part of both x and z. This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z). So x and z must have a non-empty intersection.

For PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then there's a region that's part of both x and z. If y is contained within this intersection, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z, then PO(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x ⊂ z and x shares at least one boundary point with z. Given that y ⊂ x, by transitivity, y ⊂ z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). And since y shares at least one boundary point with x, and x shares at least one boundary point with z, it's plausible that y shares a boundary point with z. But this requires the boundary points to align, which might not always be the case. However, we're given TPP(y,z), which explicitly states that y does share a boundary point with z. So, TPP(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x ⊂ z and x doesn't share any boundary point with z. Since y ⊂ x, by transitivity, y ⊂ z. But for TPP(y,z) to be true, y must share a boundary point with z. If x doesn't share a boundary point with z, then any part of x (including y) would also not share a boundary point with z. This contradicts TPP(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z ⊂ x and z shares at least one boundary point with x. Given that y ⊂ z, by transitivity, y ⊂ x, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y). For TPPi(x,y) to be true, y must share a boundary point with x. And for TPP(y,z) to be true, y must share a boundary point with z. It's plausible that y shares a boundary point with z, and z shares a boundary point with x, and it's also plausible that y shares a boundary point with x directly. Given the constraints, TPPi(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z ⊂ x and z doesn't share any boundary point with x. Since y ⊂ z, by transitivity, y ⊂ x. But for TPPi(x,y) to be true, y must share a boundary point with x. If z doesn't share a boundary point with x, and y is contained within z, then it's unlikely that y would share a boundary point with x. This contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

For EQ(x,z): If x = z, then TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both imply that y is a tangential proper part of the same region (x or z, which are equal). This is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, based on this reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, hang on, I think I might have been mistaken about the NTPPi(x,z) case. Let me think of it in terms of concrete example. Imagine:
- x is a large disk.
- z is a smaller disk properly contained within x, not touching the boundary of x. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z).
- y is an even smaller disk, properly contained within z, touching the boundary of z at some point. So y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(y,z).

Now, for TPPi(x,y) to be true, y must be a tangential proper part of x. We know y is properly contained within z, and z is properly contained within x, so y is properly contained within x. But for y to be a tangential proper part of x, y must touch the boundary of x. However, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, so any region properly contained within z (like y) can't touch the boundary of x either. This contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, with NTPPi(x,z), we can't satisfy TPPi(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Let me double-check once more whether all our other cases can indeed hold:

1. PO(x,z): Picture x and z as overlapping disks, where the overlap is a smaller disk. Place y as an even smaller disk within the overlap, with y touching the boundaries of both x and z. This satisfies TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): Picture z as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside z touching the boundary of z at some point, and y as an even smaller disk inside x touching the boundary of x at the same point where x touches the boundary of z. This satisfies TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): Picture z as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside z not touching the boundary of z, and y as an even smaller disk inside x touching the boundary of x. For TPP(y,z) to be true, y must touch the boundary of z. But if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y, being inside x, can't touch the boundary of z either. This contradicts TPP(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

4. TPPi(x,z): Picture x as a disk, z as a smaller disk inside x touching the boundary of x at some point, and y as an even smaller disk inside z touching the boundary of z at some point. If y touches the boundary of z at the same point where z touches the boundary of x, then y would also touch the boundary of x, satisfying TPPi(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): As we just concluded, this is impossible.

6. EQ(x,z): Picture x and z as the same disk, and y as a smaller disk inside them touching their boundary at some point. This satisfies TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, our conclusion is unchanged: the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Hang on, let me verify the TPP and TPPi cases again; I'm still not sure about TPPi(x,z).

For TPP(x,z): Picture z as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside z touching the boundary of z at some point, and y as an even smaller disk inside x. For TPPi(x,y) to be true, y must touch the boundary of x. For TPP(y,z) to be true, y must touch the boundary of z. It's possible that y touches the boundary of x at the same point where x touches the boundary of z, in which case y would also touch the boundary of z. This would satisfy both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z): Picture x as a disk, z as a smaller disk inside x touching the boundary of x at some point, and y as an even smaller disk inside z. For TPPi(x,y) to be true, y must touch the boundary of x. For TPP(y,z) to be true, y must touch the boundary of z. If y touches the boundary of z at the same point where z touches the boundary of x, then y would also touch the boundary of x. This would satisfy both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

So our conclusion is still that the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, wait, I realize I might be overlooking something in the TPPi(x,z) case. Let's reason through this once more.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

We're considering TPPi(x,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. So, z is a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of x.

Given that y is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x, by transitivity, y is a proper part of x. This is consistent with TPPi(x,y).

For TPPi(x,y) to be true, y must touch the boundary of x. For TPP(y,z) to be true, y must touch the boundary of z.

Imagine x as a disk, z as a smaller disk inside x touching the boundary of x at some point P, and y as an even smaller disk inside z touching the boundary of z at some point Q. If Q and P coincide, then y touches the boundary of z at the same point where z touches the boundary of x. In this case, y would also touch the boundary of x, satisfying TPPi(x,y).

But what if Q and P are different points? In this case, y touches the boundary of z at point Q, which is different from where z touches the boundary of x. Since y is inside z, and point Q is on the boundary of z, if P and Q are different, then point Q would be inside x (not on the boundary of x). In this case, y would not touch the boundary of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y).

So, for TPPi(x,z) to be consistent with the given conditions, we need y to touch the boundary of z at the same point where z touches the boundary of x. This is a specific configuration, and it's not always guaranteed. But it's also not impossible.

Hmm, I just realized that I am being too strict in my interpretation. The conditions TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) don't require that the boundary points where y touches the boundaries of x and z are the same. They just require that y touches both boundaries. So, for TPPi(x,z) to be possible, we need to ensure that y touches the boundary of x even when y and z have different boundary touching points.

Let's reconsider: if z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches the boundary of x at some point P. If y is a tangential proper part of z, then y touches the boundary of z at some point Q. The question is: can y also touch the boundary of x?

If point Q is located such that it's also on the boundary of x, then y touches both the boundary of z and the boundary of x. But if Q is inside x, then y touches the boundary of z but not the boundary of x. This would contradict TPPi(x,y).

Since we're asking for possible relationships, and not relationships that are always true, if there's at least one configuration where TPPi(x,z) is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Imagine x as a disk, z as a smaller disk inside x such that it touches the boundary of x at some arc (not just a point), and y as an even smaller disk inside z such that it touches the boundary of z at a point within that arc. In this case, y touches the boundary of z, and it also touches the boundary of x (since the boundary of z at that point is also the boundary of x). This satisfies both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, our conclusion remains: the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Alright, let's do a final verification by thinking of concrete examples for each of our concluded possible relationships:

1. PO(x,z): Picture x and z as overlapping disks, with the overlap being a smaller disk. Place y inside the overlap such that it touches the boundaries of both x and z. This satisfies TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): Picture z as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside z touching the boundary of z, and y as an even smaller disk inside x touching the boundary of x at the same point where x touches the boundary of z. This satisfies TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. TPPi(x,z): Picture x as a disk, z as a smaller disk inside x touching the boundary of x, and y as an even smaller disk inside z touching the boundary of z at the same point where z touches the boundary of x. This satisfies TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

4. EQ(x,z): Picture x and z as the same disk, and y as a smaller disk inside them touching their boundary. This satisfies TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Picture z as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside z not touching the boundary of z, and y as an even smaller disk inside x touching the boundary of x. For TPP(y,z) to be true, y must touch the boundary of z. But if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, and y is inside x, then y can't touch the boundary of z. This contradicts TPP(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. NTPPi(x,z): Picture x as a disk, z as a smaller disk inside x not touching the boundary of x, and y as an even smaller disk inside z touching the boundary of z. For TPPi(x,y) to be true, y must touch the boundary of x. But if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then y can't touch the boundary of x. This contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. DC(x,z): This was already ruled out, as x and z both contain y.

8. EC(x,z): This was also ruled out, as x and z both contain y.

So, our final conclusion is: the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

Looking at our scenario:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z

Let me analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

First, both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are impossible because x and z both contain y, so they must overlap in some way.

For the remaining relations:

1. PO(x,z): This is possible. Picture x and z as overlapping regions, with y contained in their intersection and touching both boundaries.

2. TPP(x,z): This is possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then y can touch the boundary of x where x touches the boundary of z, satisfying our conditions.

3. NTPP(x,z): This is impossible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (being inside x) could not touch z's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,z).

4. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of x, then y would also touch the boundary of x.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This is impossible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (being inside z) could not touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

6. EQ(x,z): This is possible. If x and z are the same region, then y would be a tangential proper part of both.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
