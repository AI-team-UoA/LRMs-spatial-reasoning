PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We know that:
1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
2. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected, i.e., they don't share any part.

Now we need to determine what possible RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z.

Let's think about each of the 8 relations and see if they are possible:

1. DC(x,z):
This means x and z are disconnected. Given that y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is disconnected from z (from DC(y,z)), it's possible that x and z are also disconnected. For example, imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x but touching x's boundary, and z is another circle outside x and not touching x.

2. EC(x,z):
This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that x and z touch at their boundaries. Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary, and z is a circle touching x's boundary at a different point than where y touches it.

3. PO(x,z):
This means x and z partially overlap. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that parts of x that are not y could overlap with z. Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x but touching x's boundary, and z is a circle that partially overlaps with x but not with y.

4. TPP(x,z):
This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, this seems contradictory. If x is a proper part of z, then every part of x is also a part of z. But y is a part of x and is disconnected from z, which means y is not a part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
Similar to TPP, if x is a proper part of z, then every part of x is also a part of z. But y is a part of x and is disconnected from z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is also a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that z is a different proper part of x. Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary, and z is another smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary but not overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that z is a different proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary, and z is another smaller circle completely inside x without touching its boundary and not overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z):
This means x and z are the same. But if x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this reasoning.

From TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x.
From DC(y,z), we know that y and z are disconnected.

For DC(x,z): Yes, this is possible as described above.

For EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is consistent with y being a proper part of x and y being disconnected from z. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. It's consistent with y being a proper part of x and y being disconnected from z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is a proper part of z, then every part of x is also a part of z. But y is a part of x and is disconnected from z, which means y cannot be a part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, if x is a proper part of z, then every part of x is also a part of z. But y is a part of x and is disconnected from z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with y being a proper part of x and y being disconnected from z. We can have z and y as separate parts of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with y being a proper part of x and y being disconnected from z. We can have z and y as separate parts of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So my original analysis is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Let me go through each relation one more time, visualizing the regions and checking that the relations are consistent with the given constraints.

1. DC(x,z):
TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, and DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected.
If z is completely outside of x and not touching it, then DC(x,z) is satisfied and is consistent with the given constraints.

2. EC(x,z):
If z is outside of x but touching the boundary of x, then EC(x,z) is satisfied. This is consistent with the given constraints, as y can still be a proper part of x and disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z):
If z partially overlaps with x, but not with y, then PO(x,z) is satisfied and is consistent with the given constraints.

4. TPP(x,z):
This means x is a tangential proper part of z. But if x is a proper part of z, then every part of x, including y, would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
Similar to TPP, if x is a proper part of z, then every part of x, including y, would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with the given constraints, as z can be a different proper part of x than y, and y and z can be disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with the given constraints, as z can be a different proper part of x than y, and y and z can be disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z):
This means x and z are the same. But if x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This contradicts TPPi(x,y), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this one more time. Specifically, I want to make sure I'm not missing any constraints or implications.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They don't share any part.

Let's go through each relation one more time:

1. DC(x,z):
This means x and z are disconnected. We know that y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is disconnected from z (from DC(y,z)). It's possible that the rest of x (x - y) is also disconnected from z, making x disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z):
This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that the rest of x (x - y) touches z at the boundary, making x and z externally connected. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z):
This means x and z partially overlap. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that the rest of x (x - y) partially overlaps with z, making x and z partially overlapping. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z):
This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is a proper part of z, then every part of x, including y, would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
Similar to TPP, if x is a proper part of z, then every part of x, including y, would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with the given constraints, as z can be a different proper part of x than y, and y and z can be disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with the given constraints, as z can be a different proper part of x than y, and y and z can be disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
This means x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I'm still coming to the same conclusion. The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm thinking of examples for NTPPi(x,z) and I'm having a hard time creating a consistent scenario.

Let me try: 
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary
- z is another smaller circle completely inside x and not touching x's boundary

So we have TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(x,z). But are y and z disconnected? If both y and z are parts of x, it's possible that they don't overlap, making them disconnected. 

So yes, NTPPi(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary
- z is another smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, but not overlapping with y

So we have TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(x,z). And since y and z don't overlap, they are disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is also consistent with the given constraints.

I've verified all the relations, and the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I should make sure I understand the meaning of NTPPi, etc. Let's review:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary from the inside.
TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), so it means that y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary from the inside.
NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), so it means that y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.

Alright, so let's reason through the relations again:

1. DC(x,z):
This means x and z are disconnected. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that the rest of x (x - y) is also disconnected from z, making x disconnected from z. This is consistent with the given constraints.

2. EC(x,z):
This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that the rest of x (x - y) touches z at the boundary, making x and z externally connected. This is consistent with the given constraints.

3. PO(x,z):
This means x and z partially overlap. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that the rest of x (x - y) partially overlaps with z, making x and z partially overlapping. This is consistent with the given constraints.

4. TPP(x,z):
This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is a proper part of z, then every part of x, including y, would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
Similar to TPP, if x is a proper part of z, then every part of x, including y, would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with the given constraints, as z can be a different proper part of x than y, and y and z can be disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with the given constraints, as z can be a different proper part of x than y, and y and z can be disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z):
This means x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I still come to the same conclusion. The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I said that if y is a proper part of x and x = z, then y would be a proper part of z. But that's wrong. Proper parthood is irreflexive (a region is not a proper part of itself), and y would only be a part of z (not a proper part).

Let me rethink the case of EQ(x,z):
EQ(x,z) means that x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, and y is a part of x, then y would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Sorry for the confusion. The possible relationships between x and z are still: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm confused about the definition of disconnected. Let me check:

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They don't share any points, and they don't touch. They are completely separate.

Actually, let me rethink TPPi(x,z):

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is a proper part of x, which means z is completely inside x and may touch x's boundary.

If z is completely inside x, and y is also inside x (from TPPi(x,y)), then it's possible that y and z are disconnected within x. This is consistent with the given constraints.

Let me try this case by case:

From TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary from the inside.
From DC(y,z), we know that y and z are disconnected. They don't share any part and they don't touch.

1. DC(x,z):
This means x and z are disconnected. They don't share any part and they don't touch. This is possible if z is completely outside of x, away from both x and y.

2. EC(x,z):
This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if z is outside of x but touching x's boundary at a point where y is not touching x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z):
This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of z is inside x and part of z is outside x, and the part of z that is inside x does not overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z):
This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary from the inside. If x is a proper part of z, then every part of x, including y, would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
This means x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then every part of x, including y, would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary from the inside. This is possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary at a point where y is not touching x's boundary, and z does not overlap with y. Then we have TPPi(x,y), TPPi(x,z), and DC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside x, away from x's boundary, and does not overlap with y. Then we have TPPi(x,y), NTPPi(x,z), and DC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z):
This means x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, and y is a part of x, then y would also be a part of z. But y is disconnected from z, so y cannot be a part of z. This is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

The fact that I keep arriving at the same set of possible relationships increases my confidence that these are the correct answers.

So the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (share no points)

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x and z can be completely disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries at points where y isn't.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, as long as the overlapping part doesn't include y.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were part of z, then y would also be part of z (since y is part of x), which contradicts DC(y,z).
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPP.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x as long as it doesn't overlap with y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a non-tangential proper part of x as long as it doesn't overlap with y.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
