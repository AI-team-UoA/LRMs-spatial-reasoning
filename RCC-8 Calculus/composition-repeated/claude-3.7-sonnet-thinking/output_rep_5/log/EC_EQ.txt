PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are equal, meaning they occupy exactly the same region.

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, we need to understand what EQ(y,z) tells us about z in relation to y.

Since EQ(y,z), z is identical to y in terms of spatial extent. This means that:
- z has the same boundary as y
- z has the same interior as y
- z has the same exterior as y

Given that EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't share interior points with y.

Since z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), the relationship between x and z must be the same as the relationship between x and y.

Therefore, if EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

To verify this:
- x touches y's boundary, and z has the same boundary as y, so x touches z's boundary.
- x doesn't share interior points with y, and z has the same interior as y, so x doesn't share interior points with z.

This matches the definition of EC, so EC(x,z) is the answer.

Actually, let me double-check this. The RCC-8 relations are sometimes represented as a composition table that shows the possible relations between x and z given relations between x and y and y and z.

For the composition of EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the result should be EC(x,z) because EQ represents identity, so the relation between x and z must be the same as the relation between x and y.

So my answer is that if EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what happens when we combine EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are spatially identical (same boundaries, same interior)

Since y and z are identical (EQ relationship), z has exactly the same spatial properties as y. This means that whatever relationship x has with y, x must have the same relationship with z.

Therefore, if x is externally connected to y, and z is identical to y, then x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
