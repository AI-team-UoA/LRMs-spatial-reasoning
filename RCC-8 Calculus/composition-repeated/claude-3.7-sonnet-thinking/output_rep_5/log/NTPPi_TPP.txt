PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y), which means that y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z), which means that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about what NTPPi(x,y) tells us:
- y is properly contained within x (y is a proper part of x)
- y does not touch x's boundary (i.e., y is completely in the interior of x)

And TPP(y,z) tells us:
- y is properly contained within z (y is a proper part of z)
- y touches z's boundary (i.e., y reaches all the way to z's boundary at some point)

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z.

First, we know that y is a proper part of both x and z. But that doesn't immediately tell us how x and z relate to each other.

Since y is completely in the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z, there must be a point on the boundary of z that is in the interior of x. This means that x and z must overlap in some way.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know they must overlap because y is a part of both, so this is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z only touch at their boundaries. But we know that y is part of both x and z, so they must overlap, not just touch. So this is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. This is not possible because we know y touches z's boundary, and y is contained within x, so x must also touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This is not possible because y touches z's boundary, and y is a proper part of z, so z must touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident (identical). This is possible if x and z are the same region.

Let me reconsider this more carefully.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and is fully in the interior of x (doesn't touch x's boundary).
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's think about the constraints this places on the relationship between x and z.

Because y is a proper part of both x and z, we know that x and z must overlap.

Because y touches z's boundary but is fully in the interior of x, we know that at least part of z's boundary must be in the interior of x. This means that z is not completely outside of x, and x is not completely outside of z.

Let's reconsider each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as x and z must overlap because y is a part of both.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible, as x and z must have overlapping interiors, not just touching boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible, if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible, if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, because if y touches z's boundary and y is contained within x, then x must also touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, because y touches z's boundary, which means z touches the exterior of y, which is a part of the exterior of x (since y is in the interior of x). This means z touches x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible, if x and z are the same region.

But wait, let me think again. I think I'm making an error in my reasoning.

- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary. In other words, x completely surrounds y with some space to spare.
- TPP(y,z): This means y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

OK so y is properly contained in x and also properly contained in z. y touches the boundary of z but not the boundary of x.

So there are parts of x that are not in y, and there are parts of z that are not in y. The question is: how can x and z relate to each other?

For x and z to be DC (disconnected), they would need to be completely separate. But that's not possible because they both contain y.

For x and z to be EC (externally connected), they would need to touch only at their boundaries. But that's not possible because they both contain y, which means their interiors overlap.

For x and z to be PO (partially overlapping), they would need to overlap but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas.

For x and z to be TPP (tangential proper part), x would need to be properly contained in z and touch z's boundary. This is possible.

For x and z to be NTPP (non-tangential proper part), x would need to be properly contained in z without touching z's boundary. This is not possible, because y touches z's boundary, and y is contained within x, so x must also touch z's boundary.

For x and z to be TPPi (inverse tangential proper part), z would need to be properly contained in x and touch x's boundary. This is possible.

For x and z to be NTPPi (inverse non-tangential proper part), z would need to be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary. This is not possible because y touches z's boundary, and y is contained in z, so if z was completely in the interior of x, y wouldn't be able to touch z's boundary.

For x and z to be EQ (equal), they would need to be the same region. This is possible.

Let me verify this once more:

NTPPi(x,y) means:
- y is properly contained in x
- y does not touch x's boundary

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is properly contained in z
- y touches z's boundary

Actually, wait. Let me use a different approach. Let's create a simple scenario and see what relationships are possible.

Imagine y is a small circle. 

Given NTPPi(x,y), x is a larger circle that completely surrounds y with some space in between.

Given TPP(y,z), z is a larger shape that contains y, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, considering x and z:

1. x could be completely contained within z (and touch z's boundary): TPP(x,z).
2. x and z could partially overlap: PO(x,z).
3. z could be completely contained within x (and touch x's boundary): TPPi(x,z).
4. x and z could be the same shape: EQ(x,z).

Let me think about this more systematically. 

We have:
- y is properly contained in x, not touching x's boundary.
- y is properly contained in z, touching z's boundary.

For x and z, let's consider each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y, meaning their interiors overlap.
3. PO(x,z): Possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Since y touches z's boundary and is contained within x, x must also touch z's boundary. Therefore, x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Since y touches z's boundary, and y is contained within z, if z were completely in the interior of x, y wouldn't be able to touch z's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): Possible if x and z are the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

But actually, I realize that I'm still a bit confused about the constraints these relations place on each other. Let me approach this differently.

Let me use a concrete example. Imagine y is a small circle.

For NTPPi(x,y), x is a larger circle that completely surrounds y, with y not touching the boundary of x.

For TPP(y,z), z is a shape that contains y, and y touches the boundary of z somewhere.

Now, let's think about the possible ways x and z can relate:

1. z could be contained entirely within x. In this case, since y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within z, z would touch the interior of x. This means z could be TPPi(z,x).

2. x could be contained entirely within z. Since y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, x would also touch the boundary of z. This means x could be TPP(x,z).

3. x and z could overlap partially, with some parts of x outside z and some parts of z outside x. This would be PO(x,z).

4. x and z could be the same shape, which would be EQ(x,z).

But wait, let me think once more.

For TPP(y,z), y touches the boundary of z.
For NTPPi(x,y), y is within the interior of x.

If y touches the boundary of z, but y is within the interior of x, then the boundary of z must pass through the interior of x. This means that z cannot be completely contained within x without touching the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(z,x) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Wait a second.

Let me try to make a more precise argument.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know both x and z contain y, so their interiors must overlap. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since both contain y, their interiors overlap. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. This is certainly possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as a different shape that overlaps with x and contains y, with y touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, PO(x,z) holds.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as an even larger circle containing both x and y, with both y and x touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, TPP(x,z) holds.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z. This is not possible. If y touches the boundary of z, and y is in the interior of x, then x must also touch the boundary of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as a shape that is contained within x, contains y, and touches the boundary of x, with y touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. This is not possible. If y touches the boundary of z, then there's a point of y that's on the boundary of z. This point is also in the interior of x (because NTPPi(x,y)). But then z has a boundary point in the interior of x, which means z extends into the interior of x. But if z is NTPP to x, then z is entirely in the interior of x, which means the boundary of z is also in the interior of x. But then, the point of y that's on the boundary of z is in the interior of x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is actually possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. This is possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, and x (which is the same as z) as a larger circle containing y, with y touching the boundary of x/z. In this scenario, EQ(x,z) holds.

Hold on, I made a mistake in the analysis of NTPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider.

If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. Can these be compatible?

Yes, they can. If z is completely in the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then y would still be in the interior of x (because z is in the interior of x, and y is a part of z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

But now I realize I've been making an error. The definition of NTPP states that the object is a proper part and does not touch the boundary. It doesn't specify that the object is in the "interior." An object can be NTPP and still have parts that touch the boundary of the other object; it just can't have its own boundary touch the other object's boundary.

Actually, that's incorrect. NTPP means that the object is a proper part and is fully in the interior of the other object, not touching the boundary. So, my previous analysis was correct.

Let me re-examine the NTPPi(x,z) case. If z is fully in the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then y is also fully in the interior of x. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

No, wait. I'm still making an error. NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. This means z is completely in the interior of x.

If z is completely in the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then y is still completely in the interior of x (because the boundary of z is in the interior of x). This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is actually possible.

Wait, let me reconsider this carefully again with a more concrete way of thinking.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and is completely in the interior of x.
- TPP(y,z): This means y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the case of NTPPi(x,z), which means NTPP(z,x), which means z is a proper part of x and is completely in the interior of x.

If z is completely in the interior of x, and y is a part of z, then y is also completely in the interior of x. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

However, we also have TPP(y,z), which means y touches the boundary of z. Is this consistent with z being completely in the interior of x? Yes, it is. The boundary of z is not the same as the boundary of x. z can be completely within the interior of x, and y can still touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with TPP(y,z).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is actually possible.

OK, so let me make a definitive answer. These are the possible relations between x and z:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
4. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and is completely in the interior of x.
5. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

Actually, let me double-check this. 

For TPP(x,z), we'd have that x touches the boundary of z.

We know that y touches the boundary of z, and y is in the interior of x. But just because a part of x (namely, y) touches the boundary of z, it doesn't necessarily mean that x itself touches the boundary of z.

Actually, that's incorrect. If y touches the boundary of z, and y is a part of x, then x also touches the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z), we'd have that z touches the boundary of x. But z contains y, and y is in the interior of x. Can z still touch the boundary of x? Yes, z can extend beyond y and touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and would not touch the boundary of z. But we know that y touches the boundary of z, and y is a part of x. This means x also touches the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and would not touch the boundary of x. This is possible. z can be completely in the interior of x, and y can be a part of z, with y touching the boundary of z. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

One more check to make sure I haven't made any silly reasoning errors. I'm just going to run through this really carefully.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and is completely in the interior of x. In other words, y is contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z): This means y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. In other words, y is contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know both x and z contain y, so they must overlap. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since both contain y, their interiors overlap. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as a different shape that overlaps with x and contains y, with y touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, PO(x,z) holds.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as an even larger circle containing both x and y, with both y and x touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, TPP(x,z) holds.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z. This is not possible. If y touches the boundary of z, and y is a part of x, then x also touches the boundary of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as a shape that is contained within x, contains y, and touches the boundary of x, with y touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. This is possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, x as a very large circle containing y, and z as a medium-sized circle that contains y and is completely within the interior of x, with y touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, NTPPi(x,z) holds.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. This is possible. For example, imagine y as a small circle, and x (which is the same as z) as a larger circle containing y, with y touching the boundary of x/z. In this scenario, EQ(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I just realized there's still a potential issue with TPP(x,z). Let me reconsider.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and would touch the boundary of z. We know that y touches the boundary of z, and y is a part of x. But this doesn't guarantee that x is a proper part of z. x could be larger than z in some areas, which would make it partially overlap with z, not a proper part of z.

Actually, on reflection, TPP(x,z) is still possible. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as an even larger circle containing both x and y, with both y and x touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, TPP(x,z) holds.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

But wait, I want to be totally sure about this. Let's try one more approach to reasoning about this. Let me use the connection between binary topological relations and the 9-intersection model.

For NTPPi(x,y), we have:
- The interior of y intersects with the interior of x.
- The boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of x.
- The exterior of y intersects with the interior of x.
- The exterior of y intersects with the boundary of x.

For TPP(y,z), we have:
- The interior of y intersects with the interior of z.
- The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z.
- The exterior of y intersects with the interior of z.
- The exterior of y intersects with the boundary of z.

Now let's see what this means for the possible relationships between x and z. 

OK, I'm not that familiar with the 9-intersection model, so let me go back to a more intuitive approach. 

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and is completely in the interior of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

Let's just re-examine the possible relationships between x and z once more, considering the implications of these given relations.

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as both x and z contain y, so they must overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible, as both x and z contain y, so their interiors must overlap.

3. PO(x,z): Possible, as x and z can overlap partially, with neither being a proper part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible, as x can be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, as if y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, then x must also touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, as z can be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, as z can be a proper part of x and be completely in the interior of x. For example, if y touches the boundary of z, but both y and z are completely in the interior of x, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible, as x and z can be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, hold on. Let me reconsider the case of EQ(x,z). If x and z are the same region, then NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would mean that y is a proper part of the same region, but NTPPi says y doesn't touch the boundary, while TPP says y does touch the boundary. This is a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

No, that's a mistake. NTPPi(x,y) doesn't mean y doesn't touch the boundary of the same region as z. It means y doesn't touch the boundary of x. If x and z are the same region, then y would touch the boundary of z (which is the same as the boundary of x), contradicting NTPPi(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, wait. Let me re-examine this. If we have NTPPi(x,y), we would also have NTPPi(z,y) if z=x. But we have TPP(y,z) not NTPPi(z,y), so this is a contradiction. Therefore EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I messed this up. If we have EQ(x,z), then we have both NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). But if x=z, this would mean we have both NTPP(y,x) and TPP(y,x). Since these are distinct RCC-8 relations, this is a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me re-confirm the possible relations:

1. PO(x,z): Possible, as x and z can overlap partially, with neither being a proper part of the other.

2. TPP(x,z): Possible, as x can be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z.

3. TPPi(x,z): Possible, as z can be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x.

4. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, as z can be a proper part of x and be completely in the interior of x.

5. EQ(x,z): Not possible, as it would lead to a contradiction where y both touches and doesn't touch the boundary of the same region.

Wait, I see I keep making an error here: I'm focusing on the fact that in NTPP(y,x), y is in the interior of x, and in TPP(y,z), y touches the boundary of z, and that's all fine, but I need to also focus on the requirements on x and z.

So, let's check each case again:

1. PO(x,z): x and z overlap, and neither is a part of the other. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, it's possible for x and z to have a partial overlap. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as a shape that contains y and partially overlaps with x, with y touching the boundary of z. PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, and y touches the boundary of z, it's possible for x to also be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as an even larger shape containing both x and y, with y and x both touching the boundary of z. TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z. Given that y touches the boundary of z, and y is a part of x, x must also touch the boundary of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x, it's possible for z to be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as a shape that contains y, is contained within x, and touches the boundary of x, with y touching the boundary of z. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. Given that y is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x, it's possible for z to be a proper part of x and not touch the boundary of x. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a very large circle containing y, and z as a medium-sized circle that contains y and is completely within the interior of x, with y touching the boundary of z. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same region, then y is a proper part of the same region. But NTPPi(x,y) says y does not touch the boundary of x, while TPP(y,z) says y touches the boundary of z. If x and z are the same region, then this is a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually wait, I realize I'm overthinking this. Let me break it down with concrete examples.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. In other words, y is completely in the interior of x. Let's visualize this as y being a small circle completely contained within a larger circle x, with a gap between y and the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. Let's visualize this as y being a small circle contained within a larger shape z, with y touching the boundary of z at some point.

Now, let's check each possible relationship between x and z:

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. Can we arrange x, y, and z to satisfy this? Yes. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as a shape that contains y and partially overlaps with x, with y touching the boundary of z. PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. Can we arrange x, y, and z to satisfy this? Yes. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as an even larger shape containing both x and y, with y and x both touching the boundary of z. TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z. Can we arrange x, y, and z to satisfy this? No. If y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, then x must also touch the boundary of z. NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. Can we arrange x, y, and z to satisfy this? Yes. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle containing y, and z as a shape that contains y, is contained within x, and touches the boundary of x, with y touching the boundary of z. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. Can we arrange x, y, and z to satisfy this? Yes. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a very large circle containing y, and z as a medium-sized circle that contains y and is completely within the interior of x, with y touching the boundary of z. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. Can we arrange x, y, and z to satisfy this? No. If x and z are the same region, then y would both touch and not touch the boundary of the same region, which is a contradiction. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

7. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Can we arrange x, y, and z to satisfy this? No. Since both x and z contain y, they must overlap. DC(x,z) is not possible.

8. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap. Can we arrange x, y, and z to satisfy this? No. Since both x and z contain y, their interiors must overlap. EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me double check the case of NTPPi(x,z) again, as that might be counterintuitive.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and would not touch the boundary of x. Given that y is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x, it's possible for z to be a proper part of x and not touch the boundary of x. Imagine y as a small circle, x as a very large circle containing y, and z as a medium-sized circle that contains y and is completely within the interior of x, with y touching the boundary of z. In this scenario, z is completely within the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

I'm convinced my final answer is correct, but let me make one last sanity check.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. In other words, y is completely in the interior of x.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap, with neither being a part of the other. This is possible.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x. Let's think about this:
- y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.
- y is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- Can z be a proper part of x and not touch the boundary of x?

If z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x, then z is completely in the interior of x. Since y is a proper part of z, y is also completely in the interior of x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). And since y touches the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z), NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Alright, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze the constraints from the given relations.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary (y is completely in x's interior)
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y, so they must overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because both x and z contain y, so their interiors must overlap.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap with neither being a proper part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If y touches z's boundary and y is contained within x, then x must also touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would both touch and not touch the boundary of the same region, which is contradictory.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
