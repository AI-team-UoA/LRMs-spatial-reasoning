PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's break down what these relations mean:

- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is the same as TPP(z,y).

So, we have that x partially overlaps with y, and y is a tangential proper part of z.

Let's think about what this means geometrically:
- x and y share some space, but each also has some space that the other doesn't have.
- y is fully inside z, but touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider what the relationship between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   If x and y share some space (due to PO(x,y)), and y is fully inside z (due to TPPi(y,z)), then x and z must share at least that space that x shares with y. So, x and z cannot be disconnected. DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary:
   If x and y share some interior part (due to PO(x,y)), and y is fully inside z (due to TPPi(y,z)), then x and z must share at least some interior part. So, they can't just touch at a boundary. EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This seems possible. Since x and y share some space, and y is inside z, x and z also share that space. But x could have parts outside z, and z definitely has parts outside x (since y is a proper part of z and there's space in z outside y).

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is also possible. If the part of x that is outside y is still inside z, and x touches the boundary of z, then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   Similar to the above, if all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   If z is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x, this would be the case. But this doesn't seem consistent with the given information, as y is inside z, and x and y share parts, but also have non-shared parts. So, it's unlikely that z is inside x. TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   Following the same logic as above, this doesn't seem consistent with the given information. NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This doesn't seem possible based on the given information, because y is a proper part of z, and x and y share parts but are not equal. So, x and z can't be equal.

Actually, let me re-examine TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that y is inside z (TPPi(y,z) means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z), and we know that x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)). So, there's a part of y that is outside x. But this part of y is inside z (since y is inside z). So, there's a part of z that is outside x, which contradicts the assumption that z is inside x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible because it would imply that z is fully inside x, which contradicts the fact that there's a part of y that is outside x but inside z.

So, my conclusion is that only PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, let me sanity check my reasoning. I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(y,z): y is contained in z, touches the boundary of z, and is not equal to z.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z don't share any space. But x shares some space with y, and y is inside z, so x and z must share at least that space. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. But as argued above, x and z must share some interior part due to the partial overlap of x and y, and y being inside z. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some space, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. x and y share some space, and y is inside z, so x and z share that space. But x could have parts outside z, and z certainly has parts outside x, so they partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, touches the boundary of z, and is not equal to z. This is possible. If x is positioned such that all of it is inside z and it touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) would be true.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, doesn't touch the boundary of z, and is not equal to z. This is also possible, following the same logic as above, but with x not touching the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and is not equal to x. Let me think... we know y is inside z, and x and y share some space, but y also has space outside x. That means z, which contains y, must have parts outside x. So, z can't be inside x. TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this would mean z is inside x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, and is not equal to x. Following the same logic as above, z can't be inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But y is inside z, and x and y partially overlap, which means x and y are not equal. If x and z were equal, then x and y would have the same relationship as z and y, which is TPP(y,z) or TPPi(y,z). But we're given that PO(x,y). So, x and z can't be equal. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, my conclusion remains: the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But wait, I might not be considering all scenarios properly. Let me sketch out different geometric scenarios to be sure.

If TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

If PO(x,y), then x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other.

Now, let's see where x can be in relation to z:

- x can have parts outside z, in which case PO(x,z) would be true.
- x can be entirely inside z and touch the boundary of z, in which case TPP(x,z) would be true.
- x can be entirely inside z but not touch the boundary, in which case NTPP(x,z) would be true.

The other options don't seem feasible given the constraints.

Actually, I'm also realizing there's a fourth option: if z is entirely contained in x and touches the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) is true. But this doesn't seem consistent with PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), since this would mean z is inside x but y, which is inside z, has parts outside x. There's a contradiction here.

Similarly, if z is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) is true. But this leads to the same contradiction.

So, my final answer is: the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, I realize I still don't feel comfortable with ruling out TPPi(x,z). Let me try to come up with a concrete example to show it's contradictory.

Let's say we have:
- y is a small circle inside a larger circle z, touching the boundary of z. (TPPi(y,z))
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with y, with some part of x inside y and some part outside y. (PO(x,y))

Now, I want to check if TPPi(x,z) is possible, which would mean z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

But if z is inside x, and y is inside z, then y would be entirely inside x. But that contradicts PO(x,y), which says x and y have partial overlap. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

The same logic applies to NTPPi(x,z).

So, I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I'm confused. Let me step back and make sure my initial premises are correct:

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. No wait that doesn't seem right. It would be the inverse of TPP(y,z). So maybe TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y?

Let me check this carefully.

TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), meaning that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y, touching the boundary of y.

With this revised understanding:

PO(x,y) means x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other.
TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Now, let's see what the relationship between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any space. Since x and y share some space, and z is inside y, it's possible that x and z don't share any space. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is also possible. Imagine z touching the boundary of y at the same point where x touches y. Then x and z would touch at that point but not share any interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some space, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. Imagine z partially overlapping with the part of x that's inside y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, touches the boundary of z, and is not equal to z. But z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)). So, x can't be fully contained in z. TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this means x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Following the same logic as above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and is not equal to x. This is possible. Imagine z being completely inside the part of x that's inside y, and touching the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, and is not equal to x. This is possible. Imagine z being completely inside the part of x that's inside y, and not touching the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)). So, x and z can't be equal. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, with this revised understanding, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me sanity check my understanding by revisiting the problem statement again. From the problem statement: "TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)". So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, let's again analyze the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

PO(x,y) means x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other.
TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Now, let's see what the relationship between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any space. Since x and y share some space, and z is inside y, it's possible that z is completely inside the part of y that's not shared with x. In that case, x and z wouldn't share any space. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible. Imagine z touching the boundary of y at the same point where x touches y from the outside. Then x and z would touch at that point but not share any interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some space, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. Imagine z partially overlapping with the part of x that's inside y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, touches the boundary of z, and is not equal to z. Since z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)), x can't be fully contained in z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this means x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Following the same logic as above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and is not equal to x. This is possible. Imagine z being completely inside the part of x that's inside y, and touching the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, and is not equal to x. This is possible. Imagine z being completely inside the part of x that's inside y, and not touching the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)). So, x and z can't be equal. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I feel like I'm missing something. Let me draw a more concrete example again.

Let's say y is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y. That gives us TPPi(y,z).

Now, x could be a circle that partially overlaps with y. This gives us PO(x,y).

Depending on where x is in relation to y, the relationship between x and z can vary:

1. If x and z don't share any space, then DC(x,z) is true.
2. If x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts, then EC(x,z) is true.
3. If x and z share some space, but neither is contained in the other, then PO(x,z) is true.
4. If z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and is not equal to x, then TPPi(x,z) is true.
5. If z is inside x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, and is not equal to x, then NTPPi(x,z) is true.

The other options (TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z)) don't seem feasible given the constraints.

Alright, so my conclusion is: the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually let me try yet another approach. I'll take a set theoretic approach and try to derive the possible relationships.

Given:
PO(x,y): x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other.
TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Let's represent these conditions as set relations:
PO(x,y) means x ∩ y ≠ ∅, x \ y ≠ ∅, and y \ x ≠ ∅.
TPPi(y,z) means z ⊂ y, z ≠ y, and z touches the boundary of y.

Now, the relationship between x and z depends on how x and z are positioned in relation to each other.

1. DC(x,z): x ∩ z = ∅. This is possible. Consider a case where x ∩ y does not intersect with z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible. Consider a case where x and z both touch the boundary of y at the same point.

3. PO(x,z): x ∩ z ≠ ∅, x \ z ≠ ∅, and z \ x ≠ ∅. This is possible. Consider a case where x ∩ y partially overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x touches the boundary of z. This seems contradictory to the given conditions. If z ⊂ y and x ⊄ y (due to PO(x,y)), then x ⊄ z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Following the same logic as above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z touches the boundary of x. This is possible. Consider a case where z is completely inside the part of x that's inside y, and touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible. Consider a case where z is completely inside the part of x that's inside y, and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x = z. Given that z ⊂ y and x ⊄ y (due to PO(x,y)), x and z can't be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm confused about my reasoning now. Let me take a very careful approach.

Given:
PO(x,y): x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other.
TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP(y,z). It means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Let's think of these as regions. For a region to be a tangential proper part of another, it must be fully inside the other and touch the boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any space. Given that z is inside y and x partially overlaps with y, this is possible if z is inside the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Since z touches the boundary of y, and x partially overlaps with y, there could be scenarios where x and z touch at a boundary. For instance, if z touches the boundary of y at a point where x also touches y.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some space, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z partially overlaps with the part of x that's inside y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, touches the boundary of z, and is not equal to z. Since z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)), x can't be fully contained in z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, doesn't touch the boundary of z, and is not equal to z. Following the same logic as above, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and is not equal to x. This is possible if z is inside the part of x that's inside y, and touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, and is not equal to x. This is possible if z is inside the part of x that's inside y, and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. Given that z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)), x and z can't be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, my conclusion is that the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm starting to think I might be overthinking this. Let me just put together a concrete example to understand the constraints.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Let's consider a concrete example:
- Let y be the closed disk with center at the origin and radius 2.
- Let z be the closed disk with center at (1, 0) and radius 1. Clearly, z is inside y and touches the boundary of y, so TPPi(y,z) holds.
- Let x be the closed disk with center at (-1, 0) and radius 1.5. x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other, so PO(x,y) holds.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

The center of x is at (-1, 0), and its radius is 1.5.
The center of z is at (1, 0), and its radius is 1.

The distance between the centers is 2. For x and z to have a non-empty intersection, the sum of their radii should be at least the distance between their centers. The sum of their radii is 1.5 + 1 = 2.5, which is greater than the distance of 2. So, x and z do have a non-empty intersection.

But is x contained in z or z contained in x? 

To be contained, one disk must be inside the other. The distance between the centers is 2. For x to be inside z, the distance between the centers plus the radius of x should be at most the radius of z. That's 2 + 1.5 = 3.5, which is greater than the radius of z, which is 1. So, x is not inside z.

For z to be inside x, the distance between the centers plus the radius of z should be at most the radius of x. That's 2 + 1 = 3, which is greater than the radius of x, which is 1.5. So, z is not inside x.

Since neither is inside the other, but they have a non-empty intersection, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z) (partial overlap).

Hmm, maybe there are other examples I could construct. Let me try to come up with examples for other spatial relations.

For DC(x,z):
- Let y be the closed disk with center at the origin and radius 2.
- Let z be the closed disk with center at (1, 0) and radius 1. TPPi(y,z) holds.
- Let x be the closed disk with center at (-3, 0) and radius 1. x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other, so PO(x,y) holds.

The distance between the centers of x and z is 4, which is greater than the sum of their radii, which is 2. So, x and z don't share any space, and DC(x,z) holds.

For EC(x,z):
- Let y be the closed disk with center at the origin and radius 2.
- Let z be the closed disk with center at (1, 0) and radius 1. TPPi(y,z) holds.
- Let x be the closed disk with center at (-2, 0) and radius 1. x and y share some space, but neither is contained in the other, so PO(x,y) holds.

The distance between the centers of x and z is 3, which is equal to the sum of their radii. So, x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts, and EC(x,z) holds.

For TPPi(x,z):
It's hard to construct a concrete example with disks for this, because if x and y have a partial overlap, and z is inside y, it's challenging for z to be inside x. Let me take a different approach.

Let's use rectangular shapes instead of disks to make it easier to visualize.

For TPPi(x,z):
- Let y be the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,4), and (0,4).
- Let z be the rectangle with corners at (1,1), (3,1), (3,3), and (1,3). z is inside y, and its boundary touches the boundary of y nowhere, so TPPi(y,z) holds.
- Let x be the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), and (0,2). x and y have a partial overlap, so PO(x,y) holds.

But wait, actually I've got the constraint wrong. TPPi(y,z) doesn't mean z is inside y. It means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is fully inside y and touches y's boundary at some point.

So, let's revise our rectangular shapes:
- Let y be the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,4), and (0,4).
- Let z be the rectangle with corners at (1,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (1,2). z is inside y, and its boundary touches the boundary of y, so TPPi(y,z) holds.
- Let x be the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), and (0,2). x and y have a partial overlap, so PO(x,y) holds.

Wait, actually I think I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let's go back to the problem statement:

TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Actually, wait. I think I'm getting confused again. Let me just directly use the problem statement's definition:

TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Ok, so it means z is inside y (or is a part of y) and touches y's boundary. Let's go with that.

So in the above rectangular example, I had y as the bigger rectangle, z as a smaller rectangle inside y that touches y's boundary, and x as another rectangle that partially overlaps with y.

In this case, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z), because they share some space (the overlap area), but neither is contained in the other.

But again, I should be able to find examples for the other spatial relations. Let's try to construct an example for TPPi(x,z):

- Let y be the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,4), and (0,4).
- Let z be the rectangle with corners at (1,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (1,2). z is inside y, and its boundary touches the boundary of y, so TPPi(y,z) holds.
- Let x be the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (0,1). x and y have a partial overlap, so PO(x,y) holds.

Now, the relationship between x and z is...

Actually, let's carefully check if that's really PO(x,y). x is the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (0,1). y is the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,4), and (0,4). x is actually a subset of y, so the relation is TPP(x,y) or NTPP(x,y), not PO(x,y).

Let me revise this example.

I'm having a hard time finding a simple geometrical example for TPPi(x,z). Let's approach this logically.

For TPPi(x,z), we need z to be inside x and touch the boundary of x. Given that z is inside y and touches the boundary of y, and x partially overlaps with y, this can happen if z is inside the part of y that overlaps with x, and touches the boundary of x.

Actually, let's use a more irregular shape for y to make the visualization easier.

For TPPi(x,z):
- Let y be an L-shaped region, like the letter "L".
- Let z be a small rectangle inside the upper arm of the L, touching the top boundary of the L.
- Let x be a rectangle that covers the upper arm of the L, but not the lower arm. x partially overlaps with y, so PO(x,y) holds.

In this case, z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, so TPPi(x,z) holds.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- Let y be an L-shaped region, like the letter "L".
- Let z be a small rectangle inside the upper arm of the L, but not touching any boundary of the L.
- Let x be a rectangle that covers the upper arm of the L, but not the lower arm. x partially overlaps with y, so PO(x,y) holds.

In this case, z is inside x but doesn't touch the boundary of x, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me just double-check this by drawing out concrete examples for each of these relations:

For DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
- y is the plane, specifically the first quadrant (all points where x, y ≥ 0).
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a small disc centered at (0, 3) with radius 1. (PO(x,y) holds)

The distance between the centers of x and z is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16, which is greater than the sum of their radii, which is 0.5 + 1 = 1.5. So, x and z don't share any space, and DC(x,z) holds.

For EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary:
- y is the plane, specifically the first quadrant (all points where x, y ≥ 0).
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a small disc centered at (0, 2) with radius 1.5. (PO(x,y) holds)

The distance between the centers of x and z is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.24, which is approximately equal to the sum of their radii, which is 0.5 + 1.5 = 2. So, x and z touch at a boundary, and EC(x,z) holds.

For PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
- y is the plane, specifically the first quadrant (all points where x, y ≥ 0).
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a small disc centered at (0, 0.5) with radius 1. (PO(x,y) holds)

The distance between the centers of x and z is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-0.5)^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.25) ≈ 1.12, which is less than the sum of their radii, which is 0.5 + 1 = 1.5, but greater than the absolute difference of their radii, which is |0.5 - 1| = 0.5. So, x and z partially overlap, and PO(x,z) holds.

For TPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and touches x's boundary:
- y is the plane, specifically the first quadrant (all points where x, y ≥ 0).
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 1. (PO(x,y) holds)

The distance between the centers of x and z is 0, and the radius of z (0.5) is less than the radius of x (1). The sum of the distance and the radius of z equals the radius of x (0 + 0.5 = 1), which means z touches the boundary of x. So, z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and TPPi(x,z) holds.

Wait, that doesn't actually satisfy PO(x,y), because x is entirely inside the first quadrant, which is y. Let me revise this.

For TPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and touches x's boundary:
- y is the plane, specifically the first quadrant (all points where x, y ≥ 0).
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 1.5. (PO(x,y) holds)

The distance between the centers of x and z is 1, which is less than the radius of x, which is 1.5. The sum of the distance and the radius of z equals the radius of x (1 + 0.5 = 1.5), which means z touches the boundary of x. So, z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and TPPi(x,z) holds.

For NTPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary:
- y is the plane, specifically the first quadrant (all points where x, y ≥ 0).
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 2. (PO(x,y) holds)

The distance between the centers of x and z is 1, which is less than the radius of x, which is 2. The sum of the distance and the radius of z is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, which is less than the radius of x, which is 2. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, it looks like the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me actually double-check that my "PO(x,y)" examples are correct.

The revised TPPi(x,z) example:
- y is the plane, specifically the first quadrant (all points where x, y ≥ 0).
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 1.5. (PO(x,y) holds)

Is PO(x,y) correct? x is a disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 1.5, which covers the first quadrant, which is y. That would mean the relation is TPPi(x,y), not PO(x,y).

Actually, let me use different shapes:

For TPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and touches x's boundary:
- y is the disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 2.
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (-1, 0) with radius 2. (PO(x,y) holds)

The distance between the centers of x and z is 2, which is equal to the radius of x. The sum of the distance and the radius of z is 2 + 0.5 = 2.5, which is greater than the radius of x. This means z is not inside x, which is a contradiction.

Let me revise again.

For TPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and touches x's boundary:
- y is the disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 2.
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (0.5, 0) with radius 1. (PO(x,y) holds)

The distance between the centers of x and z is 0.5. The radius of x is 1. The sum of the distance and the radius of z is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is equal to the radius of x. This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) holds.

Let's also verify PO(x,y): The distance between the centers of x and y is 0.5. The radii are 1 and 2, respectively. The sum of the radii is 3, which is greater than the distance between the centers. The absolute difference of the radii is 1, which is greater than the distance between the centers. This suggests that one disc is inside the other, which would not be PO(x,y).

Ugh, I'm confused.

Okay I think I misremembered how to check for partial overlap. Let me go back to basics.

For two discs to partially overlap, the distance between their centers should be:
1. Less than the sum of their radii (otherwise, they would be separate).
2. Greater than the absolute difference of their radii (otherwise, one would be inside the other).

So, for PO(x,y):
- The distance between the centers of x and y is 0.5.
- The radii of x and y are 1 and 2, respectively.
- The sum of the radii is 1 + 2 = 3, which is greater than the distance of 0.5. Condition 1 is satisfied.
- The absolute difference of the radii is |1 - 2| = 1, which is greater than the distance of 0.5. Condition 2 is not satisfied.

So, PO(x,y) doesn't hold for this configuration.

Let me revise again.

For TPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and touches x's boundary:
- y is the disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 2.
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (-1, 0) with radius 1.5. (PO(x,y) holds)

Let's verify TPPi(y,z):
- The distance between the centers of y and z is 1.
- The radii of y and z are 2 and 0.5, respectively.
- For z to be inside y, the distance between the centers plus the radius of z should be at most the radius of y. That's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, which is less than the radius of y, which is 2. So, z is inside y.
- For z to touch the boundary of y, the distance between the centers plus the radius of z should be equal to the radius of y. That's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, which is not equal to the radius of y, which is 2. So, z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

This is wrong; TPPi(y,z) doesn't hold. Let me revise.

For TPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and touches x's boundary:
- y is the disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 2.
- z is a small disc centered at (1.5, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (-0.5, 0) with radius 2. (PO(x,y) holds)

Let's verify TPPi(y,z):
- The distance between the centers of y and z is 1.5.
- The radii of y and z are 2 and 0.5, respectively.
- For z to be inside y, the distance between the centers plus the radius of z should be at most the radius of y. That's 1.5 + 0.5 = 2, which is equal to the radius of y, which is 2. So, z is inside y and touches the boundary of y. TPPi(y,z) holds.

Let's verify PO(x,y):
- The distance between the centers of x and y is 0.5.
- The radii of x and y are 2 and 2, respectively.
- The sum of the radii is 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than the distance of 0.5. Condition 1 is satisfied.
- The absolute difference of the radii is |2 - 2| = 0, which is less than the distance of 0.5. Condition 2 is satisfied.

So, PO(x,y) holds.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:
- The distance between the centers of x and z is 2.
- The radii of x and z are 2 and 0.5, respectively.
- The sum of the radii is 2 + 0.5 = 2.5, which is greater than the distance of 2. Condition 1 for overlap is satisfied.
- The absolute difference of the radii is |2 - 0.5| = 1.5, which is less than the distance of 2. Condition 2 for partial overlap is satisfied.

So, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z), not TPPi(x,z).

Let me try one more configuration:

For TPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and touches x's boundary:
- y is the disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 2.
- z is a small disc centered at (1.5, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 1. (PO(x,y) holds)

Let's verify TPPi(y,z):
- The distance between the centers of y and z is 1.5.
- The radii of y and z are 2 and 0.5, respectively.
- For z to be inside y, the distance between the centers plus the radius of z should be at most the radius of y. That's 1.5 + 0.5 = 2, which is equal to the radius of y, which is 2. So, z is inside y and touches the boundary of y. TPPi(y,z) holds.

Let's verify PO(x,y):
- The distance between the centers of x and y is 1.
- The radii of x and y are 1 and 2, respectively.
- The sum of the radii is 1 + 2 = 3, which is greater than the distance of 1. Condition 1 is satisfied.
- The absolute difference of the radii is |1 - 2| = 1, which is equal to the distance of 1. Condition 2 is just barely satisfied.

So, PO(x,y) holds, though it's a borderline case.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:
- The distance between the centers of x and z is 0.5.
- The radii of x and z are 1 and 0.5, respectively.
- For z to be inside x, the distance between the centers plus the radius of z should be at most the radius of x. That's 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is equal to the radius of x, which is 1. So, z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. TPPi(x,z) holds.

Ah, finally! So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Now, let's try to find an example for NTPPi(x,z):

For NTPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary:
- y is the disc centered at (0, 0) with radius 2.
- z is a small disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 0.5. (TPPi(y,z) holds)
- x is a disc centered at (1, 0) with radius 1.1. (PO(x,y) holds)

Let's verify TPPi(y,z):
- The distance between the centers of y and z is 1.
- The radii of y and z are 2 and 0.5, respectively.
- For z to be inside y, the distance between the centers plus the radius of z should be at most the radius of y. That's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, which is less than the radius of y, which is 2. So, z is inside y.
- For z to touch the boundary of y, the distance between the centers plus the radius of z should be equal to the radius of y. That's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, which is not equal to the radius of y, which is 2. So, z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

This is wrong; TPPi(y,z) doesn't hold.

Hmm I'm having a hard time finding a clean example for all the relationships. 

But I'm confident about my analysis that the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me provide one more example for NTPPi(x,z). Actually, let's use non-disc shapes to make it easier.

For NTPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary:
- y is a square with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,4), and (0,4).
- z is a square with corners at (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (3,4). z is inside y and touches the boundary of y, so TPPi(y,z) holds.
- x is a square with corners at (2,2), (5,2), (5,5), and (2,5). x and y have a partial overlap, so PO(x,y) holds.

In this case, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

Actually wait. In this example, z is touching x's boundary, since they share the point (4,4). So it's actually TPPi(x,z), not NTPPi(x,z).

Let me try another example:

For NTPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary:
- y is a square with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,4), and (0,4).
- z is a square with corners at (3,3), (3.5,3), (3.5,3.5), and (3,3.5). z is inside y and touches the boundary of y, so TPPi(y,z) holds.
- x is a square with corners at (2,2), (5,2), (5,5), and (2,5). x and y have a partial overlap, so PO(x,y) holds.

Hmm, but that doesn't satisfy TPPi(y,z) because z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Let me try again:

For NTPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary:
- y is a square with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,4), and (0,4).
- z is a square with corners at (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (3,1). z is inside y and touches the boundary of y, so TPPi(y,z) holds.
- x is a square with corners at (2,-1), (5,-1), (5,2), and (2,2). x and y have a partial overlap, so PO(x,y) holds.

In this case, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I've spent quite a bit of time on this, and I'm fairly confident in my reasoning. Let me just double-check one more time.

Given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z don't share any space.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,z): x and z share some space, but neither is contained in the other.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and is not equal to x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, and is not equal to x.

The relationships TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because they would require x to be inside or equal to z, which is inconsistent with the given constraints, because z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)).

So, the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me understand what these relations mean:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some space, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP(y,z), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if z is inside the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Possible if z touches the boundary of y at a point where x also touches y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if z partially overlaps with the part of x that's inside y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)), so x cannot be fully contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is completely inside the part of x that's inside y and touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z is completely inside the part of x that's inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y, and x is not fully contained in y (due to PO(x,y)), so x and z cannot be equal.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
