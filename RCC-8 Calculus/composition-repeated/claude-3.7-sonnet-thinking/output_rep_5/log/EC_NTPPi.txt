PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. 

We're given two relationships:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share interior parts.
2. NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

I need to figure out what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

Given that EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.
Given that NTPP(z,y), z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary).

So now, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since x touches only the boundary of y, and z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), x and z cannot be touching or overlapping. They must be disconnected.

The only possible relationship would be DC(x,z), meaning x and z are disconnected.

Let me double-check this reasoning by thinking about specific examples:

- Imagine y as a circle.
- x is another shape that touches the boundary of y at a point or along a segment, but doesn't overlap with the interior of y.
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

In this scenario, x and z don't touch or overlap. They're disconnected.

I think the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider this carefully. The relationships in RCC-8 can sometimes be more nuanced.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundary but don't share interior.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, about the relationship between x and z:

Given that z is entirely within y and not touching y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z cannot be touching or overlapping. They are spatially separated.

So, I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let's double-check by ruling out all other possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

- EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary and x only touches y's boundary, x and z cannot touch.
- PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since x doesn't enter the interior of y at all, and z is entirely within y, they can't overlap.
- TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since x is outside of y except at the boundary, and z is entirely within y, x cannot be part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But as explained for TPP, x can't be part of z at all.
- TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since z is entirely within y, and x doesn't enter the interior of y, z can't be part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, z can't be part of x for the same reason.
- EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. But since x only touches y's boundary and z is entirely within y, they can't be the same.

So, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, I realize I might have been overly restrictive in my thinking.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

I need to be careful about the spatial interpretation. 

Given EC(x,y), x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter the interior of y.
Given NTPP(z,y), z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

So, z is completely inside y, and x touches y from the outside. This means x and z are separated by at least the boundary of y. They can't be touching or overlapping.

Therefore, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship. But let me make sure by visualizing once more:

Imagine:
- y is a circle.
- x is a shape that touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter y's interior.
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

In this scenario, x and z are disconnected.

But wait, am I considering all cases? For NTPP(z,y), z is completely inside y. For EC(x,y), x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter the interior. The question is: can x and z have any other relationship apart from being disconnected? I'm fairly certain they can't.

Let's approach this from the perspective of the RCC-8 compositions table, which should tell us what the possible relationships are between x and z given the two constraints. 

I'll refer to what I recall from the standard composition table for RCC-8. The composition of EC and NTPPi (or EC and NTPP, but swapping the order of the terms) should result in DC.

To double-check my reasoning:
- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. Equivalently, z contains y, and y is not touching the boundary of z.

Actually, I realized a mistake in my earlier interpretation. NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. This means z is much larger than y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Let's think about this new interpretation:
- y is completely inside z (away from z's boundary).
- x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter the interior of y.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since y is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), and x touches the boundary of y, x must be inside z as well. But can x touch the boundary of z? If y is sufficiently far from the boundary of z, then x, which only touches the boundary of y, will also be away from the boundary of z. In this case, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

But if y is positioned in such a way that it's close to the boundary of z, then x, which touches the boundary of y, might also touch the boundary of z. In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z, or TPP(x,z).

However, without more constraints, I can't determine if y is close enough to the boundary of z such that x, while touching the boundary of y, also touches the boundary of z.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.

Actually, I need to be even more careful and rethink this. Let's make sure I'm understanding the relationships correctly.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y, away from the boundary of y.
EC(x,y) means x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter the interior of y.

Given these:
- z is completely inside y, away from the boundary.
- x touches the boundary of y from the outside.

Since z is away from the boundary of y, and x only touches the boundary of y from the outside, x and z cannot touch or overlap. They are disconnected.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, I need to be consistent with the notation. If NTPPi(y,z), it means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary. If EC(x,y), it means that x and y touch at the boundary, but don't share any interior.

Given these, x only touches the boundary of y, and z is completely inside y without touching its boundary. So, x and z don't share any points; they are disconnected.

Therefore, the answer is DC(x,z).

OK, let me check RCC-8 composition table once more. Specifically, what relations hold between x and z if EC(x,y) and NTPP(z,y)?

In the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of EC and NTPP is indeed DC. So my reasoning is confirmed.

Actually, let's be extremely careful here again.

We are told that EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z). I need to make sure I'm interpreting NTPPi(y, z) correctly.

NTPPi(y, z) means "y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z." This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y," or NTPP(z, y).

So, NTPP(z, y) means z is completely inside y, away from the boundary of y.
EC(x, y) means x touches the boundary of y but doesn't share any interior with y.

Given these constraints, x and z cannot touch or overlap since z is away from the boundary of y, and x only touches the boundary of y from the outside.

Therefore, the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, I realized that it's possible that I don't fully understand the meaning of NTPPi. Let me clarify what it means: 

NTPPi(y, z) is the inverse of NTPP(y, z). 

NTPP(y, z) means "y is a non-tangential proper part of z" which means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

The inverse, NTPPi(y, z), means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y" which means z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.

Given that NTPPi(y, z) means z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary) and EC(x, y) means x touches the boundary of y (but doesn't enter the interior of y), then x and z are disconnected.

Therefore, the answer is DC(x, z).

I'm now fully convinced that I understand the situation, and the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, let me just try one more time from scratch.

I'm given:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y, z): The inverse of NTPP(y, z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y without touching the boundary of y.

I need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary) and x only touches the boundary of y (without entering y's interior), x and z cannot share any points. They are spatially separated.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x, z), meaning they are disconnected.

So, the answer is DC(x, z).

Let me double-check by going through the standard composition table for RCC-8. If we have EC(x, y) and NTPP(z, y), the result is DC(x, z). This confirms my reasoning.

I'm confident that the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, I realize that the composition table is indeed useful here. It is the standard way to answer these questions. Let's consider the relation EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z).

I need to consult the RCC-8 composition table to see what relation r holds, such that EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z) together imply r(x, z).

From what I recall, the composition of EC and NTPPi yields DC. This is because, as I've argued, if x touches the boundary of y from the outside, and z is completely inside y away from the boundary, then x and z are disconnected.

So, the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, let's try to be even more rigorous by tracing through the RCC-8 composition table more carefully.

The composition of EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z) is equivalent to the composition of EC(x, y) and NTPP(z, y), where we're looking for the relation between x and z.

In the standard RCC-8 composition table, the row corresponding to EC and the column corresponding to NTPP gives the result DC.

So, the answer is DC(x, z).

Now I am fully convinced that this is the correct answer. Just let me try to visualize this once more:

Imagine:
- y is a large circle.
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- x is a shape that touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter y's interior.

In this scenario, x and z don't touch or overlap. They are disconnected.

So, the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, I'm going to try to resolve this even more systematically. 

We have:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is completely inside y away from y's boundary.

Let's reason through all the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected. This is plausible since x only touches the boundary of y from the outside, and z is completely inside y away from the boundary.

2. EC(x, z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This is not possible because z is away from the boundary of y, and x only touches the boundary of y, so x and z cannot touch.

3. PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap. This is not possible because x doesn't enter the interior of y, and z is completely inside y, so they can't overlap.

4. TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But since z is completely inside y away from the boundary, and x only touches the boundary of y, x cannot be inside z.

5. NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z away from z's boundary. But as explained for TPP, x can't be inside z at all.

6. TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since z is completely inside y and x only touches the boundary of y from the outside, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x away from x's boundary. But for the same reason as TPPi, z cannot be inside x.

8. EQ(x, z): x and z are the same. This is not possible because z is completely inside y, and x only touches the boundary of y from the outside.

So, the only plausible relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

Therefore, the answer is DC(x, z).

Great. One more check. In the RCC-8 framework, we often refer to the composition table to determine what relation holds between two regions given their relations to an intermediary region. The composition of EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z) should give the possible relations between x and z.

The composition of EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z) corresponds to the composition of EC(x, y) and NTPP(z, y) in the table.

From the RCC-8 composition table, if EC(x, y) and NTPP(z, y), then DC(x, z) holds.

So, the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, let me just double-check with one more example.

Let me visualize: 
- Imagine y as a large circle.
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- x is a shape that touches the boundary of y at a point or along a segment, but doesn't enter y's interior.

In this scenario, x and z don't touch or overlap. They are disconnected.

So, the answer is DC(x, z).

OK. So I am very confident that if EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then DC(x,z).

But as a final double-check, let me revisit the standard RCC-8 composition table. Specifically, I will try to remember what's in the composition table for EC composed with NTPPi. 

The composition of EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z) is asking: If region x externally connects to region y, and region y is a non-tangential proper part of region z, what relation holds between regions x and z?

From my understanding of the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of EC and NTPPi yields a disjunction of relations. Specifically, if EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), then either DC(x, z) or EC(x, z) or PO(x, z) or TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z).

Hmm, that doesn't align with my reasoning. Let me think about this more carefully.

Actually, I think I'm thinking about it wrong. Let's be precise here.

We have:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y, z): The inverse of NTPP, which means y contains z completely, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's consider different possible scenarios and see what relation holds between x and z:

If z is far from the boundary of y (deep inside), then x and z are disconnected, so DC(x, z).

However, if z is close to the boundary of y (though not touching it), then there's a possibility that x and z might touch or even overlap, depending on the shape and size of x. 

Actually, let me step back and be very, very systematic about this. Let's use the axiomatization of RCC-8 to guide our reasoning.

EC(x, y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This can be written as C(x, y) and not O(x, y), where C means "connects" and O means "overlaps."

NTPPi(y, z) means y contains z completely, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y. This can be written as PP(z, y) and not TPP(z, y), where PP means "proper part" and TPP means "tangential proper part."

Now, let's analyze what these mean geometrically:
- EC(x, y): x touches the boundary of y from the outside.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is completely inside y, away from the boundary of y.

Given these constraints, x and z can't touch or overlap. They are separated by at least a part of y.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

OK, I realize I've been flipping back and forth. But the latest definition of NTPPi seems like the right one. NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given EC(x, y) and NTPP(z, y):
- x touches the boundary of y from the outside.
- z is completely inside y, away from the boundary of y.

Given these, x and z are disconnected.

Therefore, the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, rather than relying on my recollection of the RCC-8 composition table, let me directly reason about the possible relations between x and z given the constraints. That's less error-prone.

We have:
- EC(x, y): x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter y's interior.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. (I will repeatedly emphasize the correct definition to myself: NTPPi(y, z) means that z is contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. It is the inverse of NTPP(z, y).)

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected. This is plausible since x only touches the boundary of y from the outside, and z is completely inside y away from the boundary. In fact, this seems to be the only valid relation based on the constraints.

2. EC(x, z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This is not possible because z is away from the boundary of y, and x only touches the boundary of y from the outside, so x and z cannot touch.

3. PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap. This is not possible because x doesn't enter the interior of y, and z is completely inside y, so they can't overlap.

4. TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But since z is completely inside y away from the boundary, and x only touches the boundary of y from the outside, x cannot be inside z.

5. NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z away from z's boundary. But as explained for TPP, x can't be inside z at all.

6. TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since z is completely inside y and x only touches the boundary of y from the outside, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x away from x's boundary. But for the same reason as TPPi, z cannot be inside x.

8. EQ(x, z): x and z are the same. This is not possible because z is completely inside y, and x only touches the boundary of y from the outside.

So, the only plausible relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

Therefore, the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, I'm going to really try to make sure I understand the definitions of the relations, to be extra careful. Let me make sure of the meaning of NTPP and its inverse:

NTPP(x, y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, away from the boundary of y.

NTPPi(x, y) is the inverse of NTPP(x, y), which means NTPP(y, x). This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, away from the boundary of x.

Now, given EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z):
- EC(x, y): x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter y's interior.
- NTPPi(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z, away from the boundary of z.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

Since y is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), and x touches the boundary of y (but doesn't enter y's interior), x must be inside z as well. But x could either touch the boundary of z or not, depending on the shapes and positions.

If x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x, z) would hold, meaning x is a tangential proper part of z.

If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x, z) would hold, meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Without more constraints, I can't determine which of the two is the case.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, wait, I need to rethink this in a slightly different way.

NTPPi(y, z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z, away from the boundary of z.

EC(x, y) means x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter y's interior.

Now, given these constraints, we need to consider all possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x could be entirely outside of z. This would mean DC(x, z).
2. x could touch the boundary of z from the outside. This would mean EC(x, z).
3. x could partially overlap with z. This would mean PO(x, z).
4. x could be inside z and touch z's boundary. This would mean TPP(x, z).
5. x could be inside z, away from z's boundary. This would mean NTPP(x, z).

Without more constraints, all of these are possible.

However, given that y is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), and x touches the boundary of y from the outside, we can further refine our possibilities.

If y is far from the boundary of z, then x, which touches the boundary of y, could still be inside z. In this case, either TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z) would hold.

If y is somewhat close to the boundary of z, then x, which touches the boundary of y, could either be inside z, touch the boundary of z, or partially overlap with z. In these cases, NTPP(x, z), TPP(x, z), PO(x, z), or EC(x, z) would hold.

If y is very close to the boundary of z, then x, which touches the boundary of y, could be outside of z. In this case, DC(x, z) would hold.

Given these scenarios, it seems like all relations between x and z are possible depending on the specific configuration of the regions. But without further constraints, we can't narrow it down further.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully.

We have:
- EC(x, y): x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter y's interior.
- NTPPi(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z, away from the boundary of z.

Let's try to understand the constraints more precisely:

From EC(x, y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This means x is outside of y, but touching y's boundary.

From NTPPi(y, z), we know that y is completely inside z, away from the boundary of z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is completely inside z, and x touches the boundary of y from the outside, x must be somewhat "near" z. But the exact relationship depends on the relative positions and shapes of these regions.

If y is close to the boundary of z, then x, which touches the boundary of y, might also touch or even cross the boundary of z. This could lead to relations like EC(x, z), PO(x, z), or even TPP(x, z) if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

On the other hand, if y is far from the boundary of z, then x, which touches the boundary of y, might be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This would give NTPP(x, z).

It's also possible that x might be completely outside of z, giving DC(x, z).

I'm not seeing a way to definitively narrow down the possibilities without more constraints. The possible relations between x and z could be any of: DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), or NTPP(x, z).

But maybe I'm missing something. Let me try a slightly different approach. Let's think about it from a set-theoretic perspective, considering the interiors and boundaries of the regions.

We have:
- EC(x, y): This means the boundaries of x and y intersect, but their interiors don't.
- NTPPi(y, z): This means the interior of y contains the interior of z, and the boundary of y doesn't intersect with the boundary of z. In other words, the closure of z is contained in the interior of y.

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y, and the closure of z is contained in the interior of y, the boundary of x cannot intersect with the closure of z.

This means x and z are disconnected, or DC(x, z).

Let me verify this reasoning with a specific example:

Imagine:
- y is a large circle.
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y, away from the boundary of y.
- x is a shape that touches the boundary of y at a point or along a segment, but doesn't enter the interior of y.

In this scenario, x and z are disconnected, giving DC(x, z).

Now, let's consider other possible configurations to see if there are other possible relations between x and z:

Can x and z touch? No, because z is completely inside the interior of y, and x only touches the boundary of y, so there's no way for x and z to touch.

Can x and z overlap? No, because z is completely inside the interior of y, and x doesn't enter the interior of y, so there's no way for x and z to overlap.

Can x be a part of z? No, because x is partially outside y, and z is completely inside y, so x cannot be a part of z.

Can z be a part of x? No, because z is completely inside the interior of y, and x doesn't enter the interior of y, so z cannot be a part of x.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

Therefore, the answer is DC(x, z).

Actually, with 8 distinct RCC-8 relations, they must be mutually exclusive. Let me double-check my definitions of the NTPPi relation:

NTPPi(y, z) means the region y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper part of z, and y does not touch the boundary of z.

Given EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z):
- EC(x, y): x touches the boundary of y but doesn't enter the interior of y.
- NTPPi(y, z): y is a proper part of z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

OK, now I'm sure of what these relations mean. Given NTPPi(y, z), the region y is entirely contained within the interior of z, without touching the boundary of z. Given EC(x, y), the region x touches the boundary of y from the outside.

Since y is within the interior of z, and x touches the boundary of y from the outside, the position of x relative to z depends on the size and shape of z compared to y.

Here are the possible scenarios:

1. If z is much larger than y, such that it extends far beyond the boundary of y, then x (which touches the boundary of y from the outside) might be completely inside the interior of z. This would give NTPP(x, z).

2. If z is larger than y but not by much, then x (which touches the boundary of y from the outside) might touch the boundary of z. This would give TPP(x, z).

3. If z is just slightly larger than y, then x (which touches the boundary of y from the outside) might partially overlap with z. This would give PO(x, z).

4. If z is very similar in size to y, then x (which touches the boundary of y from the outside) might just touch the boundary of z. This would give EC(x, z).

5. If z is smaller than y in a way that z is entirely inside y and x touches the boundary of y from the outside, then x and z are disconnected. This would give DC(x, z).

Wait, but I'm confusing myself, because NTPPi(y, z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper part of z, and y does not touch the boundary of z. But this implies that z is larger than y, not the other way around.

Let me redo the analysis:

Given NTPPi(y, z), y is entirely contained within the interior of z, without touching the boundary of z. Given EC(x, y), x touches the boundary of y from the outside.

So, z is larger than y, and y is inside the interior of z. The boundary of y is inside the interior of z.

Now, x touches the boundary of y from the outside. Since the boundary of y is inside the interior of z, x has to be inside the interior of z as well (at least partially).

However, whether x touches the boundary of z or not depends on the relative sizes and shapes of y and z. If z is much larger than y, then x might be completely inside the interior of z, giving NTPP(x, z). If z is only slightly larger than y, then x might touch the boundary of z, giving TPP(x, z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x, z) and NTPP(x, z).

Let me double-check this with examples:

Example 1:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle completely inside z, away from the boundary of z.
- x is a shape that touches the boundary of y from the outside.

In this example, if z is much larger than y, then x might be completely inside the interior of z, giving NTPP(x, z). If z is only slightly larger than y, then x might touch the boundary of z, giving TPP(x, z).

Example 2:
- z is a large square.
- y is a smaller circle completely inside z, away from the boundary of z.
- x is a shape that touches the boundary of y from the outside.

Again, if z is much larger than y, then x might be completely inside the interior of z, giving NTPP(x, z). If z is only slightly larger than y, then x might touch the boundary of z, giving TPP(x, z).

The key insights are:
1. z is larger than y, and y is inside the interior of z.
2. The boundary of y is inside the interior of z.
3. x touches the boundary of y from the outside, so x has to be inside the interior of z (at least partially).
4. Whether x touches the boundary of z or not depends on the relative sizes and shapes of y and z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x, z) and NTPP(x, z).

Hmm, but I realized that I might have been overthinking this. Let me reason about the problem more directly.

We have:
- EC(x, y): x touches the boundary of y from the outside.
- NTPPi(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside the interior of z, away from the boundary of z.

Now, let's visualize the topological configuration:

Since y is a proper part of z, z definitely covers all of y, and extends beyond it (since we're dealing with proper parthood). Particularly, since y is a non-tangential proper part of z, the entire y, including its boundary, is contained within the interior of z.

Now, x touches the boundary of y. But the boundary of y is contained within the interior of z. So, x must overlap with the interior of z at those points where it touches the boundary of y.

However, we don't know if x is entirely contained within z. Given that x only touches the boundary of y from the outside, the rest of x could either be entirely within z, or it could extend outside of z.

If x is entirely within z, then either TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z) holds, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

If x extends outside of z, then PO(x, z) holds.

There's also a special case where x is entirely outside of z except for the points where it touches the boundary of y. In this case, the boundary of z would separate the parts of x that are outside of z from the boundary of y. But since the boundary of y is inside the interior of z, the boundary of z would touch the boundary of x. In this case, EC(x, z) holds.

So, the possible relations between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, I just realized that I might have been overthinking this entirely. Let me go back to the RCC-8 composition table, because there's a standard way to compute the possible relations based on the existing constraints.

From the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of EC and NTPPi yields a disjunction of relations. Specifically, if EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), then one of the following holds: PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), or NTPP(x, z).

Let me check if this aligns with my reasoning above.

I said the possible relations are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

But I think EC(x, z) is not possible upon further reflection. Here's why: Given that the boundary of y is within the interior of z (from NTPPi(y, z)), and x touches the boundary of y (from EC(x, y)), there must be at least a portion of x that's within the interior of z. For EC(x, z) to hold, x would have to touch the boundary of z without any part of x being in the interior of z, which is not possible given the constraints.

So, the possible relations are PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z), which aligns with the composition table.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. For RCC-8 composition, there's a standard table. The composition of EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z) gives PO(x, z) or TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z).

Actually let me think step by step. The constraints are:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely within the interior of z without touching the boundary of z.

Given these, x touches the boundary of y, which is inside the interior of z. This means x definitely overlaps with the interior of z.

But the rest of x could be:
1. Partially outside of z. In this case, PO(x, z) holds.
2. Entirely inside z, touching the boundary of z. In this case, TPP(x, z) holds.
3. Entirely inside z, not touching the boundary of z. In this case, NTPP(x, z) holds.

These are the only possible configurations given the constraints. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

So my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), are PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually I'm forgetting to rule out one of the other relations, EC(x,z). Let me double-check.

For EC(x, z) to hold, x and z would need to touch at a boundary without sharing any interior parts. But given that the boundary of y is inside the interior of z, and x touches the boundary of y, x must overlap with the interior of z. So, EC(x, z) cannot hold.

Therefore, my final answer remains: the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), are PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

ANSWER:

To answer this problem, I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z given the two relations EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me identify what these given relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts
- NTPPi(y,z): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, or equivalently, y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Now, let's analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z:

Since y is completely contained within the interior of z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches only the boundary of y (from the outside), x must interact with z in one of these ways:

1. x could partially overlap with z (where it touches y's boundary and possibly beyond)
2. x could be completely inside z but touch z's boundary
3. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary

These three possibilities correspond exactly to:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

No other RCC-8 relations are possible in this scenario.
