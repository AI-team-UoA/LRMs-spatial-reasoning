PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through this step by step.

We have the following given information:
- NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x). In other words, y is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z), which means y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

Now I need to determine what are the possible relations between x and z. Let me reason through this carefully.

Since y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPP(y,x)), y is completely in the interior of x.

Since y and z touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), and y is completely in the interior of x, z must extend at least to the boundary of y.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
This is impossible because y touches z, and y is inside x, so z cannot be completely disconnected from x.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
This could be possible if z touches the boundary of x but doesn't penetrate into x's interior except where it touches y. Since y is in the interior of x and y touches z, z could extend from y to the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
This is possible if z partially overlaps with x. Since y is in the interior of x and y touches z, z could overlap with part of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
This means x would be a tangential proper part of z, which seems unlikely given our constraints. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is inside x away from x's boundary, then it would be difficult for y to touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part
This is impossible because if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) could not touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part
This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and also touches y (which is inside x).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part
This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is impossible because z touches y, which is in the interior of x, so z must at least reach to y.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal
This seems unlikely because y is properly inside x, and z touches y at the boundary. If x and z were equal, then z would need to contain y properly as well, which conflicts with y and z being externally connected.

Let me review my reasoning:

If NTPPi(x,y) (meaning y is properly inside x away from x's boundary) and EC(y,z) (meaning y and z touch at their boundaries):

- DC(x,z): Impossible because y touches z and y is inside x.
- EC(x,z): Possible if z extends from y to the boundary of x.
- PO(x,z): Possible if z partially overlaps with x.
- TPP(x,z): I initially thought this was unlikely, but I need to reconsider. If x is a tangential proper part of z, could y still touch z's boundary? Let me think... 

Actually, TPP(x,z) is impossible. If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, and y is properly inside x (not touching x's boundary), then y cannot touch z's boundary.

- NTPP(x,z): Impossible because y touches z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and also touches y.
- NTPPi(x,z): Impossible because z touches y, which means z extends at least to y inside x.
- EQ(x,z): Impossible because if x = z, then y could not be both properly inside x and touching z at the boundary.

Let me verify my reasoning with a different approach. We have NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

From NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is properly contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x. Visually, y is completely in the interior of x.

From EC(y,z), we know that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Visually, y and z are externally connected.

Given these constraints:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected): This is impossible because y is inside x and y touches z, so z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected): This is possible. If z only extends to touch the boundary of x, and also touches y inside x, then x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping): This is possible. If z extends into x (to touch y) but also extends outside of x, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is impossible because if y is properly inside x (away from x's boundary), it couldn't touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part): This is impossible because if x is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), then y, which is inside x, couldn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) (inverse tangential proper part): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z extends from y to the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (inverse non-tangential proper part): This would mean z is completely inside x away from x's boundary. This is impossible because if z is not touching x's boundary and is touching y, z must be completely in the interior of x. But this contradicts EC(y,z) because then y and z would have to share interior points.

8. EQ(x,z) (equal): This is impossible because y is properly inside x, but y touches z's boundary. If x and z were equal, y would have to be both properly inside z and touching z's boundary, which is contradictory.

After reviewing, I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Wait, I need to check my understanding of TPPi(x,z). This means that z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is in the interior of x and y touches z, z could indeed be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) seems possible.

Actually, I need to think more carefully about EC(y,z) in relation to NTPPi(x,y).

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is completely in the interior of x, away from x's boundary.
If EC(y,z), then z touches the boundary of y but doesn't share interior points with y.

Given these, let's reconsider the possibilities:

1. EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, they must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. But since z touches y, and y is completely in the interior of x, z must penetrate into the interior of x. So x and z must share some interior points, which contradicts the definition of EC. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

2. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since z touches y, and y is in the interior of x, z must share some interior points with x. As long as z also extends outside of x, PO(x,z) is possible.

3. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since z touches y, which is in the interior of x, and z can also extend to the boundary of x, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, I've been making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me be more careful about EC(y,z).

If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This means that any point that is both in y and in z must be on the boundary of both y and z. There are no points that are in the interior of both y and z.

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is properly inside x, away from x's boundary. This means that every point in y is also in the interior of x.

Now, let's consider what this means for the relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is impossible because y touches z, and y is inside x.

2. EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, they must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. 

Let's see: z touches y, which is completely in the interior of x. This means z extends at least to a point in the interior of x, which means x and z share interior points. This contradicts the definition of EC, so EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since z touches y, and y is in the interior of x, z must share some interior points with x. As long as z also extends outside of x, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is impossible because if y is properly inside x (away from x's boundary), and y touches z's boundary, then there's a contradiction.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is impossible because if x is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), then y, which is inside x, couldn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since z touches y, which is in the interior of x, and z can also extend to the boundary of x, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x away from x's boundary. But if z is not touching x's boundary and is touching y, then z must be in the interior of x. But this would contradict EC(y,z) because y and z would have to share interior points.

8. EQ(x,z): This is impossible because y is properly inside x, but y touches z's boundary. If x and z were equal, y would have to be both properly inside z and touching z's boundary, which is contradictory.

So, after careful reconsideration, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Wait, I've been thinking about it wrong. Let me be more precise about what EC(y,z) means. EC(y,z) means that y and z share boundary points but no interior points. This means that there are points that are on the boundary of both y and z, but there are no points that are in the interior of both y and z.

Given that y is completely in the interior of x, any point on the boundary of y is also in the interior of x. Since z touches y at the boundary, z must extend at least to the interior of x. This means that x and z share interior points.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because z touches y, which is inside x.

2. EC(x,z): I previously concluded this is impossible because x and z must share interior points. That reasoning is correct, so EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): Possible as long as z extends both into x (to touch y) and outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y is in the interior of x and y touches z, this would mean that a point in the interior of x is on the boundary of z. This seems contradictory.

Let's think about it differently. If x is a proper part of z, then every point in x is also in z. Since y is in the interior of x, y is also in z. But if y is in z and also touches the boundary of z, this seems contradictory.

Actually, no, I think I've been making a mistake. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This means that the boundary of x touches the boundary of z at some point. It doesn't mean that every point on the boundary of x is also on the boundary of z.

So, if y is in the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z, this doesn't create a contradiction for TPP(x,z). However, it does create a constraint: the part of z's boundary that y touches must also be in the interior of x.

Is this possible? If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, and y is in the interior of x and touches z's boundary, can these constraints be satisfied simultaneously?

Wait, I need to think more carefully about the topology here.

Let me reconsider:

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is properly inside x, away from x's boundary. Every point in y, including its boundary, is in the interior of x.

If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. There are points that are on the boundary of both y and z, but no points that are in the interior of both y and z.

Now, let's think about what this means for the relation between x and z:

Since y is entirely in the interior of x, and z touches the boundary of y, z must extend at least to the interior of x. This means x and z share interior points.

Given that x and z share interior points, the possible relations are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Let's consider each one:

- PO(x,z): Possible if z extends both into x (to touch y) and outside of x.
- TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Can this be consistent with y being in the interior of x and y touching z's boundary?

If x is a proper part of z, then every point in x is also in z. Since y is in the interior of x, y is contained in z. But if y is contained in z and also touches the boundary of z, this creates a constraint: the part of z's boundary that y touches must also be in the interior of x.

Is this possible? Let's say z is a circle, x is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at one point, and y is an even smaller circle inside x that doesn't touch x's boundary. Can y touch z's boundary? It seems like it can't, because the boundary of z that's accessible to y is also part of the interior of x, and the only part of z's boundary that x touches is a single point, which is also on the boundary of x.

So, TPP(x,z) seems impossible.

- NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary. But if y is in the interior of x and y touches z's boundary, this is a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since z touches y, which is in the interior of x, and z can also extend to the boundary of x, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x, away from x's boundary. If z is not touching x's boundary and is touching y, z must be in the interior of x. But this would contradict EC(y,z) because y and z would have to share interior points. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

- EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is in the interior of x and y touches the boundary of z, and x and z are the same, then y would have to be both in the interior of z and touching the boundary of z, which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

After careful consideration, I believe the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, I want to verify that TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible. The reasoning I gave is that if x is a proper part of z, y is in the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then the part of z's boundary that y touches must also be in the interior of x. I said this creates a contradiction, but I'm not sure my explanation was clear.

Let me try again. If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This means that at least one point on the boundary of x is also on the boundary of z. All other points in x, including all points in the interior of x, are contained in z. Some of these points in the interior of x may be on the boundary of z, and others may be in the interior of z.

If y is in the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then the part of z's boundary that y touches must also be in the interior of x. This is possible if z has a "hole" or a "bay" that extends into the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of this hole or bay.

Let me draw a picture to clarify:

z:
|-------------------|
|                   |
|   x:              |
|   |----------|    |
|   |          |    |
|   |   y:     |    |
|   |   |-|    |    |
|   |   | |    |    |
|   |   |-|    |    |
|   |          |    |
|   |----------|    |
|                   |
|-------------------|

In this picture, x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary (TPP(x,z)), and y is in the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPP(y,x) or NTPPi(x,y)). But y doesn't touch the boundary of z, so EC(y,z) is not satisfied.

Let's modify the picture:

z:
|----------------------|
|                      |
|   x:                 |
|   |----------|      |
|   |          |      |
|   |   y:     |      |
|   |   |-|    |      |
|   |   | |----       |
|   |   |-|            |
|   |          |       |
|   |----------|       |
|                      |
|----------------------|

In this modified picture, z has a "bay" that extends into the interior of x, and y touches the boundary of this bay. So y is in the interior of x (NTPPi(x,y)), y touches the boundary of z (part of EC(y,z)), and x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary (TPP(x,z)).

But for EC(y,z) to be fully satisfied, y and z must not share any interior points. In this picture, it seems like y and z do share interior points, which contradicts EC(y,z).

Maybe I need to modify the picture again to ensure that y and z don't share interior points:

z:
|----------------------|
|                      |
|   x:                 |
|   |----------|      |
|   |          |      |
|   |   y:     |      |
|   |   |-|    |      |
|   |   | |----.      |
|   |   |-|    .      |
|   |          |      |
|   |----------|      |
|                      |
|----------------------|

In this picture, the dotted line represents the boundary of z, which extends into the interior of x and touches the boundary of y. This way, y and z don't share interior points, so EC(y,z) is satisfied.

But now I notice another issue: if the boundary of z extends into the interior of x, then z is not a connected region, which violates a basic assumption in RCC-8. Regions are supposed to be connected.

Let me try yet another approach. What if z is a connected region that surrounds x, and has a "tentacle" that extends to touch y?

z:
|----------------------------------|
|                                  |
|         x:                       |
|         |----------|            |
|         |          |            |
|         |   y:     |            |
|         |   |-|    |            |
|    -----|---|.|    |            |
|   |     |   |-|    |            |
|    -----|          |            |
|         |----------|            |
|                                  |
|----------------------------------|

In this picture, z surrounds x and has a tentacle that extends to touch y. But this still doesn't work, because if z surrounds x, then x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

I think I've been overthinking this. Let me go back to basics. If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This means that every point in x is also in z. Since y is in x, y is also in z. But if y is in z and also touches the boundary of z, this means that y is not entirely in the interior of z, which contradicts the fact that y is a proper part of z.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let's be very precise about what EC(y,z) means. EC(y,z) means that y and z share boundary points but no interior points. This means that any point that is both in y and in z must be on the boundary of both y and z.

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is properly inside x, away from x's boundary. This means that every point in y, including its boundary, is in the interior of x.

If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This means that every point in x is also in z, and at least one point on the boundary of x is also on the boundary of z.

Given these constraints, can EC(y,z) be satisfied? Let's see. If y is in the interior of x, and x is a proper part of z, then y is contained in z. For EC(y,z) to be satisfied, y and z must share boundary points but no interior points. But if y is contained in z, then either y shares interior points with z (contradicting EC(y,z)), or y is entirely on the boundary of z (contradicting the fact that y is a proper part of z).

So, TPP(x,z) seems impossible.

Let me quickly check NTPP(x,z) as well. If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary. This means that every point in x, including its boundary, is in the interior of z. Since y is in x, y is also in the interior of z. But if y is in the interior of z, it cannot touch the boundary of z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is also impossible.

After careful reconsideration, I believe the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check these by considering concrete examples:

For PO(x,z), imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x that doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is another circle that partially overlaps with x and touches y at its boundary. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z), imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x that doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is an even smaller circle that is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and also touches the boundary of y. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

So, after careful consideration, I believe the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check once more by reasoning through some examples:

Suppose we have NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z). NTPPi(x,y) means that y is properly inside x, away from x's boundary. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

- DC(x,z): This is impossible because z touches y, and y is inside x, so z must at least touch x.

- EC(x,z): This would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But since z touches y, and y is in the interior of x, z must extend at least to the interior of x. This means x and z share interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is impossible.

- PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since z touches y, and y is in the interior of x, z must extend at least to the interior of x. As long as z also extends outside of x, PO(x,z) is possible.

- TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then every point in x is also in z. Since y is in the interior of x, y is contained in z. But if y is in z and also touches the boundary of z, this means that y is not entirely in the interior of z, which contradicts the fact that y is a proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

- NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary. Since y is in x, y is also in the interior of z. But if y is in the interior of z, it cannot touch the boundary of z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since z touches y, which is in the interior of x, and z can also extend to the boundary of x, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x, away from x's boundary. If z is not touching x's boundary and is touching y, z must be in the interior of x. But this would contradict EC(y,z) because if both y and z are in the interior of x, and they touch, they must share interior points. So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

- EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is in the interior of x and y touches the boundary of z, and x and z are the same, then y would have to be both in the interior of x and touching the boundary of x, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, I need to check my understanding of TPPi(x,z) once more. If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. If z touches y, which is in the interior of x, can z also touch the boundary of x?

Let's see: z is a connected region, and it touches both y (which is in the interior of x) and the boundary of x. This means z extends from y to the boundary of x. This is possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Actually, I still want to double-check my understanding of EC(y,z). EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This means that y and z share boundary points but no interior points.

Let's consider TPPi(x,z) once more. If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. If z touches y, which is in the interior of x, and also touches the boundary of x, this means z extends from y to the boundary of x. But is this consistent with EC(y,z)?

If z extends from y to the boundary of x, and z is a connected region, then z must overlap with the space between y and the boundary of x. This means z must share interior points with this space.

But EC(y,z) requires that y and z don't share interior points. So, z can only touch y at its boundary, not in its interior. This is consistent with z extending from the boundary of y to the boundary of x, so TPPi(x,z) is indeed a valid possibility.

Let's also double-check PO(x,z). If PO(x,z), then x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since z touches y, which is in the interior of x, z must extend at least to the interior of x. As long as z also extends outside of x, PO(x,z) is possible.

Is this consistent with EC(y,z)? If z extends into the interior of x, and y is also in the interior of x, can z touch y only at its boundary without sharing interior points with y? Yes, z can be shaped in such a way that it touches y only at y's boundary, so PO(x,z) is also a valid possibility.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

That's my final answer.

PO(x,z) or TPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Impossible because z touches y, and y is inside x, so z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z) - Impossible because z touches y, which is in the interior of x. This means z must extend into x's interior, so x and z share interior points, contradicting EC.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. z can partially overlap with x, extending both into x (to touch y at y's boundary) and outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Impossible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then y would be inside z. But then y couldn't touch z's boundary without contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Impossible. If x were completely inside z (away from z's boundary), then y would also be inside z and couldn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x that extends from y's boundary to x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Impossible. If z were completely inside x (away from x's boundary), then z touching y would mean they share interior points, contradicting EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - Impossible. If x=z, then y couldn't both be properly inside x and touch z's boundary.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
