PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. In other words, x is a non-tangential proper part of y.

2. TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y). So TPP(z,y) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary. In other words, z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now, we need to figure out what are the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's visualize this:
- x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- z is part of y, touching y's boundary

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, and they don't share any parts.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
   Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, the only way for x and z to touch is if z extends inward from y's boundary to touch x's boundary. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if z extends inward from y's boundary and overlaps with a part of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if z extends inward from y's boundary and contains x, with x touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if z extends inward from y's boundary and completely contains x, with x not touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary and x doesn't, this would mean that a part of x extends beyond z to y's boundary, which contradicts the fact that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to the previous case, this would require z to be completely inside x, without touching x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary, a part of x would have to extend to y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   For this to be true, x and z would have to be the same region. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary and z does, they can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait. Let me re-evaluate the case of TPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is completely within x, and z touches x's boundary.

Given that z touches y's boundary (from TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)), if z is inside x, then x would also have to touch y's boundary. But this contradicts NTPP(x,y), which says that x doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me also re-evaluate NTPPi(x,z):

NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is completely within x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given that z touches y's boundary (from TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)), if z is inside x, then x would also have to touch y's boundary. But this contradicts NTPP(x,y), which says that x doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful. Let's revisit the whole problem.

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.

2. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is completely inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

From these two conditions, we can say:
- x is completely inside y.
- y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

Therefore, x is also completely inside z. But does x touch z's boundary?

Since x is away from y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (TPPi(y,z)), it's not guaranteed that x touches z's boundary. In fact, given the constraints, x can be completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is definitely possible, especially if x is well within y and y touches z's boundary.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is also possible if x happens to touch z's boundary, which can happen if x is close to the part of y that touches z's boundary.

Wait, I think I'm still not getting this right. Let me visualize this more carefully:

- x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.
- y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

From this, it's clear that x is completely inside z. But can x touch z's boundary?

If y touches z's boundary at a point p, and x is away from y's boundary, then x is away from p. But y could touch z's boundary at multiple points, and if x touches y's boundary at a point q where y touches z's boundary, then x would touch z's boundary.

But wait, NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch y's boundary. So, x can't touch z's boundary at any point where y touches z's boundary.

Actually, let me simplify:

- x is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- y is properly inside z, touching z's boundary.

Since x is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside z, x must be strictly inside z. Can x touch z's boundary? The only way for x to touch z's boundary would be if it touched y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary. But x doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), so x can't touch z's boundary.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Wait, on second thought, I think there's a flaw in my reasoning. Let me try to be more precise.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

We know:
- x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

From these, we can conclude:
- x is completely inside z (since x is in y, and y is in z).

Now, can x touch z's boundary?

Let's say the boundary of y is represented as ∂y, and similarly for z. TPPi(y,z) means y touches z's boundary, so there's at least one point p such that p ∈ ∂y ∩ ∂z.

Now, NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So, x is separated from ∂y by some distance.

Given that y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some points, and x is strictly inside y (away from y's boundary), x will be strictly inside z and away from z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But let me make sure...

I'm trying to reason through this again: 

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

Let's draw this out:
```
   z
  +------------------+
  |                  |
  |    y             |
  |  +------+        |
  |  |      |        |
  |  |  x   |        |
  |  |      |        |
  |  +------+        |
  |                  |
  +------------------+
```

Here, y touches the boundary of z at some point (not shown in the ASCII art), and x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.

Given this, x is also completely inside z. But does x touch z's boundary?

No, because the only way for x to touch z's boundary would be if x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary. But x doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), so x can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I'm complicating things. Let's go back to the basics.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

Now, since x is inside y, and y is inside z, it follows that x is also inside z. In terms of RCC-8, if x is inside z, it can either be NTPP(x,z) or TPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x needs to touch z's boundary. For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x shouldn't touch z's boundary.

Let's see if x can touch z's boundary:

TPPi(y,z) means y touches z's boundary. Let's call the point where y touches z's boundary as p. So, p is on both y's boundary and z's boundary.

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y, away from y's boundary. So, x is not at point p.

For x to touch z's boundary, there has to be a point q such that q is on both x's boundary and z's boundary. But if q is on x's boundary, and x is inside y (away from y's boundary), then q is inside y. If q is also on z's boundary, and y is inside z, then q must be on y's boundary as well. But this contradicts NTPP(x,y), which says x is away from y's boundary.

Therefore, x can't touch z's boundary, and the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me verify once more using a visual. 

For x to touch z's boundary, there would need to be a point that's on both x's boundary and z's boundary. But since x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary) and y touches z's boundary at some points, any point on z's boundary that's also on y's boundary can't be on x's boundary (since x is away from y's boundary). And any point on z's boundary that's not on y's boundary can't be on x's boundary either (since x is inside y).

So, x can't touch z's boundary, which means the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I think I'm overthinking this, but I just want to be absolutely sure.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

From the first condition, we know that x is a proper subset of y, and there's some distance between x and the boundary of y.

From the second condition, we know that y is a proper subset of z, and there's at least one point where y touches the boundary of z.

From these, we can conclude that x is a proper subset of z (since x is in y, and y is in z).

Now, can x touch the boundary of z?

For x to touch the boundary of z, there would need to be a point p such that p is on both x's boundary and z's boundary. 

Let's assume such a point p exists. Since p is on x's boundary, and x is inside y (away from y's boundary), p is inside y. Since p is also on z's boundary, and y is inside z, if p is inside y, it means y must touch z's boundary at p.

So, p is on y's boundary (since y touches z's boundary at p), and p is also on x's boundary. But this contradicts NTPP(x,y), which says x is away from y's boundary.

Therefore, x can't touch z's boundary, and the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me start fresh.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

NTPP(x,y) ensures that x is completely inside y, and there's some distance between x and the boundary of y. Let's denote this distance as d(x, ∂y) > 0.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is completely inside z, and there's at least one point where y touches the boundary of z. Let's call the set of points where y touches z's boundary as P = {p | p ∈ ∂y ∩ ∂z}.

Now, can x touch the boundary of z?

For x to touch the boundary of z, there would need to be a point q such that q ∈ ∂x ∩ ∂z.

Let's assume such a point q exists. Since q is on x's boundary, and NTPP(x,y) holds, q is inside y (not on its boundary).

Since q is also on z's boundary, and TPPi(y,z) holds, if q is inside y (not on its boundary), it means z's boundary dips into y beyond the points in P.

Is this possible? Yes, z's boundary can dip into y, creating a sort of bay or inlet. In this case, x could be positioned to touch this inlet of z's boundary without touching y's boundary.

Given this, both NTPP(x,z) and TPP(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z, depending on the exact positions.

Let me visualize a concrete counterexample to my earlier reasoning. Let me try to create an ASCII art that shows TPP(x,z) is possible:

```
   z
  +---------------------+
  |                     |
  |    y                |
  |  +--------+         |
  |  |        |         |
  |  |   x    |         |
  |  |  +--+  |         |
  |  |  |  |  |         |
  |  +--+--+--+         |
  |     |                |
  +-----+----------------+
```

In this visualization, z's boundary dips into y, creating an inlet. x touches this inlet, making TPP(x,z) hold. Meanwhile, x is still inside y, away from y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y) holds. And y is inside z, touching z's boundary, so TPPi(y,z) holds.

But thinking again...this doesn't actually work. The visualization is incorrect. If x touches z's boundary, and this boundary dips into y, then it's also a boundary of y at that point. So, x would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Let me try again.

Actually, I think my original conclusion was correct. The relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). Here's why:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.
3. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is inside z.
4. For x to touch z's boundary, there would need to be a point p such that p is on both x's boundary and z's boundary.
5. If p is on x's boundary, and NTPP(x,y) holds, p is inside y (not on its boundary).
6. If p is on z's boundary, and TPPi(y,z) holds, for p to be inside y, z's boundary would have to dip into y.
7. But if z's boundary dips into y at point p, then p is also on y's boundary. And if p is on x's boundary, it means x touches y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, x can't touch z's boundary, and the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But I'm still not fully confident, so let me try to reason more carefully through the possibility of z's boundary dipping into y.

Let's say z's boundary dips into y at point p, creating an inlet. For x to touch z's boundary at p, x would need to extend to p. But if p is an inlet, it's a boundary point of y. If x extends to p, it would touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, even with the possibility of z's boundary dipping into y, x can't touch z's boundary without also touching y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

On second thought, I think I'm complicating things unnecessarily. Let's use a simpler approach.

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (so x is completely inside y).
- x doesn't touch y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (so y is completely inside z).
- y touches z's boundary.

From this, we can deduce:
- x is completely inside y, which is completely inside z, so x is completely inside z.
- x doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch y at a point where y touches z's boundary. And since z's boundary is outside of y except at points where y touches it, x can't touch z's boundary either.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating things.

Let's consider a simpler reasoning: If x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x must be "far away" from z's boundary, separated by at least the entire y region. So, x can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I just realized there's a slight issue in my explanation. While x must be separated from z's boundary at points where y doesn't touch it, it's not guaranteed to be separated from z's boundary at points where y touches it. Let me think about this more carefully.

So we have NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (so x is completely inside y).
- x doesn't touch y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (so y is completely inside z).
- y touches z's boundary at least at one point, say p.

Now, can x touch z's boundary?

For x to touch z's boundary, there would need to be a point q such that q is on both x's boundary and z's boundary. Since x is inside y, q must be inside y as well.

But z's boundary is outside of y, except at points where y touches it. So, for q to be on z's boundary, it must be at a point where y touches z's boundary. But if q is on y's boundary, and NTPP(x,y) holds, x doesn't reach q. Therefore, x can't touch z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, ok, I want to be super explicit. So we have NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). Let me try to show why the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z) by decomposing the problem:

1. First, we know that x is a proper part of y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y is a proper part of z (from TPPi(y,z)). By transitivity, x is a proper part of z. So, x is inside z, and x ≠ z.

2. For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x shouldn't touch z's boundary. Let's see if this is always the case.

3. From NTPP(x,y), we know that x doesn't touch y's boundary. So, for any point p on y's boundary, p is not on x's boundary.

4. From TPPi(y,z), we know that y touches z's boundary. So, there's at least one point p such that p is on both y's boundary and z's boundary.

5. For any point q on z's boundary, if q is not on y's boundary, then q is outside of y. Since x is inside y, x can't touch q.

6. For any point p on z's boundary that is also on y's boundary, p is not on x's boundary (from step 3). So, x doesn't touch z's boundary at any point where y touches it.

7. From steps 5 and 6, we conclude that x doesn't touch z's boundary at any point. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) holds.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So I think we've established that x NTPP z with high confidence.

But wait a minute. Let's actually look into the possibilities more systematically. We need to find all possible RCC8 relations that are consistent with NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). Some additional facts to note are:

1. If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then x ⊂ y ⊂ z. So x ⊂ z and x ≠ z. This rules out EQ(x,z), DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

2. From point 1, x is a proper part of z. So, either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) holds.

3. For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to touch z's boundary.

4. For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x shouldn't touch z's boundary.

We now understand that both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are logically consistent with NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). However, in the discussion above, I showed that x cannot touch z's boundary. Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

So I think we finally have the correct answer: The possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait a minute. When I'm looking at that final step, I realize that I didn't really settle the question with 100% confidence. Let me be sure.

I've been trying to show that TPP(x,z) is not possible, which means I'm trying to show that x can't touch z's boundary. But I'm having doubts about my previous reasoning. Let me revisit it.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to touch z's boundary at some point, say q. For this to be consistent with NTPP(x,y), q would need to be inside y (not on y's boundary).

Is it possible for z's boundary to pass through the interior of y (not just touch y's boundary)? If TPPi(y,z) holds, y touches z's boundary. But touching doesn't mean z's boundary can penetrate into y's interior. Since y is a proper part of z, z's boundary is outside of y, except at points where y touches it.

So, the only points of z's boundary that are inside or on the boundary of y are the points where y touches z's boundary. But from NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary, so x can't touch z's boundary at these points.

Therefore, x can't touch z's boundary, and the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I'm now confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me just recap:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.
- Given these, x is completely inside z (since x is in y, and y is in z).
- For x to touch z's boundary, there would need to be a point that's on both x's boundary and z's boundary. But z's boundary is outside of y, except at points where y touches it. And from NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary, so x can't touch z's boundary at these points. Therefore, x can't touch z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I just realized I might be wrong about TPP(x,z) not being possible. Let me try to come up with a specific example where TPP(x,z) holds.

Let's think of a circle inside a larger circle, which is inside an even larger circle. The smallest circle represents x, the middle circle represents y, and the largest circle represents z. Let's say y touches z's boundary at point p. Could the smallest circle (x) touch z's boundary?

Actually, no. If x touches z's boundary, since x is inside y, it would touch z's boundary at a point that's inside y. But z's boundary is outside of y, except at points where y touches it. And at these points, y's boundary also touches z's boundary. So, for x to touch z's boundary, x would have to touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, I'm back to the conclusion that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Ok, let me summarize:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

We want to know the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is inside z. This rules out DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

So, x is either TPP(z) or NTPP(z).

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to touch z's boundary. For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x shouldn't touch z's boundary.

I've argued that x can't touch z's boundary because z's boundary is outside of y, except at points where y touches it. And from NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary, so x can't touch z's boundary at these points.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me see if I can express my thinking slightly differently.

If I want TPP(x,z) to be possible, I need x to touch z's boundary. Where can x touch z's boundary? Only at places where z's boundary intersects with y. But if z's boundary intersects with y, then that's a part of y's boundary too, since y is a tangential proper part of z. If x were to touch this part of y's boundary, it would violate NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible, and the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I'm convinced that NTPP(x,z) is the only possibility now.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- TPPi(y,z) means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

From these facts:
1. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, then x must be inside z
2. This immediately rules out DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ as possible relations between x and z
3. So either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) must hold

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to touch z's boundary. But is this possible?
- Z's boundary only intersects with y at points where y touches z's boundary
- These intersection points are on y's boundary
- Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), x cannot touch these points
- Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary

Since x is properly inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
