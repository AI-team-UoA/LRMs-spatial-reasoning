PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are exactly the same region)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y))

Since TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), we know that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means that z is properly contained in y (z is a proper part of y) and z touches y's boundary.

Now, since EQ(x,y), x and y are exactly the same region. So whatever spatial relationship y has with any other region, x will have the same relationship with that region.

Since TPP(z,y), z is a tangential proper part of y, and since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), z must also be a tangential proper part of x. So TPP(z,x).

But the question asks for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. So we need to convert TPP(z,x) to a relationship between x and z.

The inverse of TPP is TPPi. So if TPP(z,x), then TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y))

Since x and y are coincident, x has the same relationship with z as y does with z.

The relationship between y and z is TPPi(y,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is also TPPi(x,z).

So my answer is that the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Hmm, let me reconsider to make sure.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (identical regions)
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), it must be the case that z is also a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)).

From the perspective of the relationship between x and z, we have TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

I'm now confident in this answer.

Actually, let me try to reason about this once more to be fully certain.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z

The second condition, TPPi(y,z), means that z is a tangential proper part of y, or TPP(z,y). This means z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Now, since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. So z is also properly contained in x and touches x's boundary, which means TPP(z,x).

From the perspective of the relationship between x and z, we have TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

I've checked this several times and I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, let me verify this one more time to be absolutely certain.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region (they coincide)
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y (z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Since x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)).

From the perspective of the relationship between x and z, we have TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

I'm now absolutely confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are exactly the same spatial region)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y))

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical regions. Whatever spatial relationship y has with z, x must have the same relationship with z.

We know that TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y - z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Since x is identical to y (from EQ(x,y)), z must also be a tangential proper part of x. This means TPP(z,x), which from x's perspective is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
