PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out the possible relationships between regions x and z, given that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's think about what these relations mean:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected. They don't share any points.

Now I need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z. Let's consider all possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected.
   Is this possible? Yes, if the part of x that overlaps with y is completely separate from z (which is disconnected from y), then x and z could be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect (touch at their boundaries).
   Is this possible? Yes, x could extend beyond y in such a way that it just touches z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap.
   Is this possible? Yes, x could extend beyond y and overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? Let's think... If x is partially overlapping with y, and y is disconnected from z, could x be contained in z and touch z's boundary? 
   Actually, this seems problematic. If x is inside z and touching z's boundary, and x also overlaps with y which is disconnected from z, then y would have to overlap with z or at least touch it. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to the TPP case, if x is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x also overlaps with y which is disconnected from z, then y would have to overlap with z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? Yes, z could be inside x and touching x's boundary, while y overlaps with x in areas where z is not.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? Yes, z could be completely inside x, away from x's boundary, while y overlaps with x in areas where z is not.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal.
   Is this possible? No, because if x equals z, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y, contradicting DC(y,z).

Let me double-check TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) with a slightly different reasoning:

For TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be contained within z. But we also know that x partially overlaps with y. This means some part of x is also part of y. If x is inside z, then that part of y that overlaps with x would also have to be inside or at least touching z. But this contradicts DC(y,z), which states that y and z are disconnected.

So I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me just verify these once more by visualizing examples:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine three separate circles where x and y overlap slightly, and z is far from both.
2. EC(x,z): Imagine x and y as overlapping circles, and z as a circle that touches x at a point but is far from y.
3. PO(x,z): Imagine x and y as overlapping circles, and z as a circle that overlaps with x in an area where y is not present.
4. TPPi(x,z): Imagine z as a small circle completely inside x, and y as a circle that overlaps with x in an area far from z.
5. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, but z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

These all seem consistent with the given constraints PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

So my final answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations could hold between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some interior points)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no points)

Analyzing each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can overlap with y in one area while being completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can overlap with y in one area while just touching z at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can overlap with y in one region and overlap with z in a different region.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible - if x were inside z while also overlapping with y, then y would need to intersect with z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - same reasoning as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a tangential proper part of x while x overlaps with y in a different region.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be completely inside x, away from its boundary, while x overlaps with y elsewhere.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x equals z, then x overlapping with y would mean z also overlaps with y, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
