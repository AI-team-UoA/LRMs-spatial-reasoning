PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- TPPi(y,z): y is the tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., TPP(z,y)

TPP(z,y) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's analyze each RCC-8 relation to see if it's possible.

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
Since x touches the boundary of y (EC(x,y)), and z is part of y and touches y's boundary (TPP(z,y)), it's possible that x and z don't share any points. For example, x could touch y at a point on y's boundary that's far from where z touches y's boundary. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z touch at their boundaries?
Since x touches the boundary of y, and z touches the boundary of y, it's possible that x and z touch at a common point on y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
This would mean x and z share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other. Since x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), and z is fully contained within y (TPP(z,y)), x and z cannot share any interior points. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
This would mean x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), and z is fully contained within y (TPP(z,y)), x cannot be fully contained in z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
This would mean x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), and z is fully contained within y (TPP(z,y)), x cannot be fully contained in z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
This would mean z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since z is part of y (TPP(z,y)), and x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), it's not possible for z to be fully contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
This would mean z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since z is part of y (TPP(z,y)), and x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), it's not possible for z to be fully contained in x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are coincident?
This would mean x and z are the same region. Since x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), and z is fully contained within y (TPP(z,y)), x and z cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning on this, because I'm not fully confident.

We know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, meaning z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., TPP(z,y)

TPP(z,y) means that z is properly contained in y (i.e., all of z is inside y, but z is not equal to y) and z touches y's boundary.

Let's verify each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary. It's possible that x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is far from where z touches y's boundary. In this case, x and z would be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z touch at their boundaries?
Since EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z touches y's boundary. It's possible that x touches y exactly at the point where z also touches y's boundary. In this case, x and z would touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
This would mean x and z share some interior points, and neither is fully contained in the other. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share any interior points with y. Since TPP(z,y), z is fully contained within y. Therefore, x and z cannot share any interior points. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
This would mean x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary and is not contained within y. Since TPP(z,y), z is properly contained within y. Therefore, x cannot be contained within z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
This would mean x is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary and is not contained within y. Since TPP(z,y), z is properly contained within y. Therefore, x cannot be contained within z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
This would mean z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is properly contained within y. Given these constraints, it's not possible for z to be contained within x because x doesn't even have interior points in y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
This would mean z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For the same reason as above, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are coincident?
This would mean x and z are the same region. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is properly contained within y. Therefore, x and z cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

Actually, there's one more relation I want to double check, the PO(x,z) case.

Actually, let me remind myself of the definitions of these RCC-8 relations:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, i.e., they share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is part of y, touches y's boundary, and is not equal to y.
NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is part of y, doesn't touch y's boundary, and is not equal to y.
TPPi(x,y): inverse of TPP, i.e., TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y): inverse of NTPP, i.e., NTPP(y,x).
EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.

Given these definitions, let's think about PO(x,z) again. For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z need to share some interior points, but neither can be fully contained in the other. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share any interior points with y. Since TPP(z,y), z is properly contained within y. Since x doesn't share any interior points with y, and z is fully contained in y, x and z cannot share any interior points. Thus, PO(x,z) is not possible.

So my conclusion remains the same: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check my understanding of TPPi(y,z). TPPi(y,z) means that y is the tangential proper part inverse of z, which is the same as TPP(z,y). So, TPP(z,y) means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Actually, I realize that I might have been confused about TPPi(y,z). Let me clarify that TPPi(y,z) means that y is the tangential proper part inverse of z, which is the same as TPP(z,y).

So, we have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPPi(y,z): y is the tangential proper part inverse of z, which means TPP(z,y)

TPP(z,y) means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, I think I've been mistaken in my interpretation. Let me get this straight:

- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(x,y) means that x is the tangential proper part inverse of y, which is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

Given this clarification, let's redo the analysis:

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y

Now, let's analyze each RCC-8 relation to see if it's possible between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary. It's possible that x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is far from where z touches y's boundary. In this case, x and z would be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z touch at their boundaries?
Since EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z touches y's boundary. It's possible that x touches y at the exact point where z also touches y's boundary. In this case, x and z would touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
This would mean x and z share some interior points, and neither is fully contained in the other. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't share any interior points with y. Since z is fully contained within y, and x doesn't have any interior points in y, x and z cannot partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
This would mean x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x only touches y at the boundary and is not contained within y. Since z is fully contained within y, x cannot be contained within z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
This would mean x is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to the reasoning above, since x is not contained within y, it cannot be contained within z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
This would mean z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since z is fully contained within y, and x only touches y at the boundary, z cannot be fully contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
This would mean z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to the reasoning above, z cannot be contained within x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are coincident?
This would mean x and z are the same region. Since x only touches y at the boundary and z is fully contained within y, they cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

I realize I was getting confused, but I've been consistent in my final answer across all my analyses: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, I realize there's another possibility I hadn't considered before: what if z is a proper subset of y, but z includes the part of y's boundary where x touches y?

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y))

In this case, if z includes the part of y's boundary where x touches y, then x would also touch z at its boundary. This confirms that EC(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

But what if z doesn't include the part of y's boundary where x touches y? In this case, x and z would be disconnected, confirming that DC(x,z) is also a possible relationship.

I'm confident in my answer now: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Wait, let me revisit the definition of TPPi one more time.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is the inverse of a tangential proper part of z. This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, given TPPi(y,z), z is a tangential proper part of y. But actually, thinking again, I realized that I've been misunderstanding TPPi. Let me revisit the definition.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is the inverse of a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is to z what z is to y in the TPP relation. So, if TPP(z,y) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, then TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z.

No, that's not right. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of this, which means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x.

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

Yes, I've got it now:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

With this understanding, let's redo the analysis:

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y))

From the previous analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points

I think I was making things more complicated than they needed to be. Let's revisit this with a clearer head. For completeness, I'll check all eight relations one more time.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's analyze each RCC-8 relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
Since EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries. Since TPPi(y,z), y is properly contained in z, which means y is a subset of z. This means that wherever y is, z is also there (plus potentially more). Since x touches y, and y is contained in z, there's a point of z (where y touches its boundary) that x also touches. So, x and z must have at least one point in common, which means they can't be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Hold on, let me think about this more carefully.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Ah, I see the confusion. Let me think step by step.

Since TPPi(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. y is a proper part of z (all of y is inside z, but y is not equal to z).
2. y touches z's boundary.

Since EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, if y is inside z and x touches y's boundary, then x might also touch z's boundary (if the part of y's boundary that x touches is also a part of z's boundary) or x might be inside z (if the part of y's boundary that x touches is inside z and not on z's boundary).

But wait, if y touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x might not necessarily touch z's boundary. It depends on where exactly y touches z's boundary and where x touches y's boundary.

Let me redraw the situation in my mind. I'll only have three possibilities.

The spatial entities involved can be imagined as regions in a 2D space:
- z is a larger region
- y is a region properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.
- x is a region outside of y but touching y's boundary.

Possibility 1: If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Possibility 2: If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not on z's boundary), then x is touching y but is also inside z. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(x,z).

But actually, for x to be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), all of x would need to be inside z, and x would need to touch z's boundary. But it's possible that x is partially outside of z, especially if x is touching y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not necessarily true for all cases.

Possibility 3: If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and the rest of x is also inside z, then TPP(x,z) is true. If part of x is outside of z, then PO(x,z) is true.

Given the constraints, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), TPP(x,z), and PO(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm introducing an error here. Let me try to think about this more simply.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Since TPPi(y,z), z is the larger region, and y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary.

Since EC(x,y), x is outside of y but touches y's boundary.

Now, where is x in relation to z?

There are three possibilities:
1. x is outside of z, touching z's boundary at the point where y also touches z's boundary. This would correspond to EC(x,z).
2. x is partially inside z, meaning x and z have some common interior points, but neither is a proper part of the other. This would correspond to PO(x,z).
3. x is fully inside z, touching z's boundary. This would correspond to TPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)

Wait, let me double-check the case where x is outside of z. Is it possible for x to be completely disconnected from z?

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Since TPPi(y,z), y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Since EC(x,y), x touches y at its boundary.

If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not on z's boundary), then x is either partially or fully inside z. This would correspond to PO(x,z) or TPP(x,z).

If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x touches z at its boundary. This would correspond to EC(x,z).

Given these constraints, it's not possible for x to be completely disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Actually, let's do this more carefully.

Recall the definition of RCC-8 relations:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, i.e., they share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is part of y, touches y's boundary, and is not equal to y.
NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is part of y, doesn't touch y's boundary, and is not equal to y.
TPPi(x,y): inverse of TPP, i.e., TPP(y,x). So y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(x,y): inverse of NTPP, i.e., NTPP(y,x). So y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.

So I have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Since TPPi(y,z), y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Since EC(x,y), x touches y at its boundary but doesn't share any interior points with y.

Now, let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
For x and z to be disconnected, they should share no spatial parts. Since EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not on z's boundary), then x is partially inside z, which means they share some spatial parts. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then x and z touch at their boundaries. Either way, x and z cannot be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me reason more precisely about this.

If y is a tangential proper part of z (TPPi(y,z)), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. This means there's at least one point p on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of z.

Now, if EC(x,y), then x touches y's boundary but doesn't share any interior points with y. There's at least one point q on the boundary of x that is also on the boundary of y.

But if q is not the same as p, i.e., if x touches y at a different point than where y touches z, then x could be completely outside of z. This would mean DC(x,z) is possible.

So, DC(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z, depending on where x touches y's boundary.

Actually, let me re-revisit my logic here.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Assuming p is the point where y touches z's boundary, and q is the point where x touches y's boundary:

If q = p, then x, y, and z all share a point on their boundaries. This would mean EC(x,z).

If q ≠ p, then there are several possibilities:
1. If q is a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary (but not p), then x, y, and z all share this point, which means EC(x,z).
2. If q is a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not on z's boundary), then x is partially inside z, which means PO(x,z).
3. If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).

It's also possible that q is a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and x is so small that it's completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This would mean NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I misunderstood the constraint EC(x,y) earlier. Let me double-check:

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. This means x is completely outside of y except for the point(s) where they touch.

Given this, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
For this to be true, x and z should share no spatial parts. If y is a tangential proper part of z, then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary, then x touches a part of z (since y is inside z). If this touch point is on z's boundary, then x and z touch. If this touch point is inside z, then x is partially inside z. Either way, x and z can't be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

But what if x is very small, touching y at a point p on y's boundary, and p is outside of z? This would mean DC(x,z).

Actually, that can't happen. If y is a tangential proper part of z, then all of y, including its boundary, is inside z, except for the points where y touches z's boundary. So, if x touches y's boundary, x is either touching z's boundary (if x touches y at a point where y touches z) or is partially inside z (if x touches y at a point inside z).

Given this, x and z can't be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Actually, I think my mental model might be wrong. Let's be more precise:

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. All of y is inside z.
2. y touches z's boundary.
3. y is not equal to z.

Now, if EC(x,y), then x touches y's boundary but doesn't share any interior points with y.

Given these constraints, there are three possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary. This would mean EC(x,z).

2. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not on z's boundary), then x is partially inside z. If the part of x that's inside z doesn't make x a proper part of z, then PO(x,z). If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z). If x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

OK, so considering the possibilities more carefully, I have:

1. EC(x,z): If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary.
2. PO(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and x is partially inside z.
3. TPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
4. NTPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let me review one more time:

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

EC(x,y) means x touches y's boundary but doesn't share any interior points with y.

Given these, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary, and that point is not on z's boundary, and no part of x is inside z. 

But wait, that doesn't make sense. If y is inside z, then any point on y's boundary is either inside z or on z's boundary. There's no way for a point on y's boundary to be outside of z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary. Then, x is touching z's boundary at that same point.

3. PO(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and a part of x is inside z, but not all of x.

4. TPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and all of x is inside z, and x also touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): If x is a region containing z. But given the constraints, x is touching y's boundary, and y is inside z. So, z can't be inside x. TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, z can't be a non-tangential proper part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region. But given the constraints, x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z. So, x and z can't be the same region. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I want to double-check the NTPP(x,z) case.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x should be a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not on z's boundary), then x could be fully inside z and not touching z's boundary. This would mean NTPP(x,z) is possible.

However, for this to happen, y should have a part of its boundary that's completely inside z. But TPPi(y,z) means y touches z's boundary, not that every point on y's boundary is on z's boundary. So, y can have parts of its boundary that are inside z, and x could touch y's boundary at one of these points. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

OK, I think we've covered all the cases. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary.
- PO(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and a part of x is inside z, but not all of x.
- TPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and all of x is inside z, and x also touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z, and all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

Actually, I think I'm being too generous with the possible relationships. Let me go back to the constraints:

EC(x,y) means x touches y's boundary but doesn't share any interior points with y.
TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these, let's think about each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): For x and z to be disconnected, they should share no spatial parts. If y is inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then x either touches z's boundary (if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary) or is partially inside z (if x touches y at a point inside z). Either way, x and z are not disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me really think about this carefully one more time.

EC(x,y) means x touches y's boundary but doesn't share any interior points with y.
TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Here's my reasoning:

1. If y is inside z and touches z's boundary, then there's at least one point p on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of z.
2. But not all points on the boundary of y are on the boundary of z; some are inside z.
3. If x touches y at a point q on y's boundary, there are two possibilities:
   a. q is on z's boundary (i.e., q = p or another point where y and z boundaries coincide).
   b. q is inside z.
4. If q is on z's boundary, then x also touches z at q, which means EC(x,z).
5. If q is inside z, then part of x is inside z.
6. If part of x is inside z, but not all of x, then PO(x,z).
7. If all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary (which is possible if x is large enough to extend from q to z's boundary), then TPP(x,z).
8. If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

Given these, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I am confident that these are all the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

Let me try to come up with a simple example for each relationship to verify:

1. EC(x,z): Imagine z as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside z, such that y touches z's boundary at one point. Now, imagine x as a circle outside of both y and z, but touching y at the exact point where y touches z's boundary. Here, x is touching both y and z at their boundaries without sharing any interior points with either. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

2. PO(x,z): Imagine z as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside z, such that y touches z's boundary at one point. Now, imagine x as a circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not where y touches z). x is partially inside z, but also extends outside of z. Here, x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

3. TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside z, such that y touches z's boundary at one point. Now, imagine x as a circle inside z that touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z. x is completely inside z and also touches z's boundary at another point. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

4. NTPP(x,z): Imagine z as a circle with y as a smaller circle inside z, such that y touches z's boundary at one point. Now, imagine x as a small circle inside z that touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z. x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

I think these examples confirm that all four relationships are possible.

Wait. Let me double-check the examples for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z), x touches y's boundary, and x is completely inside z, and x touches z's boundary. This requires that there's a point on y's boundary inside z (where x touches y), and x is large enough to extend to z's boundary. This seems possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x touches y's boundary, and x is completely inside z, but x doesn't touch z's boundary. This requires that there's a point on y's boundary inside z (where x touches y), and x is small enough not to touch z's boundary. This also seems possible.

Alright, I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let's check once more for the case of PO(x,z):

For PO(x,z), x and z should share some interior points, but neither should be a proper part of the other. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary inside z, then part of x is inside z. If x also extends outside of z, then PO(x,z) is true. But I need to ensure that the part of x inside z is an interior part, not just a boundary part. Since x touches y's boundary, and the part of y's boundary that x touches is inside z, the part of x that's inside z includes the point where x touches y. Is this point an interior point of both x and z?

Let me reason through this:

If a point p is on the boundary of y, and p is inside z (not on z's boundary), then p is an interior point of z.
If p is on the boundary of x (since x touches y's boundary at p), then p is not an interior point of x.

So, the part of x that's inside z includes a point p that's on the boundary of x, which means p is not an interior point of x. For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z should share an interior point, not just a boundary point.

But if x touches y at p, then a small part of x (not just a point) is inside z. And this small part of x includes interior points of x. So, x and z share interior points, and PO(x,z) is possible.

Let me verify the other relationships one more time:

1. EC(x,z): If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x and z touch at this point without sharing any interior points. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

2. PO(x,z): If x touches y at a point inside z, then a small part of x is inside z. If the rest of x extends outside of z, then x and z share some interior points, but neither is a proper part of the other. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

3. TPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point inside z, and all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

4. NTPP(x,z): If x touches y at a point inside z, and all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Given all this, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z, given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relationships tell us:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is contained within z and touches z's boundary

Now I'll examine each possible relationship between x and z:

1. If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x also touches z at their boundaries without sharing interior points. This gives us EC(x,z).

2. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not on z's boundary), and x extends outside of z, then x and z share some interior points but neither is contained in the other. This gives us PO(x,z).

3. If x touches y at a point inside z, and all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z. This gives us TPP(x,z).

4. If x touches y at a point inside z, and all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This gives us NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
