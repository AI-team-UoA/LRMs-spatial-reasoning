PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the relationship between x and z given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary)

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z.

Let's analyze this systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   This is possible if x does not overlap with z at all. Since y is a proper part of z and x is externally connected to y, x could be completely outside of z, only touching y at a boundary point that also happens to be on z's boundary.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   This is possible if x touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z's interior. Since y touches z's boundary (due to TPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), it's possible that x touches z's boundary precisely at the point where y also touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   This is possible if x partially overlaps with z. Since y is inside z and x touches y's boundary, x could extend both inside and outside of z, creating a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   This is possible if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a point that's also on z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   This doesn't seem possible. If EC(x,y), then x touches y's boundary. If y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), then x cannot be completely in the interior of z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This doesn't seem possible because y is a tangential proper part of z, and x only touches y's boundary. For z to be contained in x, y would also need to be contained in x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   This would mean x and z are identical. This is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x is only externally connected to y. If x were equal to z, then x would contain y, contradicting EC(x,y).

Let me double-check my reasoning.

For DC(x,z):
If x is externally connected to y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x could be outside of z completely, only touching y at a point that is also on z's boundary. This would make x disconnected from z. Wait, that's not right. If x touches y at a point that's also on z's boundary, then x would be externally connected to z, not disconnected. 

Let me think again. For x to be disconnected from z, x would need to not touch z at all. But since y touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, there are scenarios where x doesn't touch z. For example, x could touch y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z. In this case, x would be separated from z's boundary by some part of z, making DC(x,z) possible.

For EC(x,z):
If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on z's boundary, then x would touch z's boundary without overlapping z's interior, making EC(x,z) possible.

For PO(x,z):
If x overlaps with z, then some part of x must be inside z and some part of x must be outside z. This is possible if x crosses z's boundary. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x could extend from outside z, touch y at a point, and continue into z, creating a partial overlap with z.

Actually, let me be more careful here. If EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at their boundaries; their interiors don't overlap. And if TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary. 

For PO(x,z) to be true, x would need to have some part inside z and some part outside z. But if x only touches y at their boundaries, and y is completely inside z, how can x have a part inside z? It seems like x must be either completely outside z (but possibly touching z's boundary), making EC(x,z) possible, or completely inside z (but touching z's boundary), making TPP(x,z) possible.

Let me reconsider. If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary. If x touches y at a point that's not on z's boundary, then x would be completely outside z, making DC(x,z) the relation. If x touches y at a point that is also on z's boundary, then x would touch z's boundary without overlapping z's interior, making EC(x,z) the relation.

But for PO(x,z) to be true, x would need to have some part inside z and some part outside z. This would mean x crosses z's boundary. But if x only touches y at their boundaries, and y is completely inside z, it's not clear how x can have a part inside z.

Let me think once more. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. If TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. It's possible that x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z. In this case, part of x would be inside z and part would be outside, making PO(x,z) a possibility.

Actually, no, I don't think that works. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. So x can't extend into y's interior. And if y is a tangential proper part of z, then y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is not on z's boundary, then x would be partly inside z and partly outside, making PO(x,z) the relation. But this isn't possible because if EC(x,y), then x can't extend into y's interior, and y is completely inside z.

I think I need to be more precise about the definition of these relations.

For RCC-8:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap).
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

With these definitions, let's reconsider:

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries. If TPP(y,z), then y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

For DC(x,z):
For x to be disconnected from z, x would need to not touch z at all. This is possible if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z. In this case, x would be separated from z's boundary by some part of z's interior, making DC(x,z) possible.

For EC(x,z):
If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on z's boundary, then x would touch z's boundary without overlapping z's interior, making EC(x,z) possible.

For PO(x,z):
For x to partially overlap with z, x would need to have some part inside z and some part outside z. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z, then for PO(x,z) to be true, x would need to extend into the interior of z beyond this contact point. But if EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at their boundaries, and x doesn't extend into y's interior. It's not clear how x can have a part inside z. It seems like PO(x,z) might not be possible.

But wait, if EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries. This means that there's a point p that's in both the boundary of x and the boundary of y. If TPP(y,z), then y is completely contained in z, which means all points in y, including p, are in z. But p is also in the boundary of x, which means it's in x. So p is in both x and z, which suggests that x and z aren't disconnected; they at least touch.

Actually, I need to be more careful. The point p is on the boundary of y, not in the interior of y. If TPP(y,z), then all points in y are in z, but we need to be careful about the boundary. If y touches the boundary of z, then points on the boundary of y might also be on the boundary of z.

Let's try to visualize this. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and x as another circle outside z, touching y's boundary at a point that is also on z's boundary. In this case, x and z are externally connected.

Now, imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and x as another circle outside z, touching y's boundary at a point that is in the interior of z. In this case, x and z are disconnected.

But what about PO(x,z)? Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and x as a shape that touches y's boundary at a point and extends both inside and outside of z. This would make PO(x,z) true. But is this possible with EC(x,y)? If x only touches y at their boundary, it's not clear how x can extend into the interior of z.

Let's consider a different visualization. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and x as a shape that touches y's boundary at a point and extends both inside and outside of z. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y), x would need to not overlap with y's interior. But if x extends into the interior of z, it's not clear how it can avoid overlapping with y's interior, given that y is inside z.

Hmm, I'm having trouble visualizing a scenario where PO(x,z) is possible. Let me try to be more precise.

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. If TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x would need to have some part inside z and some part outside z. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary, then for x to have a part inside z, this point would need to be in the interior of z. But if this point is in the interior of z, it's not clear how x can extend into the interior of z without overlapping with y's interior, which would contradict EC(x,y).

Actually, let me draw up a concrete example. I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let x be everything to the left of the y-axis on the plane, let y be the unit disk centered at (1,0), and let z be the unit disk centered at (2,0). So y and z are unit disks with centers 1 unit apart, so they intersect, and TPP(y,z) is false. Let me try again.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the unit disk centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z. We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be everything to the left of the line x = -0.5. The rightmost point of x is on the line x = -0.5. The leftmost point of y is at (-0.5, 0). So x and y touch at precisely one point, and EC(x,y) is true.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z? We have x is everything to the left of the line x = -0.5, and z is the unit disk centered at the origin. The rightmost point of x is on the line x = -0.5. The leftmost point of z is at (-1, 0). So the rightmost point of x is strictly to the right of the leftmost point of z. This means x and z overlap, and the relation is PO(x,z).

Wait, that's not right. I messed up the definition of x. Let me try again.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the unit disk centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z. We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be the half-plane x <= -0.5. The rightmost point of x is on the line x = -0.5. The leftmost point of y is at (-0.5, 0). So x and y touch at precisely one point, and EC(x,y) is true.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z? We have x is the half-plane x <= -0.5, and z is the unit disk centered at the origin. The rightmost point of x is on the line x = -0.5. The leftmost point of z is at (-1, 0). 

Actually, the leftmost point of z is not at (-1, 0). Since z is the unit disk centered at the origin, its leftmost point is at (-1, 0) and its rightmost point is at (1, 0).

So the rightmost part of x is the line x = -0.5, and this line intersects with z. In fact, a chunk of z (everything in z with x-coordinate <= -0.5) is contained in x. But not all of z is contained in x, because z extends to the right up to x = 1. So x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other, which means PO(x,z).

So, contrary to my earlier reasoning, PO(x,z) is possible when EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

For TPP(x,z):
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is a region inside z that touches z's boundary at a point where y also touches z's boundary. In this case, x would also be externally connected to y, making TPP(x,z) possible.

Actually, let me provide a concrete example. Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the unit disk centered at (0, 0.5). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (0, 1). We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be the unit disk centered at (0, -0.5). x is completely inside z, and x touches the boundary of z at the point (0, -1). Also, x touches y at the point (0,0). So EC(x,y) and TPP(x,z) are both true.

For NTPP(x,z):
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained in the interior of z without touching z's boundary. But if EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary. It's not clear how x can be completely contained in the interior of z without touching z's boundary.

Actually, wait, I think NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the unit disk centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1.5, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be the unit disk centered at (-0.5, 0). x is completely inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z (the leftmost point of x is at (-1.5, 0), which is still inside z). Also, x touches y at the point (0,0). So EC(x,y) and NTPP(x,z) are both true.

Wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. If y is the unit disk centered at (0.5, 0), then the rightmost point of y is at (1.5, 0), which is outside the unit disk z. So TPP(y,z) is not true.

Let me try again. Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (-0.5, 0). x is completely inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z (the leftmost point of x is at (-1, 0), which is on the boundary of z). So x is not completely in the interior of z.

Actually, if the leftmost point of x is at (-1, 0), and that's on the boundary of z, then x touches the boundary of z, which would make TPP(x,z) true, not NTPP(x,z).

Let me try once more. Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.3 centered at (0.7, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be the disk with radius 0.3 centered at (-0.4, 0). The leftmost point of x is at (-0.7, 0), which is inside z. The rightmost point of x is at (-0.1, 0), which doesn't reach the boundary of z. The leftmost point of y is at (0.4, 0). So the distance between the rightmost point of x and the leftmost point of y is 0.5, which is greater than the sum of the radii of x and y (0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6). So x and y don't touch, and EC(x,y) is not true.

Let me try a different approach. Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.4 centered at (0.6, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be the disk with radius 0.3 centered at (-0.1, 0). The leftmost point of x is at (-0.4, 0), which is inside z. The rightmost point of x is at (0.2, 0), which doesn't reach the boundary of z. The leftmost point of y is at (0.2, 0). So the distance between the rightmost point of x and the leftmost point of y is 0, which means x and y touch at precisely one point. So EC(x,y) is true.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z? We have x is the disk with radius 0.3 centered at (-0.1, 0), and z is the unit disk centered at the origin. The leftmost point of x is at (-0.4, 0), which is inside z. The rightmost point of x is at (0.2, 0), which is inside z. In fact, all of x is inside z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z).

Actually wait. The leftmost point of x is at (-0.4, 0), which is inside z. The rightmost point of x is at (0.2, 0), which is also inside z. But the rightmost point of x is at the point where x touches y. Since y touches the boundary of z, this means that the point where x touches y is on the boundary of z. But I just claimed that the rightmost point of x is inside z, not on the boundary. There's a mistake somewhere.

Let's be more careful. I said y is the disk with radius 0.4 centered at (0.6, 0). So the leftmost point of y is at (0.2, 0) and the rightmost point of y is at (1, 0), which is on the boundary of z. And I said x is the disk with radius 0.3 centered at (-0.1, 0). So the leftmost point of x is at (-0.4, 0) and the rightmost point of x is at (0.2, 0). So x and y touch at the point (0.2, 0), which is not on the boundary of z. So x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, which means NTPP(x,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is possible when EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is externally connected to y. If z were a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of x (since y is a proper part of z), which would contradict EC(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z):
For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

For EQ(x,z):
For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be equal. This is not possible because y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is externally connected to y. If x and z were equal, then x would contain y, which would contradict EC(x,y).

So based on my careful analysis, the possible relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I think I should double-check my reasoning for DC(x,z) with an example to ensure it's possible.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.4 centered at (0.6, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be a disk with radius 0.1 centered at (0.3, 0.39). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is sqrt((0.3-0.6)^2 + (0.39-0)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 0.39^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.1521) = sqrt(0.2421) = 0.492. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5. Since the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii, x and y overlap, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me try a different approach. Let x be a disk with radius 0.1 centered at (0.2, 0.39). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is sqrt((0.2-0.6)^2 + (0.39-0)^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.39^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.1521) = sqrt(0.3121) = 0.559. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5. Since the distance between the centers is greater than the sum of the radii, x and y don't touch, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me try again. Let x be a disk with radius 0.1 centered at (0.2, 0.3). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is sqrt((0.2-0.6)^2 + (0.3-0)^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.3^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.25) = 0.5. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5. Since the distance between the centers is equal to the sum of the radii, x and y touch at exactly one point, which means EC(x,y) is true.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z? We have x is the disk with radius 0.1 centered at (0.2, 0.3), and z is the unit disk centered at the origin. The distance from the center of x to the center of z is sqrt(0.2^2 + 0.3^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.13) = 0.36. The sum of the radii of x and z is 0.1 + 1 = 1.1. Since the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii, and also less than the difference of the radii (1 - 0.1 = 0.9), x is completely inside z. But x doesn't touch the boundary of z, because the distance from the center of x to the center of z plus the radius of x is 0.36 + 0.1 = 0.46, which is less than the radius of z. So NTPP(x,z).

This contradicts my earlier claim that DC(x,z) is possible. Let me try to construct an example where DC(x,z) is true.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

Now let x be a disk with radius 0.1 centered at (0.1, 0.6). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is sqrt((0.1-0.5)^2 + (0.6-0)^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.6^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.36) = sqrt(0.52) = 0.721. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.1 + 0.5 = 0.6. Since the distance between the centers is greater than the sum of the radii, x and y don't touch, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me try again. Let x be a disk with radius 0.1 centered at (0.1, 0.5). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is sqrt((0.1-0.5)^2 + (0.5-0)^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.41) = 0.640. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.1 + 0.5 = 0.6. Since the distance between the centers is greater than the sum of the radii, x and y don't touch, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me try once more. Let x be a disk with radius 0.1 centered at (0, 0.5). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is sqrt((0-0.5)^2 + (0.5-0)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) = 0.707. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.1 + 0.5 = 0.6. Since the distance between the centers is greater than the sum of the radii, x and y don't touch, which contradicts EC(x,y).

I'm having trouble constructing an example where EC(x,y) and DC(x,z) are both true. Let me think...

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's try a different approach.

If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary. If x touches y at a point that's not on z's boundary, then x would be partly inside z. If x touches y at a point that is on z's boundary, then x would touch z's boundary without overlapping z's interior, making EC(x,z) the relation.

But for DC(x,z) to be true, x would need to not touch z at all. But if x touches y's boundary, and all of y is inside z, then x must touch z as well. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I've been making an error in my reasoning. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. It doesn't necessarily mean that x touches y at every point on y's boundary. In fact, x typically touches y at isolated points on their boundaries.

Similarly, TPP(y,z) means that y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. It doesn't mean that y touches z's boundary at every point. Typically, y touches z's boundary at isolated points.

So it's possible that x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is not on z's boundary. In this case, x could be completely outside z, making DC(x,z) the relation.

Let me try to construct an example. Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

Now, let's say x touches y at the point (0, 0). This point is on the boundary of y, but it's not on the boundary of z. It's inside z. If x is a disk centered somewhere to the left of the origin, with its rightmost point at (0, 0), then EC(x,y) is true. But x extends into the interior of z, so x and z overlap. This would make PO(x,z) the relation, not DC(x,z).

In fact, if x touches y at any point on y's boundary, and this point is inside z, then x must extend into the interior of z, making PO(x,z) the relation.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x would need to not touch z at all. But if x touches y's boundary, and all of y is inside z (including y's boundary), then x must touch z as well. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait, it's possible that y's boundary isn't entirely inside z. If TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This means that parts of y's boundary could be outside z, and x could touch y at one of these parts, making DC(x,z) possible.

Hmm, but if y is a tangential proper part of z, then y is completely inside z, which means all points in y, including those on its boundary, are in z. So it's not possible for parts of y's boundary to be outside z.

I think I'm getting confused because the definitions I'm using might not be precise enough. Let me be clear:

If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that every point in y is also in z, and there is at least one point that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

If EC(x,y), then x and y are externally connected. This means that x and y have no common interior points, but there is at least one point that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

With these definitions, let's reconsider. If every point in y is also in z, and x touches y at a point, then this point is also in z. So x and z have a common point, which means DC(x,z) is not possible.

OK, I'm realizing now that I misunderstood the definition of TPP. Let me be clear:

If TPP(y,z), then:
1. Every point in y is also in z (i.e., y is a subset of z).
2. There is at least one point in z that is not in y (i.e., y is a proper subset of z).
3. There is at least one point that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z (i.e., y is tangential to z).

And if EC(x,y), then:
1. The interior of x and the interior of y are disjoint (i.e., they don't overlap).
2. There is at least one point that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y (i.e., x and y touch).

With these definitions, let's reconsider. If every point in y is also in z, and x touches y at a point p, then p is also in z. But p is on the boundary of x, not in the interior of x. So it's possible that the interior of x and the interior of z are disjoint, making DC(x,z) a possibility.

Actually, let's be careful about the definition of DC. If DC(x,z), then x and z are disconnected, which means they have no points in common, including boundary points. If EC(x,z), then x and z are externally connected, which means they touch at boundary points but their interiors don't overlap.

If x touches y at a point p, and p is in z (because all of y is in z), then x and z have a common point p. This means DC(x,z) is not possible; at minimum, x and z are externally connected.

But wait, we're thinking about the interiors. If p is a point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of z, and x touches y at p, then x touches z at p as well. This would make EC(x,z) the relation, not DC(x,z).

On the other hand, if p is a point on the boundary of y that is in the interior of z, and x touches y at p, then x touches a point in the interior of z. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the interior of x overlaps with the interior of z. If the interiors don't overlap, then EC(x,z) is the relation. If the interiors do overlap, then PO(x,z) is the relation.

I'm getting a bit confused with all these boundary cases. Let me try to visualize a specific example to help clarify.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

Now, let's say x touches y at the point (0, 0). This point is on the boundary of y, and it's in the interior of z. If x is a disk centered at (-0.5, 0) with radius 0.5, then its rightmost point is at (0, 0), which is where it touches y. So EC(x,y) is true.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z? We have x is the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (-0.5, 0), and z is the unit disk centered at the origin. The rightmost point of x is at (0, 0), which is in the interior of z. But the leftmost point of x is at (-1, 0), which is on the boundary of z. So x intersects with z, and part of x is outside of z. This makes PO(x,z) the relation.

But what if x is a bit smaller? Let's say x is a disk with radius 0.4 centered at (-0.4, 0). Its rightmost point is at (0, 0), which is where it touches y. So EC(x,y) is true. The leftmost point of x is at (-0.8, 0), which is inside z. In fact, all of x is inside z. But x touches the boundary of y at a point that is in the interior of z, so x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This makes NTPP(x,z) the relation.

And what if x is a bit larger? Let's say x is a disk with radius 0.6 centered at (-0.6, 0). Its rightmost point is at (0, 0), which is where it touches y. So EC(x,y) is true. The leftmost point of x is at (-1.2, 0), which is outside z. So x extends both inside and outside of z, making PO(x,z) the relation.

But can DC(x,z) be possible? For DC(x,z) to be true, x would need to not touch z at all. But if x touches y at a point, and this point is in z (because all of y is in z), then x touches z as well. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So I believe the possible relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, to be thorough, let me also check if EC(x,z) is possible with an example.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

If x touches y at the point (1, 0), which is also on the boundary of z, then x would touch z at the boundary. If x is a disk with radius 0.5 centered at (1.5, 0), then its leftmost point is at (1, 0), which is where it touches both y and z. So EC(x,y) and EC(x,z) are both true.

Great, so EC(x,z) is possible.

Let me also check if TPP(x,z) is possible with an example.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (1, 0). We have TPP(y,z).

If x touches y at the point (1, 0), which is also on the boundary of z, then x would touch z at the boundary. If x is a disk with radius 0.3 centered at (0.7, 0), then its rightmost point is at (1, 0), which is where it touches both y and z. The leftmost point of x is at (0.4, 0), which is inside both y and z. So EC(x,y) and TPP(x,z) are both true.

Wait, if the rightmost point of x is at (1, 0) and the leftmost point of y is at (0, 0), then x and y overlap in the region from (0.4, 0) to (1, 0), which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me try again. I think I'm making a mistake in visualizing the scenario. If y is the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0), then the leftmost point of y is at (0, 0) and the rightmost point of y is at (1, 0).

If x touches y at the point (0, 0), which is on the boundary of y, then x would touch y at the boundary. If x is a disk with radius 0.3 centered at (-0.3, 0), then its rightmost point is at (0, 0), which is where it touches y. The leftmost point of x is at (-0.6, 0), which is inside z. So EC(x,y) is true, and all of x is inside z. But does x touch the boundary of z?

The distance from the center of x to the center of z is 0.3. The sum of the radius of x and the radius of z is 0.3 + 1 = 1.3. Since the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii, x and z overlap. The distance from the center of x to the center of z minus the radius of x is 0.3 - 0.3 = 0, which is less than the radius of z. So all of x is inside z. But the distance from the center of x to the center of z plus the radius of x is 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6, which is less than the radius of z. So x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So EC(x,y) and NTPP(x,z) are both true in this example.

Let me try once more for TPP(x,z). If x touches y at the point (1, 0), which is also on the boundary of z, then x would touch z at the boundary. 

Ah, I see the problem. If y is the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0), then the leftmost point of y is at (0, 0) and the rightmost point of y is at (1, 0). If x touches y at (1, 0), then x also touches z at the boundary. 

But if x is a region that touches y only at (1, 0) and extends inward into z, then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

Let's say x is the disk with radius 0.3 centered at (0.8, 0.25). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is sqrt((0.8-0.5)^2 + (0.25-0)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.1525) = 0.391. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8. Since the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii, x and y overlap, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me try a different approach. If y is the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0), then the leftmost point of y is at (0, 0) and the rightmost point of y is at (1, 0). If x is a region that touches y only at (1, 0) and is entirely within z, then EC(x,y) and TPP(x,z) would both be true.

One such region could be a disk with its rightmost point at (1, 0), and the rest of the disk extending inward into z.

Actually, to make this simpler, let's use a different shape for x. Let's say x is a line segment from (0.7, 0) to (1, 0). This line segment touches y at the point (1, 0), which is also on the boundary of z. So EC(x,y) and TPP(x,z) are both true.

Actually, I don't think that's right. Let me be careful about the definitions again. A region in RCC-8 is a non-empty set with a well-defined interior, boundary, and exterior. A line segment might not qualify. Let's stick with disks for now.

If y is the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0.5, 0), let's say x is a smaller disk that touches y at exactly one point, and that point is on the boundary of z. For example, x could be the disk with radius 0.2 centered at (0.85, 0.15). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is sqrt((0.85-0.5)^2 + (0.15-0)^2) = sqrt(0.35^2 + 0.15^2) = sqrt(0.1225 + 0.0225) = sqrt(0.145) = 0.381. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.7. Since the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii, x and y overlap, which contradicts EC(x,y).

I'm having trouble constructing an example where EC(x,y) and TPP(x,z) are both true. It's not clear to me if this is possible.

Actually, thinking more about it, I'm not convinced that TPP(x,z) is possible when EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). Let me reason through this...

If TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y. If TPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Since TPP(y,z), y touches z's boundary at some point, let's call it p. If EC(x,y), then x touches y's boundary at some point, let's call it q. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must touch z's boundary at some point, let's call it r.

If q = p, then r = p as well, and we have a point that is on the boundary of x, the boundary of y, and the boundary of z. This is a plausible scenario.

If q is not p, then q is a point on the boundary of y that is in the interior of z. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must touch the boundary of z at some point r, which is different from q. But then x would have to extend from q to r, which might force it to overlap with y, contradicting EC(x,y).

Actually, I'm not sure if that reasoning is correct. Let me try to construct a concrete example instead.

Let z be the unit disk centered at the origin, let y be the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0, 0.5). So y is a disk inside z, and y touches the boundary of z at the point (0, 1). We have TPP(y,z).

Now let's say x is a disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0, -0.5). The distance from the center of x to the center of y is 1. The sum of the radii of x and y is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. Since the distance between the centers is equal to the sum of the radii, x and y touch at exactly one point, which is (0, 0). So EC(x,y) is true.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z? We have x is the disk with radius 0.5 centered at (0, -0.5), and z is the unit disk centered at the origin. The distance from the center of x to the center of z is 0.5. The sum of the radii of x and z is 0.5 + 1 = 1.5. Since the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii, x and z overlap. The distance from the center of x to the center of z plus the radius of x is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is equal to the radius of z. So x touches the boundary of z at the point (0, -1). And all of x is inside z. So TPP(x,z) is true.

Great, so I've shown that TPP(x,z) is possible when EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

So based on my careful analysis, the possible relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I don't think DC(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) are possible.

Actually, I just realized that I should double check whether my reasoning is correct for the DC relation. I previously claimed that if EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then DC(x,z) is not possible because if x touches y at a point, and all of y is in z, then this point is also in z, so x touches z as well.

But let me be more careful about the definitions again. If TPP(y,z), then every point in y is also in z, and there is at least one point that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z. If EC(x,y), then the interior of x and the interior of y are disjoint, and there is at least one point that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

Let's say x touches y at a point p that is on the boundary of y. Since all of y is in z, p is also in z. But p could be in the interior of z, not on the boundary of z. So it's possible that x touches a point in the interior of z, but the interior of x doesn't overlap with the interior of z. However, because the interior of z includes all points in z that aren't on the boundary of z, and p is in the interior of z, we actually do have a situation where the interior of x and the interior of z are not disjoint. This is because p is on the boundary of x and in the interior of z, which means arbitrarily close to p, there are points in both the interior of x and the interior of z.

So DC(x,z) is not possible because the interiors of x and z are not disjoint. At minimum, x and z are externally connected.

So based on my careful analysis, the possible relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I don't think DC(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) are possible.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z when we know that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
- TPP(y,z): y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible
   If x touches y at some point p, and y is completely contained in z, then p must also be in z. Therefore x and z must share at least one point, so they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible
   If x touches y at a point that's also on z's boundary, then x can touch z at their boundaries without their interiors overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible
   If x touches y at a point in z's interior, x can extend both inside and outside z, creating a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible
   If x touches y (possibly at z's boundary) and is completely contained in z while also touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible
   If x touches y at a point in z's interior and is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible
   If z were contained in x, then y would also be contained in x (since y is in z), contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible
   For the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible
   If x were equal to z, then y would be contained in x, contradicting EC(x,y).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
