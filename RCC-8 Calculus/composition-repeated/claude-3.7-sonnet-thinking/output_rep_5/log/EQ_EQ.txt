PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully. 

I'm given that:
- EQ(x, y), which means that x and y are coincident (the same region).
- EQ(y, z), which means that y and z are coincident (the same region).

The question asks about the possible relationships between x and z.

Since x and y are coincident, they are exactly the same region. And since y and z are coincident, they are exactly the same region. By transitivity, x and z must also be coincident, which means EQ(x, z).

To double-check, let's consider what each of the other relations would mean:

DC(x, z) - This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since x is the same as y, and y is the same as z, this can't be true.
EC(x, z) - This would mean x and z touch at a boundary. But since x is the same as y, and y is the same as z, this can't be true.
PO(x, z) - This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since x is the same as y, and y is the same as z, this can't be true.
TPP(x, z) - This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since x is the same as y, and y is the same as z, this can't be true.
NTPP(x, z) - This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But since x is the same as y, and y is the same as z, this can't be true.
TPPi(x, z) - This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since x is the same as y, and y is the same as z, this can't be true.
NTPPi(x, z) - This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But since x is the same as y, and y is the same as z, this can't be true.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x, z).

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), let's analyze the situation:

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (the same region).
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (the same region).

Since x is the same region as y, and y is the same region as z, by transitivity, x must be the same region as z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
