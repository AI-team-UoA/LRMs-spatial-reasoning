PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out what the relationship can be between x and z, given that:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Let me analyze this systematically:

We know x is inside y and touches y's boundary. And y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Since x is part of y, and y is part of z, it follows that x is part of z. So our answer will be one of the "part" relations - either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Now, the question is whether x touches z's boundary or not.

Since x touches y's boundary, and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), x can't reach z's boundary through y. But that doesn't completely determine whether x touches z's boundary or not.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y is not touching z's boundary (which is always the case since NTPP(y,z)), then x does not touch z's boundary. This would mean NTPP(x,z).

So based on the given information, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this reasoning by thinking about specific examples.

Imagine:
- x is a circle touching the inside edge of a larger circle y
- y is a circle completely contained within a larger circle z

In this case, x is definitely completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which confirms NTPP(x,z).

However, I need to be careful about my reasoning. Let me think step by step again:

1. TPP(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z) means y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since y is completely inside z (with some space between y and z's boundary), and x is inside y touching y's boundary, x must be completely inside z with some space between x and z's boundary. This means x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I should double-check this with another approach. Let's use the properties of these relations.

If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then:
- x is inside y, touching y's boundary
- y is inside z, not touching z's boundary

Since y is not touching z's boundary, and x is inside y, x must also not touch z's boundary. This confirms that the relationship is NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I should be even more careful here. Let me try to construct a counter-example where TPP(x,z) might be possible.

If x is touching y's boundary at a point, and y is completely inside z but not touching z's boundary... 

No, I can't construct a scenario where x would touch z's boundary in this case. Since y has some distance from z's boundary (being NTPP), and x is contained within y (possibly touching y's boundary), x must also have some distance from z's boundary.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, I should make sure I'm understanding TPP correctly. TPP(x,y) means x is a "tangential proper part" of y, which means x is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary. It doesn't mean x extends beyond y's boundary - that would contradict the "proper part" aspect.

So my reasoning above is correct: if x is inside y touching y's boundary, and y is inside z not touching z's boundary, then x must be inside z not touching z's boundary, which is NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is: NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship can exist between x and z given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary

Working through the implications:
1. Since TPP(x,y), we know x is completely contained within y (touching y's boundary)
2. Since NTPP(y,z), we know y is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary
3. By transitivity of containment, x must be completely contained within z

The key question is: can x touch z's boundary?
- Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z))
- And x is fully contained within y
- Then x must be separated from z's boundary by at least the same distance that separates y from z's boundary

Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary, making the only possible relationship NTPP(x,z).
