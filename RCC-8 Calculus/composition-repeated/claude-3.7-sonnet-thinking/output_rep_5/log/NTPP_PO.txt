PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step by step.

We know:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. This means y and z share some common part, but neither is contained within the other.

The question asks: What are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Since x is entirely within y, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   Given that x is a non-tangential proper part of y (meaning x doesn't touch y's boundary), and z is partially overlapping with y, it's possible that x touches the boundary of the overlapping region between y and z. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

Wait, let me reconsider this. Actually, if x doesn't touch y's boundary (since it's a non-tangential proper part), then x can't touch z's boundary if z is outside of y. So, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   It's possible that x partially overlaps with the overlapping region of y and z. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given that x is entirely within y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x is contained within the overlapping region of y and z and touches the boundary of this region. So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. It's possible that x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and doesn't touch the boundary of this region. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. Given that x is entirely within y and y partially overlaps with z, z can't be completely contained within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to the above, given that x is entirely within y and y partially overlaps with z, z can't be completely contained within x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   Given that x is a proper part of y and y partially overlaps with z, x can't be equal to z. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, wait let's double-check the TPP(x,z) situation. TPP(x,z) would mean that x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, x doesn't touch y's boundary. 

If z extends beyond y (which it does in a PO relationship), and x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, can x touch z's boundary? It seems like x can only touch z's boundary if z's boundary passes through the interior of y. This is possible in a PO relationship, so TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Wait, let me rethink the EC(x,z) situation again. EC(x,z) would mean that x and z share a boundary point but no interior points. Given that x is a non-tangential proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z partially overlaps with y, can x and z be externally connected?

For x and z to be externally connected, they would have to touch at a boundary point. However, x doesn't touch y's boundary. If z overlaps with y, then there's a region that's common to both y and z. If x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then it can either be:
1. Entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, making it a part of z (either TPP or NTPP).
2. Partially within the overlapping region, making it partially overlap with z (PO).
3. Entirely outside the overlapping region, making it disconnected from z (DC).

It doesn't seem possible for x to be externally connected to z. So, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I need to be more careful about the TPP(x,z) case. TPP(x,z) would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x touches the boundary of z. 

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), then x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, consider the overlapping region of y and z, which we'll call O. If x is entirely within O, then x is a proper part of z. The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

The boundary of z that's within y is the boundary of the overlapping region O. If x touches this boundary, then x would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)). This is possible if x is positioned in such a way that it touches the boundary of O.

So, TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z):
1. DC(x,z): x can be entirely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
2. PO(x,z): x can partially overlap with the part of y that overlaps with z.
3. TPP(x,z): x can be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touch the boundary of this region.
4. NTPP(x,z): x can be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and not touch the boundary of this region.

Given these considerations, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me re-evaluate the TPP(x,z) case even more carefully.

TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z. This implies that:
1. x is entirely within z.
2. x touches the boundary of z.

Given NTPP(x,y), x is entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x must touch the boundary of z at some point. This boundary point of z must be inside y (since x is entirely inside y). But it's also a boundary point of z, which means it's a point where z transitions from being present to being absent. 

Now, given PO(y,z), there are parts of z outside of y. So, this boundary point is a point where z extends outside of y. But wait, that would be a boundary point of y as well. And since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)), x can't touch this boundary point of z.

However, there's another kind of boundary point of z: the internal boundary. These are points within y where z ends. If x touches these internal boundary points of z, then TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

To provide a visual:
- y is a large circle.
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with y.
- The overlapping region, O, is the intersection of y and z.
- x is a small circle entirely within y (and doesn't touch y's boundary).

If x touches the boundary of O that's inside y, then TPP(x,z) holds.

I think my reasoning above is correct, and TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So, given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is entirely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with the overlapping region of y and z.
- TPP(x,z): x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches the internal boundary of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

But actually, let's think more about TPP(x, z) and make sure we're right:

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, which means they share a common part, but neither is entirely contained within the other.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must touch the boundary of z. Since x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, x can only touch the internal boundary of z, which is the boundary of the overlapping region between y and z.

Upon further reflection, I'm confident that TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility. 

So, given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm still not entirely sure about the TPP(x,z) case. Let's try to reason through it more systematically.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

We want to determine if TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

TPP(x,z) means:
1. x is a proper part of z (i.e., x is entirely inside z).
2. x touches the boundary of z.

For x to be entirely inside z, it must be within the overlapping region of y and z.

Now, can x touch the boundary of z? The boundary of z consists of two parts:
1. The boundary of z that's outside of y.
2. The boundary of z that's inside y, which is the boundary of the overlapping region between y and z.

Since x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, x can't touch the boundary of z that's outside of y. But x can touch the boundary of z that's inside y, which is the boundary of the overlapping region.

So, TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility if x is positioned in such a way that it touches the boundary of the overlapping region between y and z.

To provide a visual:
- y is a large circle.
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with y.
- The overlapping region, O, is the intersection of y and z.
- x is a small circle entirely within y (and doesn't touch y's boundary).

If x touches the boundary of O inside y, then TPP(x,z) holds.

Given these considerations, I believe TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Therefore, given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, I think I overcomplicated things. Let me think through this one more time with a simpler approach.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. This means they share a common part, but neither is entirely contained within the other.

Now, let's consider the relationship between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z are disconnected. This is a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   For x and z to be externally connected, they would have to touch at a boundary point. 
   
   Here's the thing: If x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z extends beyond y, then x can't touch the part of z's boundary that's outside of y. 
   
   Could x touch the boundary of z that's inside y? This boundary is the boundary of the overlapping region between y and z. 
   
   If x touches this boundary, it means x touches a point that's inside y but on the boundary of z. At this point, z transitions from being present to being absent inside y. 
   
   If x touches this boundary point, then x and z would not be externally connected, but rather, x would be a tangential proper part of z or partially overlap with z (depending on whether x is entirely inside z or not). 
   
   So, EC(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   If x is partially inside the overlapping region of y and z, then x and z partially overlap. This is a valid possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. 
   
   For x to be entirely inside z, it must be within the overlapping region of y and z. 
   
   The boundary of z inside y is the boundary of the overlapping region. If x touches this boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z. This is a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. 
   
   If x is entirely inside the overlapping region of y and z and doesn't touch the boundary of this region, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. 
   
   Given that y and z partially overlap, z extends beyond y. Since x is entirely inside y, z can't be entirely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. 
   
   Similar to the above, given that y and z partially overlap, z extends beyond y. Since x is entirely inside y, z can't be entirely inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   Given that x is a proper part of y and y partially overlaps with z, x can't be equal to z. So, EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

So, given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I've now considered this problem multiple times and have consistently arrived at the same answer. I'm confident that the valid possibilities are DC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Here's a succinct explanation for each:

- DC(x,z): x can be entirely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
- PO(x,z): x can partially overlap with the overlapping region of y and z.
- TPP(x,z): x can be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touch the boundary of this region.
- NTPP(x,z): x can be entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and not touch the boundary of this region.

Therefore, given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), I'll analyze the constraints:

- NTPP(x,y): x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some area, but neither contains the other)

Looking at the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x is located in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), and z only partially overlaps with y, x cannot be externally connected to z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x partially extends into the overlapping region of y and z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, and touches the boundary of this overlapping region (which is part of z's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, without touching the boundary of this region.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z extends outside of y (from PO(y,z)), while x is completely inside y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because z extends outside of y, while x is completely inside y.
