PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work this out step by step.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a proper part of x and y does not touch the boundary of x. So y is completely in the interior of x.

2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

- Since y is completely contained in the interior of x, and z shares some part with y, it means z must also penetrate into the interior of x. 

- However, since y and z only partially overlap, some part of z is outside of y.

This part of z that is outside of y could be:
a) Still inside x (in which case z is fully contained in x)
b) Partially inside and partially outside x (in which case z partially overlaps with x)
c) Touches the boundary of x from inside (creating a tangential proper part relation)

Let's analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know z shares a part with y, which is inside x. So z must share a part with x as well. Therefore, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z only touch at their boundaries. But again, z shares a part with y, which is strictly inside x. So z must penetrate the interior of x, which contradicts EC. Therefore, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of z is inside x (the part that overlaps with y) and part of z is outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. Since y is completely inside x and y overlaps with z, this would require z to completely contain x, and for x to touch the boundary of z. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would require z to completely contain x, including its boundary. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is inside x and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be completely inside x and touch its boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that y is inside x and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be completely inside x without touching its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. This is possible only if the part of y that doesn't overlap with z is empty, and the part of z that doesn't overlap with y exactly fills the rest of x.

Let's reconsider these:

For EQ(x,z), this would mean x and z are the same region. But we know that y is strictly inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z (from PO(y,z)). If x and z are the same, then y would be strictly inside z as well, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

For TPP(x,z), this would mean x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. However, y is strictly inside x, which means y is also inside z. But PO(y,z) says y and z partially overlap, which means some part of y is outside z. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

For NTPP(x,z), this would mean x is strictly inside z. Again, this would mean y is also strictly inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

Let's re-analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because z overlaps with y, which is inside x.
2. EC(x,z): Impossible for the same reason as DC.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. Part of z overlaps with y (which is inside x), and part of z could be outside x.
4. TPP(x,z): Impossible because if x is inside z, then y would also be inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).
5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible for the same reason as TPP.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be inside x and touch the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be strictly inside x.
8. EQ(x,z): Impossible because it would make y strictly inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

Wait, I think I need to think more carefully about this problem.

Let's break it down visually:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - some of y is in z, some of y is outside z, some of z is in y, and some of z is outside y

Now, let's consider where z can be in relation to x:

1. Some part of z must be inside x because z overlaps with y, and y is inside x.
2. Some part of z could be outside x. This would lead to PO(x,z).
3. z could be completely inside x. This would lead to either TPPi(x,z) (if z touches the boundary of x) or NTPPi(x,z) (if z doesn't touch the boundary of x).

So, the possible relations are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Let me just double-check each relation again:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because z shares a part with y, which is inside x.
2. EC(x,z): Impossible for the same reason.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. Part of z overlaps with y (inside x), and part of z could be outside x.
4. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. But PO(y,z) says part of y is outside z. So this is impossible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is impossible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be strictly inside x.
8. EQ(x,z): If x equals z, then y (which is inside x) would be inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So this is impossible.

Actually, let me revise 6 again. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be entirely within x and touch x's boundary. But z also must overlap with y, which is strictly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and z also overlaps with y, then TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

So the possible relations are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's think about this step by step once more.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is entirely within the interior of x (does not touch x's boundary).
2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Given these, we know:
- Some part of z is shared with y, which is inside x. So, part of z is inside x.
- Since y and z partially overlap, some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

The part of z that's outside y could either be inside x or outside x. Let's analyze both cases:

Case 1: All of z is inside x. In this case, z is a proper part of x. Since z overlaps with y, which is strictly inside x, the relationship could be either TPPi(x,z) (if z touches x's boundary) or NTPPi(x,z) (if z is strictly inside x).

Case 2: Some of z is outside x. In this case, the relationship is PO(x,z) - they partially overlap.

So, the possible relations are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I still need to be more careful.

Actually, let me start by recalling the RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They don't share any points.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but their interiors are disjoint.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. (Inverse of TPP)
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. (Inverse of NTPP)
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Now, given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? No, because z shares points with y, which is inside x.
2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected? No, because z shares interior points with y, which is inside x. So, z must also share interior points with x.
3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, z could have some parts inside x (the parts that overlap with y) and some parts outside x.
4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If this were the case, y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. But PO(y,z) tells us that y is not inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is strictly inside z. Again, this would make y strictly inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be strictly inside x, not touching its boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? If they were, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. But PO(y,z) says y and z partially overlap, not that y is inside z. So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

To recap, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

I think I should draw some diagrams to make sure. Let's think of them as nested circles for this exercise, where the interior of a circle represents the region.

If we start with NTPPi(x,y), we have y as a circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.

Now, for PO(y,z), z partially overlaps with y. Let's say z is a circle that intersects y, with part of z inside y and part outside.

Based on this setup:
1. If z extends beyond the boundary of x, then PO(x,z) holds.
2. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.
3. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relations are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, there's one more relation I need to consider: EQ(x,z).

Could x and z be equal? If they were, then y (which is strictly inside x) would also be strictly inside z. But PO(y,z) says y and z partially overlap, which means neither is fully contained in the other. So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

To finalize: the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I should just be completely certain about my analysis and reason more carefully from the definitions.

1. NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, y is completely inside the interior of x.

2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other. So, there are parts of y not in z, and parts of z not in y.

Now, let's consider all RCC-8 relations for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. However, since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must also overlap with x. So, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected, touching only at their boundaries. Since z overlaps with y, which is inside the interior of x, z must also share interior points with x. So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given that z overlaps with y (which is inside x), and PO(y,z) implies that parts of z are not in y, those parts of z could be outside x. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. But PO(y,z) says parts of y are not in z. So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to TPP, this would imply y is inside z, contradicting PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z overlaps with y (which is inside x), z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z overlaps with y (which is inside x), z could be completely inside the interior of x without touching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If they were, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. But PO(y,z) says parts of y are not in z. So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check everything once more to be absolutely certain.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let's analyze what these tell us about the relationship between x and z:

Since PO(y,z), there are interior points of y that are also interior points of z. And since NTPPi(x,y), all points of y (including these shared points) are interior points of x. So, there are interior points of z that are also interior points of x. This means z and x cannot be DC or EC; they must share interior points.

Now, PO(y,z) also tells us that there are points of y not in z. Since all points of y are interior points of x, these points of y that are not in z are still interior points of x. This means there are interior points of x that are not in z, so x is not contained in z. This rules out TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Finally, PO(y,z) tells us that there are points of z not in y. These points could either be interior to x or outside x, leading to different relations:
1. If all of z is inside x, then either TPPi(x,z) (if z touches x's boundary) or NTPPi(x,z) (if z doesn't touch x's boundary).
2. If some of z is outside x, then PO(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me draw a rough sketch with letters as my regions just to be absolutely certain:

For NTPPi(x,y):
x = ooooooooooo
    o         o
    o  yyy    o
    o  yyy    o
    o  yyy    o
    o         o
    ooooooooooo

where y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

For PO(y,z):
y = yyyyy
    yyyyy
    yyyyy

z =   zzzzz
      zzzzz
      zzzzz

resulting in:
y = yyyyy
    yyssssy
    yyssssy

z =   ssssszz
      ssssszz
      ssssszz

where 's' denotes the overlap between y and z.

Now, combining these:
x = ooooooooooo
    o         o
    o  yyssy  o
    o  yysssy o
    o  yysssy o
    o      zz o
    ooooooooooo

This is one possible configuration where z is completely inside x, resulting in NTPPi(x,z).

But z could also touch the boundary of x:
x = ooooooooooo
    o         o
    o  yyssy  o
    o  yysssy o
    o  yysssy o
    o      zz o
    oooooozzzzoo

Here, TPPi(x,z) holds.

Or z could extend outside of x:
x = ooooooooooo
    o         o
    o  yyssy  o
    o  yysssy o
    o  yysssy o
    o      zz o
    ooooooooooo
           zzzz
           zzzz

In this case, PO(x,z) holds.

So, based on the geometric interpretation, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Now I'm completely convinced that these are the only possible relations: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

To double-check once more, let's try to construct a scenario for each of the 8 RCC-8 relations and see if it contradicts the given constraints.

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then z cannot overlap with y, which is inside x. This contradicts PO(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected, they share boundary points but no interior points. Since y is inside the interior of x and overlaps with z, z must share interior points with x. This contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible, as demonstrated in the sketch above.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, this would imply y is inside z, contradicting PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible, as demonstrated in the sketch.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is also possible, as demonstrated in the sketch.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If they were, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Just to be sure, let me be more precise about the contradictions in the problematic cases:

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. In formal terms, x ⊂ z and x ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅. If TPP(x,z) is true, then for any region y such that y ⊂ x, we would also have y ⊂ z. Now, given NTPPi(x,y), we know NTPP(y,x), which means y ⊂ x and y ∩ ∂x = ∅. If TPP(x,z) is true, then y ⊂ z. But PO(y,z) means y and z share interior points, but neither is contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) contradicts PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In formal terms, x ⊂ z and x ∩ ∂z = ∅. Similar to TPP, if NTPP(x,z) is true, then for any region y such that y ⊂ x, we would also have y ⊂ z. Given NTPPi(x,y), we know NTPP(y,x), which means y ⊂ x. If NTPP(x,z) is true, then y ⊂ z. But PO(y,z) means y and z share interior points, but neither is contained in the other. So, NTPP(x,z) contradicts PO(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. In formal terms, x = z. If EQ(x,z) is true, then for any region y such that y ⊂ x, we would also have y ⊂ z. Given NTPPi(x,y), we know NTPP(y,x), which means y ⊂ x. If EQ(x,z) is true, then y ⊂ z. But PO(y,z) means y and z share interior points, but neither is contained in the other. So, EQ(x,z) contradicts PO(y,z).

I'm now completely satisfied with the conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, there's one edge case I need to check: is DC(x,z) possible if PO(y,z) holds? It seems that if z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, then z must overlap with x.

Let me recall the definitions:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. They share no points.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given NTPPi(x,y), all points of y are interior points of x. And given PO(y,z), some interior points of y are also interior points of z. So, there are interior points of z that are also interior points of x. This means z and x must share points, which contradicts DC(x,z).

Similarly, EC(x,z) would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since z shares interior points with y, which is inside the interior of x, z must also share interior points with x. This contradicts EC(x,z).

The three relations I've identified as possible—PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z)—all allow z to share interior points with x, which is consistent with the given constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Let me make a final check to see if the given constraints allow for DCx,z). 

DC(x,z) would mean x and z have no common points. However, since NTPPi(x,y), all points of y are interior points of x. And since PO(y,z), y and z share interior points. These shared points between y and z would also be interior points of x. So, x and z must share points, which means DC(x,z) is impossible.

Now I am convinced the answer is:
The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

So the final answer is:
### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible. Since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must share points with x.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible. Since z shares interior points with y (which is in x's interior), z must share interior points with x, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Z can share interior points with x (via y) while also extending outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): Impossible. If x were inside z, then y would be completely inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. Z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary while overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. Z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary while overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z were identical, y would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
