{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given the information:\n- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)\n- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior points\n\nSince EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical spatial regions, x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z. Because y is externally connected to z, x must also be externally connected to z.\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 10.541220426559448, "reasoning-tokens": 522, "completion-tokens": 522}
