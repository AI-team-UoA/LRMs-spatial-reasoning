PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

In this question, we're told about two relationships:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. PO(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

The question asks about the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think about what these two facts tell us.

From DC(x,y), we know that x and y are completely disconnected. They don't overlap or touch at the boundary.

From PO(y,z), we know that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

The key insight is that y shares parts with z but is completely disconnected from x. So what can we say about x and z?

Let's think about each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x is also disconnected from z. For example, imagine x and z as two distinct regions that are far apart, and y as a region that overlaps with z but is far from x.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, x could still touch z at the boundary. For instance, imagine a scenario where x and z touch at a boundary, and y overlaps with z but is positioned such that it doesn't touch x.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x could share some part with z, even though it's disconnected from y. For example, imagine x and z overlapping in one area, while y overlaps with z in a different area and is completely disconnected from x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, x could still be inside z. For instance, z could be a large region, with x inside it and touching its boundary, and y overlapping with z in a different area but not touching x.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). This is possible. x could be completely inside z, away from its boundary, and y could overlap with z in a different area, being disconnected from x.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). This is not possible. If z is inside x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). This is not possible. If z is completely inside x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z coincide completely. This is not possible. If x and z are the same, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

Actually let me double check the reasonoing for these cases more explicitly.

1. DC(x,z): Is x disconnected from z possible? Yes. x could be in a completely different region from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): Is x externally connected to z possible? Yes. x could touch z at the boundary, while y overlaps with z but doesn't reach the part where x touches z.

3. PO(x,z): Is x partially overlapping z possible? Yes. x could overlap with z in one part, while y overlaps with z in a different part, keeping x and y disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): Is x a tangential proper part of z possible? Yes. x could be inside z, touching its boundary, while y overlaps with z in a part that doesn't include x.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is x a non-tangential proper part of z possible? Yes. x could be completely inside z, while y overlaps with z in a part that doesn't include x.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is z a tangential proper part of x possible? 
Let's think carefully. If z is inside x, touching x's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z. Now, to maintain DC(x,y), y must not share any part with x. But if y overlaps with z, and z is completely inside x, then y must also overlap with x. This is a contradiction. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is z a non-tangential proper part of x possible? Again, if z is completely inside x, away from its boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x. This contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is x equal to z possible? If x and z are identical, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also partially overlap with x. This contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

OK, actually I have a bit of uncertainty about case 6, TPPi(x,z). Let's reason step by step.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which is equivalent to TPP(z,x).

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x, touching x's boundary. Given PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z, meaning they share some parts.

Now, if z is inside x, and y overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x in some way. But this contradicts the given DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I'm starting to think I might have been confused about the exact definition of PO. Let me revisit the relation:

PO(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

This means y and z overlap, but no containment is involved.

Now, let's reconsider TPPi(x,z):

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which is equivalent to TPP(z,x).

If z is inside x (touching x's boundary), and y overlaps with z, then by transitivity, y must also overlap with x, which contradicts DC(x,y). Hence, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I'm not sure if "transitivity" is the right term here. But the concept is that if y overlaps with z, and z is inside x, then y must overlap with x at least partially. This would contradict DC(x,y).

Actually, I'm going to draw out each of these cases to make sure I understand the implications correctly.

For case 6, TPPi(x,z):
We have:
- z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x, touching x's boundary.
- y partially overlaps with z. This means y and z share some parts, but neither is part of the other.

Now, since z is inside x, and y overlaps with z, this means y would also overlap with x. But this contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected (DC(x,y)). Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For case 7, NTPPi(x,z):
We have:
- z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- y partially overlaps with z. This means y and z share some parts, but neither is part of the other.

Like in the previous case, if z is inside x, and y overlaps with z, then y would also overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For case 8, EQ(x,z):
We have:
- x and z are equal. This means they are the same region.
- y partially overlaps with z. This means y and z share some parts.

If x and z are equal, and y overlaps with z, then y would also overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

That means the answer is DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) as well.

For TPP(x,z):
We have:
- x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z, touching z's boundary.
- y partially overlaps with z. This means y and z share some parts, but neither is part of the other.

Since x is inside z, and y overlaps with z, is it possible that y and x are disconnected? Yes, consider: z is a large region, x is inside z touching z's boundary at one end, and y overlaps with z at the other end, far away from x. In this scenario, x and y don't overlap or touch, maintaining DC(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
We have:
- x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z, not touching z's boundary.
- y partially overlaps with z. This means y and z share some parts, but neither is part of the other.

Like in the previous case, z can be a large region, x is deep inside z, and y overlaps with z at a part that's far from x. In this scenario, x and y don't overlap or touch, maintaining DC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So that's our final answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's analyze each possible relationship:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be disconnected from z while y partially overlaps with z but remains disconnected from x.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary while y overlaps with a different part of z, maintaining disconnection from x.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z in one area while y overlaps with z in a different area, keeping x and y disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z (touching z's boundary) while y overlaps with z in a region that doesn't include x.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z while y overlaps with z in a region that doesn't include x.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is inside x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is completely inside x, and y overlaps with z, then y must overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are identical, and y overlaps with z, then y must overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).
