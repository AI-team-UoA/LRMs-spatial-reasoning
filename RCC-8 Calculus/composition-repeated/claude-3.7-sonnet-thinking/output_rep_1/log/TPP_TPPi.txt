PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's start by understanding the constraints we have.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, but described in inverse terms. So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). This means that z is part of y, and z touches the boundary of y.

Hmm, but that can't be right, because we can't have both y being part of z and z being part of y (unless y = z, which would be EQ(y,z), not TPP(y,z)).

Let me rethink this. The description says:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

So, TPPi(y,z) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary. But that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Let me reread the description carefully.

Oh, I see. The description states:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Actually, let me be even more precise. The description states:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

Given TPPi(y,z), we can substitute and say TPP(z,y). This means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPP(z,y): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z. Both x and z are parts of y, and both touch y's boundary.

Given these, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z could be:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect (they touch but don't overlap).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

Let's see which of these are consistent with TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Both x and z can be parts of y without intersecting each other.
2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. Both x and z can be parts of y and touch each other at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): This is also possible. Both x and z can be parts of y and partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if z is larger than x and both are parts of y.
5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if z is larger than x, x is completely inside z, and z is a part of y.
6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible if x is larger than z and both are parts of y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if x is larger than z, z is completely inside x, and both are parts of y.
8. EQ(x,z): This is possible if x and z are the same region and both are parts of y.

Actually, wait. I just realized I've been making a conceptual error. Given TPPi(y,z), it doesn't mean TPP(z,y). Rather, it means TPP(y,z). The naming TPPi in the RCC-8 relations is a bit misleading because it suggests an inverse, but what's meant is actually the converse relation.

So, TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is part of z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Given the corrected understanding:
1. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

So, we know that x is part of y, and y is part of z. By transitivity of the "part of" relation, x is part of z.

Now, given that x is part of z, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

But which one is it? It depends on whether x touches the boundary of z.

Given TPP(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. Given TPPi(y,z), y touches the boundary of z. So, does x touch the boundary of z?

If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x would also touch the boundary of z, resulting in TPP(x,z).

If, however, x touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x would not touch the boundary of z, resulting in NTPP(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible.

But actually, I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me try to visualize and reason more carefully.

Actually, for RCC-8 relations, the converse of TPP is TPPi. That is, TPP(x,y) is the same as TPPi(y,x). So, given TPPi(y,z), we can conclude TPP(z,y).

But that can't be right. If y is a proper part of z, it doesn't make sense for z to also be a proper part of y.

Let me revisit the exact definition from the problem again:

- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, indeed, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). But, again, if y is a proper part of z, it doesn't make sense for z to also be a proper part of y.

Wait, I'm misreading again. Let's be careful here.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (inverse relationship). This means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

OK, so now we can identify that I was wrongly interpreting TPPi. TPPi(y,z) does NOT mean TPP(z,y). Rather, it means the converse of TPP, which would be that y is a tangential proper part of z.

So, with this understanding:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, given that x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, we know that x is a proper part of z. However, we need to determine if x touches the boundary of z.

If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of z, then x does not touch the boundary of z, resulting in NTPP(x,z).

If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y also touches the boundary of z, then x would also touch the boundary of z, resulting in TPP(x,z).

Let's see if there's a way to definitively determine which one is correct.

Actually, I need to be a bit more precise in how I'm thinking about this. Let's step back and consider some basic properties:

1. If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x touches the boundary of y at some point.
2. If y is a tangential proper part of z (TPPi(y,z)), then y touches the boundary of z at some point.

Now, if x touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of z, it doesn't necessarily mean that x touches the boundary of z. It depends on the specific regions.

For instance, consider three concentric circles: x is the innermost, y is the middle one, and z is the outermost. Here, TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) hold, but NTPP(x,z) holds because x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

On the other hand, if we have three circles where x is inside y, y is inside z, and x is positioned such that it touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) holds.

So, both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Hmm, actually, I just realized that I misread the problem statement. After revisiting it, TPPi(y,z) is "the same as TPP(z,y)". But this would contradict our usual understanding of the transitivity of "part of," since it would mean that both y is part of z and z is part of y.

So, let's look carefully at the descriptions again.

- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given these:
1. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPP(z,y): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect (they touch but don't overlap).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

All of these are possible.

Hmm, but I'm still not sure if that's right. Let's make one more pass. I want to make sure I'm understanding the definitions in the problem.

- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. 
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. 
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). 
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x). 

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we have:
1. x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, both x and z are parts of y. The possible relations between x and z would be:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are disjoint parts of y.
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This is possible if x and z touch but don't overlap.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if some part of x is in z and some part of x is outside of z, and similarly for z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z and touches its boundary, and z is also a part of y.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z, not touching its boundary, and z is also a part of y.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is the converse of TPP, so z is inside x and touches its boundary, and x is also a part of y.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x, not touching its boundary, and x is also a part of y.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is possible if x and z represent the same region, and both are parts of y.

All eight RCC-8 relations between x and z are consistent with the given constraints.

Actually, let me carefully check this once more.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means the inverse of TPP for y and z. That is, it means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given these, both x and z are proper parts of y, and both touch y's boundary.

For the RCC-8 relations, all eight are possible for the relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me check again to make sure I'm not forgetting anything.

Given:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given that both x and z are proper parts of y, the possible relationships between x and z would be:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means x and z have no common points. This is possible when both x and z are in y but do not overlap or touch.
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This means the boundaries of x and z touch, but their interiors do not intersect. This is possible when both x and z are in y and their boundaries touch.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means some part of x is in z, and some part of x is outside of z (and vice versa). This is possible when both x and z are in y and they partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and z is inside y.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z, not touching its boundary, and z is inside y.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and x is inside y.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x, not touching its boundary, and x is inside y.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means x and z represent the same region, and both are inside y.

All of these are possible.

Actually, let me double check that we don't have any constraints from TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). Specifically, I need to be sure I'm understanding TPPi(y,z) correctly.

TPPi(y,z) is defined as the same as TPP(z,y). So, TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since the problem only gives us these constraints, any of the eight RCC-8 relations could describe the relationship between x and z. They are all possible.

Let's double-check once more. The RCC-8 relations are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z overlap, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

We have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's check each RCC-8 relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected given the constraints? Yes, they can be disconnected as long as both are inside y and touch y's boundary.
2. EC(x,z): Can x and z externally connect (touch)? Yes, they can touch if both are inside y, touch y's boundary, and also touch each other.
3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can overlap if both are inside y, touch y's boundary, and also overlap each other without either being completely inside the other.
4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, this is possible if x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, this is possible if x is inside z without touching z's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, this is possible if z is inside x, touches x's boundary, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, this is possible if z is inside x without touching x's boundary, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be coincident (equal)? Yes, this is possible if x and z are the same region, and both are inside y and touch y's boundary.

All eight relations are consistent with the given constraints.

Actually, wait, I think I misunderstood TPPi. Let me now be even more precise.

The problem description says TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). 

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

But TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y. That means, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

I think I was correct all along. Let me finalize my answer.

Given:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

The possible relationships between x and z using the RCC-8 relations are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z overlap, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

All eight relations are possible given the constraints.

Wait, actually, there's something conceptually wrong here. The problem says:

"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

This means that TPPi is the inverse of TPP. So, if TPP(x,y) means "x is a tangential proper part of y", then TPPi(y,z) would mean "y is a tangential proper part of z". 

But I just said that TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which would mean "z is a tangential proper part of y". This is contradictory.

Let me reconsider the definitions.

"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary."
"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

So, TPP(y,x) means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary. And since TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), TPPi(x,y) also means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

Given TPPi(y,z), we can infer that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

So, we have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Given that x is part of y and y is part of z, by the transitivity of the "part of" relation, x is part of z. The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

Given that x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, it's not immediately clear whether x touches the boundary of z. It depends on the specific positions.

I think the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). But let's check again.

OK, I think we're getting lost in the notation. Let me go back to the beginning.

In the RCC-8 calculus:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That means that x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of TPP.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That means that x is properly contained in y and does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of NTPP.

So, TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Now, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. That is, z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Given these constraints, both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since both x and z are proper parts of y, there are several possibilities: x and z can be disjoint, they can touch, they can overlap, one can be a part of the other, or they can be identical.

Let's go through the RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are disjoint parts of y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if a part of x is in z and a part of x is outside of z, and a part of z is in x and a part of z is outside of x.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is contained in z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible.

Actually, let me just double-check this with a few examples to make sure the answer is consistent with the constraints. I'll consider some common shapes like circles:

1. DC(x,z): Let y be a large circle, x be a small circle touching the boundary of y on the left, and z be another small circle touching the boundary of y on the right. Then x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): Let y be a large circle, x and z be two small circles touching the boundary of y and also touching each other.
3. PO(x,z): Let y be a large circle, x and z be overlapping circles that both touch the boundary of y.
4. TPP(x,z): Let y be a large circle, z be a smaller circle touching the boundary of y, and x be an even smaller circle placed such that it touches both the boundary of z and the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,z): Let y be a large circle, z be a smaller circle touching the boundary of y, and x be an even smaller circle inside z but not touching the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): Let y be a large circle, x be a smaller circle touching the boundary of y, and z be an even smaller circle placed such that it touches both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Let y be a large circle, x be a smaller circle touching the boundary of y, and z be an even smaller circle inside x but not touching the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): Let y be a circle, and x and z be the same circle inside y, both touching the boundary of y.

All of these examples satisfy TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), and cover all eight RCC-8 relations. So, the answer is that all eight relations are possible.

Actually, let me reread the problem statement once more. The key thing I want to check is if TPPi(y,z) really means that z is a tangential proper part of y (as I've been assuming), or if it means that y is a tangential proper part of z (which would be the regular reading, given the "i" for "inverse").

The problem states:
"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

So, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). This means that TPPi(y,z) implies that z is a tangential proper part of y.

OK, so I think I have been correctly interpreting the notation. I just needed to double-check it because TPPi being the inverse of TPP should mean that y is a part of x, not the other way around (as I had mistaken it earlier).

With this clarification, my analysis above stands. All eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, let me make sure that the problem statement is being consistent. 

The problem says:
"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary."
"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

Based on this, TPPi(y,z) should be the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

But it also says:
"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary."
"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) should be the same as NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Both TPPi and NTPPi seem to be defined as the inverse of TPP and NTPP, respectively.

So, I think my interpretation was correct. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. All eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z.

Finally, let's double-check against the RCC-8 compositoin table. 

Looking at the RCC-8 composition table for TPP(x,y) ∘ TPPi(y,z), we want the entry for the composition of TPP and TPPi (let's denote their intersection as ∩).

The composition table gives us:
TPP(x,y) ∘ TPPi(y,z) = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}

This confirms that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Wait, I need to be careful here. What I'm referring to with the composition table is different. I don't have a composition table readily available, but based on known properties of RCC-8, all eight relations should be possible.

But to be even more sure, let's reason through some examples:

1. DC(x,z): Let y be a disk, x and z be two smaller disks inside y, both touching the boundary of y. If x and z are placed at opposite sides of y, they can be disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): With the same setup, if x and z are placed such that they touch each other without overlapping, we get EC(x,z).
3. PO(x,z): With the same setup, if x and z are placed such that they overlap partially, we get PO(x,z).
4. TPP(x,z): Let y be a disk, z be a smaller disk inside y touching its boundary, and x be an even smaller disk inside z touching both the boundary of z and the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,z): Let y be a disk, z be a smaller disk inside y touching its boundary, and x be an even smaller disk inside z not touching the boundary of z, but touching the boundary of y.
6. TPPi(x,z): This is the converse of TPP, so it's similar to the TPP example but with the roles of x and z swapped.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This is the converse of NTPP, so it's similar to the NTPP example but with the roles of x and z swapped.
8. EQ(x,z): Let y be a disk, and x and z be the same disk inside y, both touching the boundary of y.

These examples demonstrate that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, I think my example for NTPP(x,z) is wrong. Let's redo it:

5. NTPP(x,z): Let y be a disk, z be a smaller disk inside y touching its boundary, and x be an even smaller disk completely inside z (not touching the boundary of z). Since x is inside z and z is inside y, x is also inside y. Moreover, if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, it's not guaranteed that x touches the boundary of y. But since we're given TPP(x,y), we know x touches the boundary of y. This scenario seems inconsistent.

Ugh, this doesn't work, right?

Actually, let me try a different approach, by thinking about this more abstractly.

Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper subset of y, and x touches the boundary of y.

Given TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y), we know that z is a proper subset of y, and z touches the boundary of y.

So, both x and z are proper subsets of y, and both touch the boundary of y.

For the RCC-8 relation between x and z, all eight are possible. Let's verify each:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are disjoint, which can happen if they are at opposite sides of y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch but don't overlap. This is possible if x and z touch at a point or along a boundary, which can happen if they are positioned such that they touch each other.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if a part of x is in z and a part of x is outside of z (and vice versa), which can happen if they are positioned such that they overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible if x is contained in z and touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible if x is contained completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. This doesn't contradict TPP(x,y) because even if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, it can still touch the boundary of y (through z).
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x and touches the boundary of x. This is the converse of TPP, so it's possible if z is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is the converse of NTPP, so it's possible if z is contained completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. This doesn't contradict TPPi(y,z) for the same reason as NTPP(x,z).
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. This is possible if x and z represent the same region.

So all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, let me recheck the NTPP case, since I was confused before. Here's a concrete geometric example for NTPP:

5. NTPP(x,z): Let y be a large disk with a small indentation at the top. Let x be a small disk entirely contained within the indentation, such that x touches the boundary of y. Let z be the disk consisting of the whole indentation. Then z is a tangential proper part of y, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are both satisfied.

OK, I think this example works (though it requires thinking a bit outside the box).

For completeness, let me provide a similar example for NTPPi:

7. NTPPi(x,z): Let y be a large disk with a small indentation at the top. Let z be a small disk entirely contained within the indentation, such that z touches the boundary of y. Let x be the disk consisting of the whole indentation. Then x is a tangential proper part of y, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are both satisfied.

Hmm, actually, upon further reflection, I'm not quite satisfied with the examples for NTPPi and NTPP. Let's try again.

Actually, given our RCC-8 understanding, I think I can make a conceptually cleaner example. I'll use 2D shapes for visualization.

For NTPP(x,z):
Let y be a larger square. Let z be a circle inside this square, touching its boundary. Let x be a smaller circle inside z, not touching the boundary of z, but positioned such that it does touch the boundary of y (this is possible if the boundary of y "cuts through" z). Then, TPP(x,y) holds (x is a proper part of y and touches its boundary), TPPi(y,z) holds (z is a proper part of y and touches its boundary), and NTPP(x,z) also holds (x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch its boundary).

Actually I'm realizing now that this scenario is paradoxical. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, and z is entirely contained within y, then x cannot possibly touch the boundary of y.

Let's think about this differently.

Let's use "contained in" to mean either tangential proper part or non-tangential proper part.

Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is contained in y and touches the boundary of y.

Given TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y), we know that z is contained in y and touches the boundary of y.

So, both x and z are contained in y and both touch the boundary of y.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- x and z can be disjoint (DC).
- x and z can touch (EC).
- x and z can partially overlap (PO).
- x can be contained in z and touch the boundary of z (TPP).
- x can be contained in z and not touch the boundary of z (NTPP).
- z can be contained in x and touch the boundary of x (TPPi).
- z can be contained in x and not touch the boundary of x (NTPPi).
- x and z can be the same (EQ).

But there's a logical constraint: if x is contained in z, and z is contained in y, then x is also contained in y. Similarly, if z is contained in x, and x is contained in y, then z is also contained in y. These are consistent with our given constraints.

Now, given TPP(x,y), we have that x touches the boundary of y.
Given TPPi(y,z), we have that z touches the boundary of y.

If x doesn't touch the boundary of z but is inside z, and z is inside y, then x shouldn't be able to touch the boundary of y (since it would have to go through z). This contradicts TPP(x,y). Similarly, if z doesn't touch the boundary of x but is inside x, and x is inside y, then z shouldn't be able to touch the boundary of y. This contradicts TPPi(y,z).

So, it seems like NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible. The possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let's reconsider. RCC-8 is about regions and their boundaries. Maybe I'm confused with the semantics. Let me be more precise.

Imagine a larger bounding region representing y, which has an indentation. Both x and z can be regions inside y that touch the boundary of y. If z encompasses the indentation and extends further into y, and x is entirely within the indentation, then x would be inside z, but x would also touch the boundary of y. In this setup, x doesn't touch the boundary of z, which gives us NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's think graphically. Let y be a disk with a dent. Let z be a smaller disk that fits within y and touches the boundary of y. The way z is positioned, it covers a part of the dent in y. Now, let x be an even smaller disk that fits within the dent in y, such that it touches the boundary of y but is entirely inside z. Since x is entirely inside z, but doesn't touch the boundary of z, we have NTPP(x,z).

In this scenario, both x and z touch the boundary of y, as required by TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). Additionally, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, giving us NTPP(x,z). This affirms the possibility of NTPP(x,z).

Given the symmetry of the problem, we can similarly reason for NTPPi(x,z).

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, hmm, I haven't been considering RCC-8 for arbitrary regions. I've been thinking too much in terms of simple shapes. In RCC-8, we can consider arbitrary regions.

Let's use the more formal terminology of RCC-8: we represent regions as sets of points. A region is a set of points that is both regular closed and connected. A regular closed region is a region that has no "strands" or "points" (formally, it is the closure of its interior).

Let me define a specific set of regions for our problem, to allow for all our possibilities, even the NTPP and NTPPi cases.

Let's consider the universe of discourse to be a 2D plane. Let R(y) be a region representing y. It doesn't have to be a simple shape; it can have complex boundaries.

Let's say R(y) has a "bay" or an "indentation", and let's denote the region of this bay as B.

Now, let's define R(z) as a region that's a proper part of R(y) and touches the boundary of R(y). We'll place R(z) such that it includes the bay B, and also extends further into R(y).

Next, let's define R(x) as a region inside the bay B, such that it touches the boundary of R(y) (which is possible since the bay is an indentation into R(y)), but is entirely inside R(z) and doesn't touch the boundary of R(z).

With these definitions, we have:
- TPP(x,y): R(x) is a tangential proper part of R(y) since it's entirely inside R(y) and touches the boundary of R(y).
- TPPi(y,z): R(z) is a tangential proper part of R(y) since it's entirely inside R(y) and touches the boundary of R(y).
- NTPP(x,z): R(x) is a non-tangential proper part of R(z) since it's entirely inside R(z) and doesn't touch the boundary of R(z).

This demonstrates that NTPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relation between x and z given the constraints. By symmetry, we can similarly demonstrate the possibility of NTPPi(x,z).

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

OK, this time I'm confident in my answer, and I think an error I was making before is not considering complex regions, which are essential for RCC-8 to cover all spatial relations.

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), all eight RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible for the relationship between x and z.

The answer is DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

I need to analyze the relationship between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (since TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y))

So both x and z are proper parts of y, and both touch y's boundary. Let me analyze all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x and z are disjoint parts of y (like two separate circles inside y, both touching y's boundary).

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap (like two circles inside y that touch each other, and both touch y's boundary).

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z partially overlap (like two overlapping circles inside y, both touching y's boundary).

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary (and both touch y's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible with complex regions - imagine y has an indentation, z covers this indentation plus more of y, and x is in the indentation touching y's boundary but completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary (and both touch y's boundary).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to case 5, but with x and z roles reversed.

8. EQ(x,z): This is possible if x and z are identical regions inside y.
