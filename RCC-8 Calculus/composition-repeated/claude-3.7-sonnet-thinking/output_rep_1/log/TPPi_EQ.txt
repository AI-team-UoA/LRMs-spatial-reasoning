PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We're given that:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they are the same region.

Now I need to determine what relation holds between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are the same. Therefore, any relation that holds between y and x would also hold between z and x.

Given TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x. 

If we reverse the order of x and y in TPPi(x,y), we get TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.

Now, since EQ(y,z), z is the same as y. So, z is also a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of x. This means TPP(z,x) holds.

Again, if we reverse the order of z and x in TPP(z,x), we get TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this. 

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x (and specifically, y touches the boundary of x).
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same region.

So, if y is a proper part of x and y is the same as z, then z is also a proper part of x. And if y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

But wait, let me re-verify my understanding:

TPPi(x,y) actually means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.

So, if y is a tangential proper part of x and y is the same as z, then z is also a tangential proper part of x.

So, the relation between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I'm running in circles here a bit. Let me be more precise in my reasoning.

TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, with the "i" standing for "inverse". This is the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same region.

Given that y and z are the same region, any spatial relation that holds between y and any other region, like x, would also hold between z and that region.

So, if TPPi(x,y) holds, which means y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is the same as z, then z is also a tangential proper part of x. This can be expressed as TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be extremely careful here to avoid confusion.

According to the definitions provided:

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) means the same as TPP(y,x), which is that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (the same region).

So, given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region.

Since y and z are the same region, any relation that holds between y and any other region would also hold between z and that region.

So, if y is part of x and touches x's boundary, and y is the same as z, then z is also part of x and touches x's boundary. This is expressed as TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I'm being inconsistent. Let me clarify once more:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (the inverse of TPP).
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same region.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region.

Since y and z are the same region, any relation that holds between y and any other region would also hold between z and that region.

So, if y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is the same as z, then z is also a tangential proper part of x. This is expressed as TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Alright, I think the correct answer is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me review the definition of TPPi one more time, especially given the note in the prompt:

"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

This means that TPPi(x,y) indicates that x is the container and y is the contained region, and specifically, y touches the boundary of x.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region.

Since y and z are the same region, any relation that holds between y and any other region would also hold between z and that region.

So, if y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is the same as z, then z is also a tangential proper part of x. This is expressed as TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check my logic. We know:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are the same region.

Since y and z are the same region, any properties or relations that apply to y would also apply to z.

Given that y is contained in x and touches the boundary of x, and y is the same as z, it follows that z is also contained in x and touches the boundary of x. This relation is expressed as TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what these relations mean and how they compose:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they are the same spatial region.

Given these two facts, I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), any spatial relationship that holds between y and x must also hold between z and x.

We know that y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)). Therefore, z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

This means the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).
