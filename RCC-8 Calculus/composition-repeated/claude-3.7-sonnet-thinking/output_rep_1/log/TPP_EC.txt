PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think this through step by step.

We know:
1. TPP(x,y) - which means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.
2. EC(y,z) - which means that y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap.

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z, which could be any of the RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Let's analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   Since x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), x touches the boundary of y. And since y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), y and z touch at their boundaries. If x doesn't touch the boundary of y at the same place where y touches z, then x and z would be disconnected (DC(x,z)). This scenario is certainly possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are externally connected?
   If x touches the boundary of y at the same place where y touches z, then x and z could be externally connected (EC(x,z)). This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   This would mean that x and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other. Since x is a tangential proper part of y and y is externally connected to z, the only way x and z could share a common part is if x extends beyond the boundary of y into z. But this contradicts the fact that x is a proper part of y. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean that x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. Since x is a tangential proper part of y and y is externally connected to z, x being completely contained in z would mean that y and z overlap, which contradicts EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean that x is completely contained in the interior of z. This contradicts EC(y,z) even more strongly than TPP(x,z) does. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean that z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Since y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), and x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), z being completely contained in x would mean that z is also contained in y, contradicting EC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean that z is completely contained in the interior of x. This contradicts EC(y,z) even more strongly than TPPi(x,z) does. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   This would mean that x and z occupy exactly the same space. Since x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), and y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), if x and z were equal, it would mean that y and z overlap, contradicting EC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, from the analysis above, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected.

Let me double-check this by thinking through some concrete examples.

Imagine y as a circle. Since TPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary, so x could be a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at one point. Now, since EC(y,z), z is a another region that touches y's boundary from the outside.

If x touches y's boundary at the same point where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would be externally connected (EC(x,z)).

If x touches y's boundary at a different point from where z touches y's boundary, then x and z would be disconnected (DC(x,z)).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually let me think about this more carefully. Let's denote the boundary of a region r as ∂r, and the interior of a region as r°.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x ⊂ y and ∂x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅
- EC(y,z): y° ∩ z° = ∅ and y ∩ z ≠ ∅

Let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x ∩ z = ∅
   This is possible if x does not touch y at any point where y touches z.

2. EC(x,z): x° ∩ z° = ∅ and x ∩ z ≠ ∅
   This is possible if x touches y at some point where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): x° ∩ z° ≠ ∅, x \setminus z ≠ ∅, and z \setminus x ≠ ∅
   For this to be true, some part of the interior of x must overlap with the interior of z. But since x is a proper part of y and y and z are externally connected, the interiors of y and z do not overlap. So, the interior of x (which is a subset of the interior of y) cannot overlap with the interior of z. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x ⊂ z and ∂x ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅
   For this to be true, x must be a subset of z and the boundary of x must touch the boundary of z. Since x is a proper part of y, if x were also a proper part of z, then y and z would have to overlap, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x ⊂ z and ∂x ∩ ∂z = ∅
   Similar to the reasoning for TPP, this would require y and z to overlap, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z ⊂ x and ∂z ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅
   For this to be true, z would have to be a subset of x, which means z would also be a subset of y (since x is a subset of y). This contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z ⊂ x and ∂z ∩ ∂x = ∅
   Similar to the reasoning for TPPi, this would require z to be a subset of y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x = z
   If x and z were equal, then z would be a proper part of y, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, from this detailed analysis, we confirm that the only possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me re-examine option 3, PO(x,z), as I think I made an error. PO(x,z) means that x and z partially overlap, with neither being a part of the other.

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), x is entirely contained within y but touches y's boundary. And if y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), y and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap.

Now, for x and z to partially overlap (PO(x,z)), some part of x must be in z, and some part of z must be in x, and neither is completely contained in the other. But since x is entirely within y and y's interior doesn't overlap with z's interior, x's interior can't overlap with z's interior either. This means that PO(x,z) is still not possible.

Actually, I think I was not careful enough. Let me reconsider the PO(x,z) relationship. For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Given TPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap.

If x touches the boundary of y at a place where y touches z, and if part of x extends beyond this boundary point into z, then x and z would partially overlap. However, this contradicts the fact that x is a proper part of y, because if part of x extends into z, then that part of x would be outside of y, which contradicts TPP(x,y).

Actually, wait. The definition of TPP(x,y) states that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. It doesn't state that x can't extend beyond y's boundary. But I'm misunderstanding the definition; if x is a proper part of y, then x is entirely contained within y. If x were to extend beyond y's boundary, then x would not be a proper part of y. So, my reasoning remains correct: PO(x,z) is not possible.

To clarify once more: The definition of TPP(x,y) is "x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary". A proper part means that x is entirely contained within y, so no part of x can extend beyond y's boundary.

DC and EC remain the only possible relations between x and z. If x touches y's boundary at the exact same location where y touches z, then EC(x,z). Otherwise, DC(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more careful. I will interpret the definitions of RCC-8 relations as precisely as possible.

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, meaning they don't share any points.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, meaning they share some common part, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained in y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, which is the inverse of TPP.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is the inverse of NTPP.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal, occupying the same space.

Now, given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's reason through each potential relation:

1. DC(x,z): For x and z to be disconnected, they must not share any points. This is possible if x is touching y's boundary at a different point than where y is touching z.

2. EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, they must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. This is possible if x is touching y's boundary at the same point where y is touching z.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they must share some interior points, but neither can be entirely contained in the other. Since x is entirely contained in y and y and z don't share interior points, it's impossible for x and z to share interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely contained in z and touch z's boundary. Since x is entirely contained in y and y and z only touch at their boundaries, x cannot be entirely contained in z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely contained in the interior of z. Since y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't overlap, and x is entirely contained in y, x cannot be entirely contained in the interior of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely contained in x and touch x's boundary. Since z and y are externally connected and x is a proper part of y, z cannot be entirely contained in x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely contained in the interior of x. Since z and y are externally connected and x is a proper part of y, z cannot be entirely contained in the interior of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they must occupy the same space. Since x is a proper part of y and y and z are externally connected, x and z cannot occupy the same space. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this problem a bit more, to make sure my reasoning is rigorous.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y, and the topological closures of x and y share at least one point.
- EC(y,z): y and z do not have common interiors, but the topological closures of y and z share at least one point.

Let's analyze in detail the most relevant RCC-8 relations for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): The topological closures of x and z don't share any point. This is possible if x is within y but doesn't touch the same boundary as where y touches z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z don't have common interiors, but their topological closures share at least one point. This is possible if x touches y's boundary at the exact same location where y touches z. Here, the topological closures of x and z would share that boundary point, but their interiors would remain separate.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share common interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. Since x is entirely inside y, and y's interior doesn't overlap with z's interior (because of EC(y,z)), x's interior can't overlap with z's interior. Therefore, PO(x,z) is impossible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and the topological closures of x and z share at least one point. This would mean that the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z. But since x is entirely inside y, and the interiors of y and z don't overlap, the interior of x can't be a subset of the interior of z. So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and the topological closures of x and z don't share any point. This is even more restricted than TPP(x,z) and is thus impossible as well.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and the topological closures of z and x share at least one point. Since z touches y externally, z can't be entirely inside y. Since x is a proper subset of y, z can't be a proper subset of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and the topological closures of z and x don't share any point. This is even more restricted than TPPi(x,z) and is thus impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same set. Since x is a proper subset of y, and z touches y externally, they can't be the same set. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

This concludes that the only possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me make a minor clarification on EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means x and z are "externally connected", which means they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. For this to happen, x must touch the boundary of y at the exact same location where y touches z. In this scenario, x and z would share a point in their boundaries, but their interiors would remain separate.

To give a concrete example, imagine y as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside y that touches y's boundary at a point p, and z as another disk outside y that also touches y's boundary at the point p. Here, x and z would touch at the point p, making EC(x,z) true.

On the other hand, if x touches y's boundary at a different point than where y touches z, then x and z would be completely separated, making DC(x,z) true.

So, the only possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

To summarize:
1. DC(x,z) is possible when x touches y's boundary at a different location from where y touches z.
2. EC(x,z) is possible when x touches y's boundary at the exact same location where y touches z.

All other RCC-8 relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible between x and z.

The answer is: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z). I stated that for TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper subset of z, and the topological closures of x and z must share at least one point. I then stated that the interior of x would have to be a subset of the interior of z, which would contradict EC(y,z). But I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this correctly. Let me reconsider.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then x must be entirely contained within z, including its interior. However, given that:
1. x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), so x is entirely contained in y.
2. y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), so they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.

It's impossible for x, which is entirely inside y, to also be entirely inside z, since y and z don't share interior points. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible because it requires x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is entirely contained in the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, since y and z don't share interior points, and x is inside y, x cannot be inside the interior of z.

So, my conclusion remains unchanged: the only possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), I'll analyze what these conditions tell us:

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (fully contained within y)
- x touches y's boundary

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z have no interior overlap

Now let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary at a different location than where y touches z. In this case, x and z would have no spatial connection.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary exactly where y touches z. In this scenario, x and z would touch at their boundaries but not overlap.

3. PO(x,z): Not possible. Since x is fully contained in y, and y and z don't share interior points, x and z cannot partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. This would require x to be fully inside z, but since x is inside y and y only touches z at the boundary, x cannot be contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. This would require z to be fully inside x, but z is not contained in y, and x is inside y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since x is a proper part of y and y is only externally connected to z, x and z cannot be equal.
