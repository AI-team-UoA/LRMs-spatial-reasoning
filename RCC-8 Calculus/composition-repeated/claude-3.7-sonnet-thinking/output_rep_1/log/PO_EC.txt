PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

This question is asking for the composition of spatial relations. Specifically, we want to know the possible relations between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's consider what each of these relations means:

- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is contained in the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts.

Now, let's think about what these two relations together tell us about the possible relations between x and z. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is externally connected to z, we need to consider different possible configurations.

The possible relations between x and z are the following:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be disconnected if the part of x that overlaps with y is not the part of y that touches z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected if the part of x that overlaps with y includes the boundary of y that touches z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap if x extends into z beyond the boundary where y and z touch.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z if x is completely contained within the interior of z.

However, I need to check if all of these are actually possible given the constraints.

Let's reason through this step by step:

Given that PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some interior points, but not all of x is in y and not all of y is in x.

Given that EC(y,z), we know that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

DC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y does not reach the boundary where y touches z. In this case, x and z are completely separated.

EC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y extends to the boundary where y touches z, but does not go beyond into z. In this case, x and z touch at a boundary.

PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x extends beyond the boundary of y where y touches z and into z. In this case, x and z would share some interior points.

TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained in z and touch the boundary of z. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, it's not immediately clear if this is possible. Let's think...

Actually, I don't think TPP(x,z) is possible. If x is a proper part of z (TPP), then all of x is inside z. But we're given that PO(x,y), so part of x is inside y. And given EC(y,z), y and z don't share any interior points. This means that if part of x is inside y, that part can't be inside z. So, x can't be completely inside z, which means TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): Similarly, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained in the interior of z. But as we just reasoned, if part of x is inside y, that part can't be inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, all of z would be inside x, and z would touch the boundary of x. Given EC(y,z), z touches y at the boundary. Now, since PO(x,y), part of x is outside y. It's possible that z is entirely contained in that part of x that's outside y. But we need to check more carefully. Actually, given PO(x,y), some interior points of x are in y. And given EC(y,z), interior points of z cannot be in y. So, for TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be inside x but outside y. This seems possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, all of z would be inside the interior of x. Using similar reasoning as above, z would need to be inside the interior of x but outside y (except potentially touching y at the boundary). This seems possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, then either both overlap with y or both don't. Since PO(x,y), x overlaps with y. But given EC(y,z), z only touches y at the boundary and doesn't overlap with it. This contradiction suggests that EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me check my reasoning once more, particularly for TPPi and NTPPi:

Actually, let's reconsider TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). For TPPi(x,z), z needs to be inside x and touch the boundary of x. Additionally, given EC(y,z), z touches y at their boundary. Now, for TPPi(x,z) to be true, all of z must be inside x. But given that z touches y at its boundary, and PO(x,y) implies that not all of x is inside y, it's not clear if all of z can be inside x.

Let's think about it geometrically. Imagine y and z as two regions that touch at their boundary. Now, imagine x as a region that partially overlaps with y. Specifically, part of x is inside y, and part of x is outside y. Now, can z be entirely inside x? If z is on the same side of y as the part of x that's outside y, and if x extends far enough, then z can indeed be entirely inside x.

So, TPPi(x,z) seems possible if the part of x that's outside y encompasses all of z.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z needs to be in the interior of x. If the part of x that's outside y is large enough, then z can be in the interior of x (not touching the boundary of x). So, NTPPi(x,z) also seems possible.

Actually, wait a second. I might be making a mistake in this reasoning, because I didn't fully visualize the constraints properly:

Let's re-read the definitions:

- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Given that PO(x,y), x and y partially overlap. And given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would be a part of x and touch x's boundary. But given EC(y,z), z also touches y's boundary. For z to be a part of x, every point of z must be a point of x. But given the constraints, it's not clear if this is always achievable.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would be a part of x and not touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. For z to be a part of x without touching x's boundary, every point of z must be a point of x, and no point of z can be on the boundary of x.

Let me see if I can visualize a specific scenario to clarify:

---

Actually, wait, rather than trying to explicitly visualize one, let me try to draw some conclusions from the definitions.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This means that there's a part of x that's in y, a part of x that's not in y, a part of y that's in x, and a part of y that's not in x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means that there's a point on the boundary of both y and z, but all interior points of y are outside z, and all interior points of z are outside y.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z.

DC(x,z) means that x and z are disconnected. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y touches z at the boundary, if the part of x that's in y doesn't extend to the boundary where y touches z, then x and z could be disconnected.

EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at the boundary. If the part of x that's in y extends to the boundary where y touches z, then x and z could touch at the boundary.

PO(x,z) means that x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. For this to be true, some part of x must be in z, and some part of z must be in x. Given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), this is possible if some part of x extends beyond the boundary of y and into z.

TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, all of x must be inside z. But given PO(x,y), some part of x is inside y. And given EC(y,z), interior points of y are outside z. This means that the part of x that's inside y cannot be inside z, making TPP(x,z) impossible.

NTPP(x,z) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this is impossible because the part of x inside y cannot be inside z.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a part of x and touches x's boundary. For this to be true, all of z must be inside x. Given EC(y,z), z touches y at a boundary, but all interior points of z are outside y. Given PO(x,y), part of x is outside y. If z is positioned such that it's entirely within the part of x that's outside y (except for the boundary point where it touches y), then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This doesn't seem possible because z touches y at a boundary, and given PO(x,y), that boundary point might also be a boundary point of x (especially if the boundaries of x and y are aligned there).

EQ(x,z) means that x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, but PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), there's a contradiction: x partially overlaps with y, while z only touches y at the boundary.

Actually, I think NTPPi(x,z) is possible. Note that even though z touches y at a boundary, there's no requirement that z touches the boundary of x too. The part of x that's in y might not have the same boundary as y. So z could be inside the part of x that's not in y, and not touch the boundary of x.

Ok, let me reasess possible relations:

DC(x,z): Possible, if the part of x that's in y doesn't extend to the boundary where y and z touch.
EC(x,z): Possible, if the part of x that's in y extends to the boundary where y and z touch, but x doesn't extend into z.
PO(x,z): Possible, if part of x extends into z and part of z extends into x.
TPP(x,z): Not possible, as the part of x that's in y (which is non-empty due to PO(x,y)) cannot be in z (due to EC(y,z)).
NTPP(x,z): Not possible, for similar reasons as TPP.
TPPi(x,z): Possible, if z is within the part of x that's not in y (except for the boundary where z touches y). In this scenario, z is part of x and touches x's boundary at the same point where it touches y.
NTPPi(x,z): This one is a bit tricky. For NTPPi(x,z), z must be entirely within x but not touch the boundary of x. Given that z touches y, z must touch the part of x that overlaps with y. But if the boundary of x and y aren't exactly aligned at that point, it's possible for z to be inside x without touching the boundary of x. So, I think NTPPi(x,z) is possible.
EQ(x,z): Not possible, due to the contradiction: x partially overlaps with y while z only touches y at the boundary.

Actually, I'm still struggling with some of these. Let me reason through it once more explicitly.

Actually, I realize that I made an error in some of the earlier reasoning. When we say PO(x,y), we mean x and y share some interior points. So, the part of x that overlaps with y isn't just touching the boundary of y, but sharing interior points. Similarly, when we say EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let me reconsider the relationships one by one:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. It's possible for a region x to partially overlap with y, while z is externally connected to y in such a way that x and z don't share any points. If I can physically move x and z such that they don't touch and their relationship with y is still preserved (overlap and EC respectively), then DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. Following the same reasoning as above, I can have a region x partially overlapping with y and a region z externally connected to y, such that x and z touch only at a boundary. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Again, I can imagine a scenario where x partially overlaps with y, and z is externally connected to y, in such a way that x and z overlap spatially. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z. Given PO(x,y), some interior points of x are inside y. And given EC(y,z), y and z don't share any interior points. This seems to create a contradiction: the points of x inside y cannot simultaneously be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Following the same reasoning as for TPP, this relationship is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x. Given EC(y,z), all interior points of z are outside y. But given PO(x,y), some interior points of x are inside y. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be in the part of x that's not inside y. This is possible if z is positioned correctly.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is inside the interior of x. For this to be true, given EC(y,z), z must be inside the interior of x that's not inside y. I'm not entirely convinced this is possible, because z touches y at a boundary. Let's think more about this: z touches y at a boundary, and that boundary point is also a point of x (since x partially overlaps with y). But for NTPPi(x,z), z cannot touch the boundary of x. This suggests that NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. As we've reasoned before, this creates a contradiction with the given relationships. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Now, I still wonder if NTPPi(x,z) is possible. I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to understand this better with a spatial example...

Actually, let's think differently again. I'll reason through this from a different angle...

Let's keep the definitions in mind:

- PO(x,y): x and y share interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries, but don't share interior points.
- TPPi(x,z): z is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is fully inside the interior of x, not touching the boundary.

Given that PO(x,y), x has common interior points with y. And given EC(y,z), z touches the boundary of y but doesn't share interior points. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be fully inside the interior of x. But z touches the boundary of y, which could be coincident with the boundary of x (especially at the point where x, y, and z meet). If that's the case, then z would touch the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible, I think...

You know what I was failing to account for: I need to remember that PO(x,y) doesn't mean the boundary of x has to intersect with the boundary of y. It could be that x covers some of y (without touching the boundary where y and z touch), and some of y is outside x, and some of x is outside y. In this case, z may touch the boundary of y, but not the boundary of x.

Let me reconsider NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be entirely inside the interior of x. Given EC(y,z), z touches the boundary of y. If the boundary of y where z touches is also a boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible. But if the boundary of y where z touches is not a boundary of x, then z can be entirely inside the interior of x. This is possible, depending on the exact configuration.

So, based on the spatial configurations, here's my updated analysis:

DC(x,z): Possible.
EC(x,z): Possible.
PO(x,z): Possible.
TPP(x,z): Not possible.
NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
TPPi(x,z): Possible.
NTPPi(x,z): Possible, but depends on the specific configuration.
EQ(x,z): Not possible.

Actually, I'm still struggling with visualizing NTPPi(x,z). Let's consdier a simple 2D example: Imagine a setup with three disks: x, y, and z. Given PO(x,y), x and y partially overlap, meaning there's a region that's inside both. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at a point on their boundaries. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be entirely inside the interior of x. But z also touches the boundary of y at a point.

Let me try to visualize this in 2D by thinking about the positioning of the disks:

Disk y is in the middle. Disk z touches y at a point on its boundary. Disk x partially overlaps with y.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be inside the interior of x, and for EC(y,z) to be true, z must touch the boundary of y.

If x and y overlap, but the boundary of x doesn't exactly coincide with the boundary of y at the point where z touches y, then z can be inside the interior of x (satisfying NTPPi(x,z)) while also touching the boundary of y (satisfying EC(y,z)).

So, I think NTPPi(x,z) is possibly.

But let's double-check because the question is asking for all possible relations between x and z.

DC(x,z): Clearly possible. Imagine x is to the left of y, and z is to the right. Both conditions can be satisfied, and x can be disconnected from z.

EC(x,z): Clearly possible. Imagine x partially overlaps with y in such a way that it just reaches the boundary point where y and z touch. x and z would touch at that boundary point.

PO(x,z): Also seems possible. Imagine x partially overlaps with y and extends beyond the boundary of y into the region where z is. Then, x and z can partially overlap.

TPP(x,z): Not possible, as I've reasoned earlier. If x partially overlaps with y, and y and z only touch at a boundary (no interior overlap), then x can't be entirely inside z.

NTPP(x,z): Also not possible, for the same reason as TPP.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given EC(y,z), z touches the boundary of y. For TPPi(x,z) to be possible, the boundary point where z touches y must also be a boundary point of x. But given PO(x,y), the boundary of x doesn't have to coincide with the boundary of y. So, it's possible that z is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x at the same point where it touches the boundary of y.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely inside the interior of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. For this to be possible, given EC(y,z), the boundary point where z touches y shouldn't be a boundary point of x. This requires a specific configuration where the boundary of x and the boundary of y don't coincide at the point where z touches y.

EQ(x,z): Not possible, due to the contradiction I've reasoned through earlier.

Ok, it's still not completely clear to me whether or not TPPi(x,z) and NPPi(x,z) are possible, and I'm having a hard time doing the visualization. Let me actually try to draw some examples in 2D to convince myself of these confusions.

Let's think about a scenario where x and y are two disks that partially overlap, and z is a third disk that touches y externally at one point.

For TPPi(x,z), we want z to be fully inside x and touch the boundary of x. If z touches y at a point, and that point is a boundary point of x, then z would touch the boundary of x. This is TPPi(x,z). I'm trying to visualize this and it seems possible as long as z is properly positioned.

For NTPPi(x,z), we want z to be fully inside the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x. Given EC(y,z), z touches the boundary of y. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, the point where z touches y shouldn't be on the boundary of x. Actually, I'm coming around to thinking there's a topological issue with this. If z touches y at a point, and x and y overlap, then z is touching a part of the boundary of y that is within the region of overlap of x and y. This point, being in the overlap, is inside x. But since it's on the boundary of y, it should alo be in the boundary of x. So I wonder if z can touch the boundary of y without touching the boundary of x?

Hmm, actually it all comes down to specific assumptions about the boundary of the overlap. Let's reread the definition of PO(x,y) more specifically:

PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

This definition doesn't necessitate that the shared part includes boundary points. It's possible that the shared part is purely interior. In such a case, z touching the boundary of y wouldn't necessarily mean z is touching the boundary of x.

Let me be even more specific and consider a visualization: Imagine x as a disk with center A and y as a disk with center B. These disks partially overlap. Now, imagine z as a disk with center C, which is positioned such that it just touches the boundary of y but doesn't go inside y.

For TPPi(x,z), we want z to be fully inside x and touch the boundary of x. This is possible if z is positioned such that it's inside x, and the point of contact between z and y is also a boundary point of x.

For NTPPi(x,z), we want z to be fully inside the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x. This is possible if the point of contact between z and y is inside x but not on the boundary of x.

I think both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible, but they require specific configurations.

Let's check our reasoning once more:

For TPPi(x,z) to be true:
- z is entirely inside x.
- z touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true:
- z is entirely inside the interior of x.
- z does not touch the boundary of x.

Given EC(y,z):
- z touches the boundary of y.
- z has no interior points in common with y.

Given PO(x,y):
- x and y share some interior points.
- Neither x nor y is fully contained in the other.

For TPPi(x,z) to be compatible with the given constraints, z must be entirely inside x and touch the boundary of x. Meanwhile, z also touches the boundary of y. This is possible if the point of contact between z and y is also a boundary point of x.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be compatible, z must be entirely inside the interior of x, and the point of contact between z and y must be inside x but not on the boundary of x. The question is whether this is ever possible given that the point of contact is on the boundary of y and might be in the overlapping region of x and y.

Actually, let me think of a different scenario. Suppose we have three disks: x, y, and z. Let Disk y and Disk z be touching at a point P. Now, let Disk x be larger than both and positioned such that it contains both Disk y and Disk z entirely, except that Disk y has a part that extends beyond the boundary of Disk x. In this scenario:

- PO(x,y) is true because x and y overlap, but y has a part that's outside x.
- EC(y,z) is true because y and z touch at the point P.
- NTPPi(x,z) might also be true if the point P is inside the interior of x. But if P is on the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) wouldn't hold.

I think NTPPi(x,z) is possible in specific configurations. If the point of contact between y and z (point P) is inside the interior of x, then z can be entirely inside the interior of x without touching the boundary of x.

But I still feel like I'm missing something...Actually I think the issue is I have boundary vs interior mixed up in one of my steps.

Let me reconsider from first principles:

PO(x,y): This means x and y have common interior points, and each has interior points that the other doesn't. It doesn't say anything explicit about boundaries.

EC(y,z): This means y and z touch at a point on their boundaries, but don't share interior points. So, there's a point on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of z.

Now, let's visualize: y and z touch at a boundary point. x partially overlaps with y, so some interior points of x are in the interior of y, and vice versa. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be entirely inside the interior of x and not touch the boundary of x. 

Here's the insight I was missing: the overlapping of x and y doesn't say anything definitive about how their boundaries align. If the point of contact between y and z is at a place where the boundary of y is not aligned with the boundary of x, then z can be inside the interior of x without touching the boundary of x.

I'm becoming more confident that NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

However, let me try another sanity check with 2D regions. Suppose x and y are disks that partially overlap, and z is a disk that touches y at a single point. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, the entirety of z should be inside the interior of x. But z touches y at a point. If the boundary of x and the boundary of y are not aligned at that point, then it's possible for z to be inside the interior of x while still touching the boundary of y.

OK I ultimately think that both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible. It just depends on how the regions are positioned. The reasoning I've been doing in 2D can be generalized to arbitrary spatial regions.

So, my final list of possible relations, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

And the relations that are not possible are:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Alright. So given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze the constraints:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap - they share some interior points but neither is contained in the other
- EC(y,z): y and z externally connect - they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points

Considering all possible arrangements:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with y in a region away from where y touches z, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with y and extends just to the point where y touches z, then x and z can externally connect.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x extends beyond the boundary of y into z, they can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. Since x overlaps with y (so some of x is inside y), and y only touches z at the boundary (with no interior overlap), x cannot be completely contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If x is large enough to completely contain z while also partially overlapping with y, z can be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If x completely contains z in its interior while still partially overlapping with y, z can be a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since x partially overlaps y while z only externally connects with y, they cannot be equal.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
