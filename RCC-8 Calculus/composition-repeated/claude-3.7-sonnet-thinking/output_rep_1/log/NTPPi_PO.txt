PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

First, let's clarify what NTPPi(x,y) means. It means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary.

Next, let's clarify what PO(y,z) means. It means that y and z partially overlap. In other words, y and z share some common part, but neither is contained entirely within the other.

Now, let's think about what these two conditions together imply about the relationship between x and z.

We know that:
1. y is properly contained within x (NTPPi(x,y)).
2. y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)).

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But this is impossible because we know that y has a common part with z (due to PO(y,z)), and y is entirely within x (due to NTPPi(x,y)). So, x and z must share at least the common part of y and z, meaning they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Again, this is impossible for the same reason as DC(x,z). We know that y has a common part with z, and y is entirely within x, so x and z must share at least the common part of y and z as interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. If some parts of z are inside x (those that overlap with y) and some parts of z are outside x, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if all of x is contained within z, and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if all of x is contained within z, and x does not touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if all of z is contained within x, and z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if all of z is contained within x, and z does not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

But now I need to check if all of these possibilities are consistent with the given conditions. Let me go through them again.

1. DC(x,z): Ruled out already.

2. EC(x,z): Ruled out already.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Let's consider a specific example: x is a large circle, y is a small circle entirely within x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a circle that partially overlaps with y but also extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Is this possible? It would mean x is entirely contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. We also know that y is entirely contained within x, and y partially overlaps with z. Let's try to think of an example: x is a circle, y is a smaller circle entirely within x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a larger circle that properly contains x, with x touching z's boundary. But in this case, I'm not sure if y can still partially overlap with z, as it seems y would be properly contained within z as well... Let me think more about this.

Actually, TPP(x,z) might be possible. If y is inside x but closer to the boundary on one side, and z is a region that properly contains x (with x touching z's boundary), then it's possible for y to partially overlap with z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP(x,z), this would mean x is properly contained within z, and x does not touch z's boundary. Using similar reasoning, this seems possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is properly contained within x, and z touches x's boundary. We know that y is properly contained within x and does not touch x's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z. Let's think of an example: x is a large circle, y is a small circle entirely within x (not touching x's boundary), and z is another circle that partially overlaps with y and also touches x's boundary from the inside. This seems possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is properly contained within x, and z does not touch x's boundary. We know that y is also properly contained within x and does not touch x's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z. Let's think of an example: x is a large circle, y and z are smaller circles entirely within x (not touching x's boundary), and y and z partially overlap. This seems possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. We know that y is properly contained within x and does not touch x's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z. If x and z are the same region, then y would be properly contained within z as well, not partially overlapping with it. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check each of these by thinking about the logical implications more carefully:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as explained.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible, as explained.
3. PO(x,z): Possible, as explained.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible, as explained.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible, as explained.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, as explained.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, as explained.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x and z are the same region, then NTPPi(x,y) would imply NTPP(y,z), which contradicts PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Now, let me double-check these again with some additional reasoning:

1. PO(x,z): If y is a proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z, then it's certainly possible for x and z to partially overlap.

2. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then all of x is contained in z. But we also know that all of y is contained in x, so all of y is contained in z as well. But this contradicts our given condition that PO(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's reconsider TPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z) to be true, all of x must be contained in z, and x must touch z's boundary. Since all of y is contained in x (from NTPPi(x,y)), all of y must be contained in z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that y and z share some part, but neither is contained entirely within the other. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then all of x is contained in z. But this leads to the same contradiction as TPP(x,z) with our given condition PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, I need to revise my list:

1. PO(x,z): Possible, as explained.
2. TPP(x,z): Not possible, as just explained.
3. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, as just explained.
4. TPPi(x,z): Possible, as explained.
5. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, as explained.

I made a mistake again. Let me check more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), does it always contradicts the given conditions? I think I need to be more clear.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): This means y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is fully contained within the other.

Now, let's consider each relation:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then they share no common part. But since y is fully contained within x, and y shares a common part with z, then x and z must also share this common part. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts, then they share no interior common part. But since y is fully contained within x's interior (because it's a non-tangential part), and y shares an interior common part with z, then x and z must also share this interior common part. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then some part of x is not part of z, and some part of z is not part of x. Since y is fully contained within x, and y partially overlaps with z, then it's possible that some part of x (where y is not) is not part of z, and some part of z (where y is not overlapping) is not part of x. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then all of x is contained within z. Since y is fully contained within x, all of y is contained within z. But this contradicts our given condition that PO(y,z), which requires that some part of y is not within z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then all of x is contained within z, and the same contradiction arises. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then all of z is contained within x, and z touches x's boundary. We also know that y is fully contained within x's interior. Now, for PO(y,z) to be true, y and z must share a common part, but neither is fully contained within the other. Since z is fully contained within x and y is fully contained within x's interior, it's possible for y and z to share a common part within x. And since z touches x's boundary while y is away from x's boundary, neither is fully contained within the other. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then all of z is contained within x's interior. We also know that y is fully contained within x's interior. For PO(y,z) to be true, y and z must share a common part, but neither is fully contained within the other. It's possible for y and z to both be within x's interior, share a common part, but neither fully contains the other. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are coincident, then they are the same region. Since y is fully contained within x, y would also be fully contained within z. But this contradicts our given condition that PO(y,z), which requires that neither y nor z is fully contained within the other. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, let me double check TPPi(x,z). For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. All of z is within x.
2. z touches x's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,y) to be true, y must be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. All of y is within x.
2. y does not touch x's boundary.

For PO(y,z) to be true, y and z must partially overlap. This means:
1. y and z share a common part.
2. Some part of y is not within z.
3. Some part of z is not within y.

Given these conditions, can z be a tangential proper part of x? Well, if z touches x's boundary and all of z is within x, then it's possible that z and y overlap within x's interior, satisfying PO(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), if all of z is within x's interior, it's possible for z and y to overlap within x's interior, satisfying PO(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z), as I've already shown, it's consistent with the given conditions. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me triple-check this, just to be sure.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

Let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then they have no common part. But if y is fully within x and y overlaps with z, then x and z must have a common part. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z touch only at their boundaries, they don't share interior parts. But if y is within x's interior and y overlaps with z, then x and z must share interior parts. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they share some parts but not others. Given that y is within x and y overlaps with z, it's possible that x and z share the parts where y and z overlap, but not other parts. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then all of x is within z. Since y is within x, all of y is also within z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which requires that part of y is outside of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, all of x is within z's interior. Since y is within x, all of y is within z's interior, again contradicting PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, all of z is within x and z touches x's boundary. Since y is within x's interior, it's possible that y and z overlap within x but neither is fully within the other. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, all of z is within x's interior. It's possible that y and z overlap within x's interior but neither is fully within the other. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then z has the same boundaries as x. Since y is fully within x, y would also be fully within z, contradicting PO(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait, let's be a bit more careful about TPPi(x,z). If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches the boundary of x. But PO(y,z) implies that y and z share a common part, but neither is fully contained within the other. Given NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is fully within x's interior. It's possible that z extends from x's boundary into x's interior, where it overlaps with y. That's possible with PO(y,z) as long as part of z is not within y and part of y is not within z. So yes, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

What about NTPPi(x,z)? If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is fully within x's interior. Given that y is also fully within x's interior, it's possible that y and z overlap within x's interior but neither is fully within the other. So, NTPPi(x,z) is still possible too.

So, our final conclusion:
The possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Ah, just to be extra extra sure, let me reason from first principles one more time just to make sure I didn't get confused.

1. y is totally inside of x, that is, contained in its interior
2. y and z share at least some part, and neither is fully contained within the other.

Let's check each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? No. Because if y is inside x and y overlaps with z, then x and z share at least the part of y that overlaps with z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Is this possible? No. Because if y is inside x's interior and y overlaps with z, then x and z must share at least the interior part of y that overlaps with z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Is this possible? Yes, this is consistent with the given conditions.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this possible? If all of x is within z, then all of y is also within z. But PO(y,z) requires that part of y is outside of z, which is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similarly, if all of x is within z, then all of y is within z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? If all of z is within x, and y is within x's interior, then it's possible that y and z overlap within x without one being fully contained in the other. Also, it's possible that part of z touched the boundary of x, and part of z didn't. That is, TPPi(x,z) is still compatible with PO(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? If all of z is within x's interior, and y is also within x's interior, then it's possible that y and z overlap within x's interior without one being fully contained in the other, as would be required for PO(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. Is this possible? If x and z are the same, then since y is within x, y would also be within z. But PO(y,z) requires that part of y is outside of z, which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, our conclusion remains:
The possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what's possible between x and z given the constraints:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is fully inside x, not touching x's boundary)
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (they share some part, but neither is contained in the other)

Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible. Since y overlaps with z and y is inside x, x and z must share at least the overlapping portion.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible. Since y is in x's interior and overlaps with z, x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x and z can share the part where y and z overlap, while each has parts the other doesn't contain.

4. TPP(x,z) - Not possible. If x were inside z, then y would be fully inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting that y and z partially overlap.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible. Same reasoning as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be properly inside x and touch x's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) while still partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be inside z, contradicting partial overlap.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
