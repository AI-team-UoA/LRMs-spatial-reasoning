PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider what we know:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary.

So we have x inside y without touching y's boundary, and z inside y touching y's boundary. What could be the relationship between x and z?

I need to consider all the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are identical.

Given what we know, let's analyze each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any space. This is possible because even though both x and z are inside y, they can still be separate from each other within y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors. This is also possible. Both are within y, and they could be positioned so that they just touch.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. They could share some but not all of their spaces.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. Is this possible? Well, x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z touches y's boundary. Can x be inside z and touch z's boundary? Yes, if z extends further into y than x does, then x could be touching z's "inner" boundary while z touches y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible if z completely contains x with some space between x and z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. Is this possible? We know that z touches y's boundary while x doesn't. If z is inside x, then z touching y's boundary would mean x also touches y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary. Again, if z is inside x, and z touches y's boundary, then x must also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, and z touches y's boundary, then x must also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait. I've made a mistake in my reasoning. TPPi(y,z) does not mean that z is a tangential proper part of y. Rather, it means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So let's revisit our premises:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

So we have x inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary. What could be the relationship between x and z?

Since y is inside z and x is inside y, by transitivity, x must be inside z. But does x touch z's boundary? We know that x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary. This means x is "buffered" from z's boundary by y, so x can't touch z's boundary.

Given this clarification, let's reevaluate the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any space. But we've established that x is inside z, so they do share space. DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries. But we've established that x doesn't touch z's boundary, so EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. But we've established that x is completely inside z, not just partially. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. But we've established that x doesn't touch z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary. This alignment with our description: x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. But we've established that x is inside z, not the other way around. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary. But we've established that x is inside z, not the other way around. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. But we've established that x is inside z, not identical to it. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the only possible relationship between x and z seems to be NTPP(x,z), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me be 100% sure. If I know:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Then can I say with certainty that NTPP(x,z)? 

Since y is a tangential proper part of z, it means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, it means x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given those facts, can I definitively say that x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary?

x is definitely inside z because of containment transitivity: x inside y and y inside z implies x inside z.

Does x touch z's boundary? If y touches z's boundary at some point, and x is inside y without touching y's boundary, then x can't touch z's boundary at that point. But could there be another part of z's boundary that "dips in" and touches x? 

Actually, I think that's not possible. Let's see why. 

If a part of z's boundary were to touch x directly, then that part of z's boundary would have to pass through y (since x is completely contained in y). But if a part of z's boundary were to pass through y, it would contradict the fact that y is a proper part of z, as it would mean that y is not fully inside z. So, it's not possible for x to touch z's boundary.

This confirms that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Hmm, I think I made a mistake. Let's think about this more clearly.

We have:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is inside y, not touching y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

Can a part of z's boundary pass through y and touch x? No, that would contradict the fact that y is inside z. If a part of z's boundary went through y, then y would not be fully inside z.

So, x is inside z (because x is inside y and y is inside z) and doesn't touch z's boundary. This confirms NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I should be extra careful here and double-check. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. The question is, can x touch z's boundary given these constraints?

Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y with no part of x touching y's boundary. And since TPPi(y,z), y is inside z with y touching z's boundary. 

If y touches z's boundary at some points, but x doesn't touch any part of y's boundary, then x can't touch z's boundary at those points. The remaining concern is, could there be other parts of z's boundary that bypass y and touch x directly?

But if y is a proper part of z, there's no way for z's boundary to bypass y and touch x. The proper part relation (be it NTPP or TPP) means y is completely inside z, which means z's boundary surrounds y. Since x is completely inside y, x can never touch z's boundary.

So, again, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

On second thought, I'm still not entirely convinced. Let's use explicit spatial thinking.

Picture this: We have a region z. Inside it, there's a smaller region y that touches the boundary of z. Inside y, there's an even smaller region x that doesn't touch the boundary of y. Can x touch the boundary of z?

If y touches the boundary of z, it means there's a point on the boundary of y that also lies on the boundary of z. Given that x doesn't touch the boundary of y, x can't touch the boundary of z at that point. 

But could there be another part of z's boundary that "dips in" and touches x? Actually, that's not consistent with the given constraints. If a part of z's boundary were to dip in so much that it touches x, it would have to pass through y, which would mean y is not a proper part of z (as there would be parts of z inside y).

OK, let me be absolutely certain by articulating the definition of these relations in terms of topological interiors, exteriors, and boundaries.

1. NTPP(x,y): The topological closure of x is contained in the topological interior of y. This implies the boundary of x is disjoint from the boundary of y.
2. TPPi(y,z): TPP(z,y), which means the topological interior of z is not disjoint from the boundary of y, and the interior of z is contained in the interior of y.

Actually, I think I stated that second one incorrectly. Let's go back to the basics. TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b, so a is inside b and touches b's boundary. So, TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a, or in other words, a is a tangential proper part inverse of b. This implies b is inside a and touches a's boundary.

Now, I need to ensure clarity with the constraint TPPi(y,z).

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. That's not consistent with my earlier understanding where y is inside z. Let me break it down again.

TPP(a,b) means a is a proper part of b, and a touches the boundary of b.
TPPi(a,b) = TPP(b,a).

So, TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y, and z touches the boundary of y.

Now, I have:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given this, z and x are both inside y. Z touches y's boundary, while x doesn't.

Now, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z. Since x and z are both inside y, they can have any of the following relationships:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical.

There's no additional constraint that forces one of these to be the only possible relation.

Actually, I think I misunderstood the notation. Let me check the definition of RCC-8 relationships again.

* DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no part in common).
* EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (just touching).
* PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
* TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
* NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
* TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
* NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
* EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

OK, I definitely misunderstood the notation in my previous train of thought. Let me reconfigure.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is inside y and touches y's boundary, and not the other way around.

Now, I have:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given this, z and x are both inside y. Z touches y's boundary, while x doesn't.

Now, I'll determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be completely separate within y. This is possible.
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries without sharing interiors. This is possible.
3. PO(x,z): x and z can overlap without either being contained in the other. This is possible.
4. TPP(x,z): x can be inside z and touch z's boundary. This is possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): z can be inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be inside x without touching x's boundary. This is possible.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z can be the same region. This is possible.

Wait, I think there's a logical contradiction in one of these. If z touches y's boundary, and if z is inside x, then x must also touch y's boundary. But this contradicts our given NTPP(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Similarly, if z and x are the same, and z touches y's boundary, then x must also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm still confused about some of the above relationships. Let me draw out some examples to clarify:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. Just imagine two separate regions inside y, with z touching y's boundary and x not touching y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible. Imagine x and z touching at a point inside y, with z reaching out to touch y's boundary while x remains away from y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Imagine x and z sharing some space inside y, with z also extending to touch y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes. Imagine z inside y and touching y's boundary, and x inside z touching z's boundary but not touching y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, this is possible. Imagine z inside y and touching y's boundary, and x deep inside z, away from both z's and y's boundaries.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If z touches y's boundary and z is inside x, then x must also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But, given that z touches y's boundary, it can't be entirely inside x (which is inside y and not touching y's boundary). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z are the same, and z touches y's boundary, then x must also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Given this clarification, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

On second thought, I'm not 100% sure about TPP(x,z). Let's double-check this by thinking about it step-by-step. 

Suppose TPP(x,z) is true. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. At the same time, we have:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

If x touches z's boundary and z touches y's boundary, is it necessarily true that x touches y's boundary? I don't think so. Imagine a nested structure: y is the outermost, z is inside y, and x is inside z. Z touches y's boundary at a specific point. X touches z's boundary at a different point, not the point where z touches y's boundary. This way, x doesn't touch y's boundary, satisfying NTPP(x,y).

So, TPP(x,z) is also possible.

Hang on. I need to pay attention more closely to the constraints. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

So, x and z are both inside y, with z touching y's boundary and x not touching y's boundary.

No, wait. I'm confusing myself. Let me clearly articulate the definitions again:

* DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
* EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (just touching).
* PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
* TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y, touching y's boundary).
* NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y, not touching y's boundary).
* TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x)).
* NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x)).
* EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Now, with these clear definitions:

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y, not touching y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y) means z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Thus, x and z are both inside y, with z touching y's boundary and x not touching y's boundary.

Given this, let's again check the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. Just imagine two separate regions inside y, with z touching y's boundary and x not touching y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (just touching). This is possible. Imagine x and z touching at a point inside y, with z reaching out to touch y's boundary while x remains away from y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Imagine x and z sharing some space inside y, with z also extending to touch y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z, touching z's boundary). This is possible. Imagine z inside y and touching y's boundary, and x inside z touching z's boundary but not touching y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z, not touching z's boundary). Again, this is possible. Imagine z inside y and touching y's boundary, and x deep inside z, away from both z's and y's boundaries.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x, touching x's boundary). But this contradicts our earlier understanding. If z touches y's boundary and z is inside x, then x must also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x, not touching x's boundary). But this contradicts TPPi(y,z), which says z touches y's boundary. If z is inside x and not touching x's boundary, and x is inside y and not touching y's boundary, then z can't touch y's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z are the same, and z touches y's boundary, then x must also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think that now, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This is my final answer, as I'm now confident in it. 

I do need to make one final check on the TPP(x,z) possibility, since I was unsure earlier. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z, touching z's boundary). We know:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is inside y, not touching y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

If x touches z's boundary (as required by TPP(x,z)), and z touches y's boundary, does that imply x touches y's boundary? Not necessarily. X can touch z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible, and my list of possible RCC-8 relations remains:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

Let me consider the spatial relations carefully:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.

2. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y (since TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y)). This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So we have both x and z inside y, with z touching y's boundary and x not touching y's boundary.

Given these constraints, x and z could have the following possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be completely disconnected within y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries without overlapping.
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap each other.
4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z (inside z and touching z's boundary).
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z (completely inside z without touching z's boundary).

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because:
- If z were inside x or equal to x, then since z touches y's boundary, x would also have to touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y).
