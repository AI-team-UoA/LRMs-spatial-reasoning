PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $\text{NTPP}(x, y)$ and $\text{EQ}(y, z)$.

First, let me break down what the given relations mean:

1. $\text{NTPP}(x, y)$ means that $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $y$. In other words, $x$ is completely contained within $y$ and does not touch $y$'s boundary.

2. $\text{EQ}(y, z)$ means that $y$ and $z$ are spatially equivalent or coincident. They occupy the exact same region of space.

Now, to find the relationship between $x$ and $z$, I need to understand what happens when we combine these relations.

Since $y$ and $z$ are spatially equivalent (i.e., $\text{EQ}(y, z)$), any spatial relationship that $x$ has with $y$ would also hold with $z$. 

Given that $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $y$ (i.e., $\text{NTPP}(x, y)$), and $y$ is spatially equivalent to $z$, it follows that $x$ must also be a non-tangential proper part of $z$.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between $x$ and $z$ is $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$.

To double-check this: 
- $x$ cannot be disconnected from $z$ because it's contained within $y$, which is equivalent to $z$.
- $x$ cannot merely touch $z$ because it's fully contained within $y$ without touching $y$'s boundary.
- $x$ cannot partially overlap $z$ because it's completely contained within $y$.
- $x$ cannot be a tangential proper part of $z$ because it doesn't touch $y$'s boundary, and $y$ is equivalent to $z$.
- $x$ cannot be equivalent to $z$ because it's a proper part of $y$, which is equivalent to $z$.
- $z$ cannot be a proper part of $x$ because $x$ is a proper part of $y$, and $y$ is equivalent to $z$.

So, the only possibility is that $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $z$, or $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$.

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

To determine the relationship between x and z, I need to consider what happens when we combine these relations.

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical in spatial extent, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), and y is identical to z, it follows that x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
