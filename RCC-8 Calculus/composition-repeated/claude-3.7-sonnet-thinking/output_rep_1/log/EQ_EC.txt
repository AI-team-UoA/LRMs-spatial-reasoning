PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this problem step by step.

We're given:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts

We need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial entity. This means that x has exactly the same spatial relationship with z as y does with z.

Given that EC(y,z), and x is coincident with y, then x must also be externally connected to z.

So the relationship between x and z must be:
EC(x,z)

This is the only possibility since x and y are exactly coincident, and y is externally connected to z, then x must also be externally connected to z.

Let's verify:
1. If EQ(x,y), then x and y occupy exactly the same space.
2. If EC(y,z), then y touches z only at their boundaries.
3. Since x occupies exactly the same space as y, x must also touch z only at their boundaries.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure:

- EQ(x,y) means x and y are exactly the same region
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries only
- Since x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), and y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then x must also touch z at its boundary
- Therefore, EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship

Yes, I'm confident that the answer is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given the information:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior points

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical spatial regions, x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z. Because y is externally connected to z, x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
