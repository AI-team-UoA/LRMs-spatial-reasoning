PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step. We know:
1. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.
2. DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, meaning they share no spatial parts.

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), they occupy exactly the same space. Since y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), y shares no spatial parts with z.

Given that x and y occupy exactly the same space (EQ(x,y)), and y shares no spatial parts with z (DC(y,z)), it follows that x must also share no spatial parts with z.

So, the relationship between x and z must be: DC(x,z).

This is the only possible relationship because x and y are exactly the same spatial region (due to EQ(x,y)), so x must have the same relationship with z as y does with z. Since y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), x must also be disconnected from z.

Therefore, the answer is: DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z based on the given information:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same space)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no spatial parts)

Since x and y occupy exactly the same space (they're equivalent), and y is disconnected from z, then x must also be disconnected from z. The spatial relationship properties must be preserved.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
