PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We are asked to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z, where we already know the spatial relationships:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- DC(y,z): This means that y and z are disconnected.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z.

Since TPPi(x,y), we know that y is inside x and touches x's boundary. And since DC(y,z), we know that y and z have no common part.

What could be the relationship between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): If z is completely outside x, then x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): If z touches the boundary of x but doesn't share any interior part, then they are externally connected.
3. PO(x,z): If z partially overlaps with x, they share some parts but neither is contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. This seems contradictory with the fact that y is inside x and y is disconnected from z. If y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y should be inside z or at least overlap with z. So, TPP(x,z) seems unlikely.
5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, this contradicts the fact that y is inside x and y is disconnected from z. So, NTPP(x,z) seems unlikely.
6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This could be consistent with DC(y,z), because y could be in one part of x, and z could be in another part of x, without them overlapping.
7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This could also be consistent with DC(y,z).
8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then how can y, which is part of x, be disconnected from z? This is a contradiction, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me think through each possible relation more systematically.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Consistent? I'm not sure if this is consistent with the information we have. If y is inside x, and y and z are disconnected, can x and z be disconnected? It depends on how much of x is filled by y.

Let's think about this geometrically. Imagine x as a big circle, and y as a smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x. Now, since DC(y,z), z cannot intersect with y. So, z can be completely outside of x (DC(x,z)), or it can touch the boundary of x without intersecting with y (EC(x,z)), or it can overlap with parts of x that don't include y (PO(x,z)), or it can be completely inside x without overlapping with y (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)).

So, the possible relations appear to be: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check DC(x,z) for consistency. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected. Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? Yes, if z is completely outside of x, then x and z would be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is consistent with the given information.

Let me double-check EC(x,z) for consistency. If z touches the boundary of x without intersecting with y, then z and x are externally connected, and z and y would be disconnected. So, EC(x,z) is consistent with the given information.

Let me double-check PO(x,z) for consistency. If z overlaps with x but doesn't intersect with y, then z and x partially overlap, and z and y would be disconnected. So, PO(x,z) is consistent with the given information.

Let me double-check TPPi(x,z) for consistency. If z is a tangential proper part of x and doesn't intersect with y, then z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and is disconnected from y. So, TPPi(x,z) is consistent with the given information.

Let me double-check NTPPi(x,z) for consistency. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x and doesn't intersect with y, then z is inside x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, and is disconnected from y. So, NTPPi(x,z) is consistent with the given information.

Let me double-check TPP(x,z) for inconsistency. If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. But if y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is inside x, and x is inside z, so y should be inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not consistent with the given information.

Let me double-check NTPP(x,z) for inconsistency. If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But if y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is inside x, and x is inside z, so y should be inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not consistent with the given information.

Let me double-check EQ(x,z) for inconsistency. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. But if y is a tangential proper part of x, and x and z are the same, then y is a tangential proper part of z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not consistent with the given information.

Now, let's take a step back and reconsider. We were asked to find the possible relationships between x and z given that TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected.

Let's exhaustively consider all RCC8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   
   Is this possible? Yes, x and z can be completely separate, and y can be a tangential proper part of x, and y and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but share no interior).
   
   Is this possible? Yes, x and z can touch at a boundary, with y as a tangential proper part of x, and y and z can still be disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (share some parts but neither is a part of the other).
   
   Is this possible? Yes, x and z can partially overlap, with y as a tangential proper part of x inside the non-overlapping part of x, and y and z would still be disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).
   
   Is this possible? No, this violates the given conditions. If x is inside z, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is also inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary).
   
   Is this possible? No, this also violates the given conditions for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).
   
   Is this possible? Yes, z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, with y as another tangential proper part of x, and y and z can still be disconnected if they are in different parts of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).
   
   Is this possible? Yes, z can be inside x and not touch x's boundary, with y as a tangential proper part of x, and y and z can still be disconnected if they are in different parts of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   
   Is this possible? No, this violates the given conditions. If x and z are the same, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is also a tangential proper part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

These relations make intuitive sense, given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z). We can't have either x inside z or x equals z, because then y would have some relationship with z that contradicts their being disconnected. But x and z can be separate (DC), touching (EC), partially overlapping (PO), or z can be inside x either touching x's boundary (TPPi) or not (NTPPi).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let me understand what these constraints mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (share no parts)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x and z can be completely separate regions.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y being in the non-overlapping part of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Impossible. If x were inside z, then y (which is inside x) would have to be inside z as well, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible. For the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x in a different area than y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, located in a different part than y.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z were identical, y would have to be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
