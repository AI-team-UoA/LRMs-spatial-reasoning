PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's go through what these relations mean again.
- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

Now, I am given that:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means that NTPP(y,x), which means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): This means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

I'm asked for the possible relationships between x and z.

Let me think about this step by step. 

NTPP(y,x) means that y is a proper part of x. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z. So y is contained inside both x and z. 

From the perspective of x and z, since y is contained within both, we have several possibilities:

1. z could be completely outside of x (DC relationship).
2. z could touch x at the boundary (EC relationship).
3. z could overlap with x but neither is completely contained in the other (PO relationship).
4. z could be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x (TPP relationship).
5. z could be a proper part of x and not touch the boundary of x (NTPP relationship).
6. x could be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z (TPPi or TPP(z,x) relationship).
7. x could be a proper part of z and not touch the boundary of z (NTPPi or NTPP(z,x) relationship).
8. x and z could be coincident (EQ relationship).

Let's check if any of these relationships are impossible given the constraints.

For relationship 1 (DC): If z is completely outside of x, how can y be contained within both x and z? This is not possible.

For relationship 2 (EC): If z and x only touch at the boundary and don't overlap, how can y be contained within both? This is not possible.

For relationship 3 (PO): This is possible. x and z could overlap, and y could be in the region where they overlap.

For relationship 4 (TPP): This is possible. z could be a proper part of x. Since NTPP(y,z), y doesn't touch the boundary of z. And since NTPP(y,x), y also doesn't touch the boundary of x.

For relationship 5 (NTPP): This is similar to relationship 4 and also possible.

For relationship 6 (TPPi or TPP(z,x)): This is possible. x could be a proper part of z. y is a proper part of x and hence also a proper part of z.

For relationship 7 (NTPPi or NTPP(z,x)): This is similar to relationship 6 and also possible.

For relationship 8 (EQ): If x and z are coincident, that means x is z. But in that case, both NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z) are specifying the same relation, which is consistent.

So, the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(z,x): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Wait, I need to be a bit more careful with the reasoning. Let's double-check by thinking about the specific definitions.

NTPP(y,x) means that y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's reconsider the possible relationships:

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap but neither is a part of the other. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, the only way this can work is if y is in the overlapping region. This is possible.

2. TPP(z,x): This means z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. But if z touches the boundary of x, and y is a proper part of z, then depending on the exact position of y within z, y might also touch the boundary of x. But we know from NTPP(y,x) that y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So the question is: can y be a proper part of z, z touch the boundary of x, and y still not touch the boundary of x? Yes, this is possible. So TPP(z,x) is a possible relationship.

3. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a proper part of x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(z,x) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. Given that y is a proper part of x (from NTPP(y,x)), y would also be a proper part of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). The question is whether y touching the boundary of x contradicts NTPP(y,z). No, it doesn't, because y can still be nowhere near the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Hmm, actually, I've made a mistake in my reasoning. Let's be precise:

NTPP(y,x) means that y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Both conditions are about y not touching the boundary of x or z, not about y touching the boundary of any other region. So the previous reasoning is correct.

Let's continue:

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Given that y is a proper part of x (from NTPP(y,x)), y would also be a proper part of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

6. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. Since y is a proper part of x (from NTPP(y,x)), y would also be a proper part of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Relationships 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 seem to be the only possible ones. Let's think if there might be any other constraints or relationships that I've missed.

Actually, let's see if the relationships DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are truly impossible.

For DC(x,z), we have that NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z. If x and z are disconnected, then they have no points in common. But y, being a part of both, should have points in common with both, which contradicts the disconnection. So DC(x,z) is indeed impossible.

For EC(x,z), we have that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Again, y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z, meaning it's within the interior of both. But if x and z don't share interior parts, then y cannot be a part of both. So EC(x,z) is also impossible.

It seems like the possible relationships between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) (or equivalently NTPP(y,x)) and NTPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Wait, let me double check once more. Actually, let's think about this in a different way to ensure I haven't missed anything.

Given NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z), we know that y is in the interior of both x and z. Therefore, x and z must have a non-empty intersection. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Now, given this non-empty intersection, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z overlap but neither is a part of the other.
- TPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

So my conclusion is that the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let's re-examine PO(x,z). Here's my concern: PO means that x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, y is in the overlapping region. But the constraint that neither is part of the other seems tricky. 

Actually, no, this is possible. For instance, imagine x and z as two circles that overlap but neither circle is fully inside the other. In the overlapping region, we place a smaller circle y. Then y is a proper part of both x and z, but neither x nor z is a part of the other.

So I think PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let's take another approach and ask which relation can hold between x and z so that NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(y, z) can both be true.

NTPP(y, x) means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
NTPP(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

- DC(x, z) (disconnected): Impossible, because y would need to be in both x and z, but if x and z are disconnected, there's no shared region.

- EC(x, z) (externally connected): Impossible, because y would need to be in both x and z, but if x and z only touch at their boundaries, there's no shared interior region.

- PO(x, z) (partially overlapping): Possible. x and z share a part, and y could be within this shared region. Since y is a non-tangential part of both x and z, it doesn't touch the boundary of either, which is consistent with PO(x, z).

- TPP(x, z) (tangential proper part): Possible. x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, y is also a proper part of z. Since y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, y doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y, z).

- NTPP(x, z) (non-tangential proper part): Possible. x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, y is also a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y, z).

- TPP(z, x) (tangential proper part inverse): Possible. z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Therefore, y is also a proper part of x. Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and z touches the boundary of x, y doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is consistent with NTPP(y, x).

- NTPP(z, x) (non-tangential proper part inverse): Possible. z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Therefore, y is also a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is consistent with NTPP(y, x).

- EQ(x, z) (equal): Possible. x and z are the same region. y is a proper part of x (equivalent to z) and doesn't touch the boundary, which is consistent with both NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(y, z).

This confirms our earlier result.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, just to make sure, let's check one more. Is TPP(z, x) really consistent with NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(y, z)?

TPP(z, x) means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
NTPP(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
NTPP(y, x) means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Since y is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x, y is also a proper part of x. That checks out.

Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and z is a proper part of x, y doesn't touch the boundary of x. That checks out as well.

So yes, TPP(z, x) is consistent with NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(y, z).

Let's do the same for NTPP(z, x):

NTPP(z, x) means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
NTPP(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
NTPP(y, x) means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Since y is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x, y is also a proper part of x. That checks out.

Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, y also doesn't touch the boundary of x. That checks out as well.

So NTPP(z, x) is consistent with NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(y, z).

Great, our reasoning is sound. So the possible relations are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me rewrite them in alphabetical order for clarity:
- EQ(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)

That's our answer.

Hmm, let me check once more by going through a different reasoning path, just to be sure. 

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z): This means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these, y is in the interior of both x and z. So x and z must have a non-empty intersection.

Let's go through the possible relations:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is ruled out as they need to have a non-empty intersection.

- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means they only share boundary points, not interior points. But since y is in the interior of both, this is ruled out.

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share some parts, but not all. This is consistent with y being in the interior of both.

- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z. This is consistent with y being in the interior of both x and z.

- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means all of x is inside z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with y being in the interior of both x and z.

- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x. This is consistent with y being in the interior of both z and x.

- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is inside x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with y being in the interior of both z and x.

- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. This is obviously consistent with y being in the interior of both.

So, all relations are possible except DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

So the possible relations are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- EQ(x,z)

This matches our previous answer, so I'm confident that it's correct.

Actually, am I really sure that PO is possible? Let me construct an example to double check. 

Imagine a square x, and another square z of the same size, where they are positioned such that they overlap in one corner. In the overlapping region, place a small circle y that doesn't touch the boundaries of either x or z. Then y is a proper part of both x and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of either. Thus, NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(y, z) are satisfied. And x and z are in a PO relationship because they share some parts but not all. So PO is indeed a possible relationship between x and z.

So, our answer is correct: The possible relations between x and z are PO, TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x), and EQ(x,z).

Let's double check PO with a more precise definition. PO means that some parts of x are in z, and some parts of x are not in z, and some parts of z are in x, and some parts of z are not in x. Is this always consistent with NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(y, z)?

NTPP(y, x) means that y is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
NTPP(y, z) means that y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, y is in the interior of both x and z. This means the interiors of x and z have a non-empty intersection. Given this, is it possible for x and z to be in a PO relationship?

Yes, it is. For example, consider two circles that overlap but don't fully contain one another. The overlapping region is in the interior of both circles. Now place a smaller circle y inside this overlapping region such that it doesn't touch the boundary of either of the larger circles. Then y is inside both and doesn't touch the boundary of either. So NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(y, z) are satisfied. And x and z are in a PO relationship because they share parts but neither is fully contained in the other.

I'm now confident that our answer is correct.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these given relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z must have overlapping interiors. This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) as possible relationships.

Let me check each remaining relationship:

1. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap with y in their shared region.

2. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be properly inside z while touching z's boundary, with y inside x.

3. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be properly inside z without touching z's boundary, with y inside x.

4. TPP(z,x): Possible. z can be properly inside x while touching x's boundary, with y inside z.

5. NTPP(z,x): Possible. z can be properly inside x without touching x's boundary, with y inside z.

6. EQ(x,z): Possible. If x and z are the same region, y is properly inside both.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x), EQ(x,z)
