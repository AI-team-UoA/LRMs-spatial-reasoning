PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze the scenario:

1. EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they share the exact same spatial region.
2. PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), x shares the exact same spatial region as y. Given that y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), and x is exactly the same as y, it follows that x must have the same relationship with z as y does with z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

To verify this, let's examine whether any other RCC-8 relation could hold between x and z:

- DC(x,z) would mean x and z are disconnected, but since y and z overlap and x is the same as y, this can't be the case.
- EC(x,z) would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Since y and z share interior parts (as implied by PO(y,z)), and x is the same as y, EC(x,z) can't hold.
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, but since y is not a part of z (as specified by PO(y,z)), and x is the same as y, TPP(x,z) can't hold.
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, but for the same reason as above, this can't be the case.
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, but since z is not a part of y (as specified by PO(y,z)), and x is the same as y, TPPi(x,z) can't hold.
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, but for the same reason as above, this can't be the case.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident, but since y and z are not coincident (as specified by PO(y,z)), and x is the same as y, EQ(x,z) can't hold.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, I want to carefully check another possibility. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident. PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

If x and y are coincident, then they occupy the exact same spatial region. And if y partially overlaps with z, then x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way. There's no other possibility given the constraints.

So, the final answer is PO(x,z).

Actually, i think I'm rushing too quickly to a conclusion. Let's double-check my reasoning by rigorously applying the definitions of the RCC-8 relations.

Let's denote by I(x) the interior of x, and by B(x) the boundary of x. The RCC-8 relations can be defined in terms of intersections of interiors and boundaries as follows:

- DC(x,y): I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅ and B(x) ∩ B(y) = ∅ (no common points)
- EC(x,y): I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅ and B(x) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅ (only boundaries touch)
- PO(x,y): I(x) ∩ I(y) ≠ ∅ and x ⊈ y and y ⊈ x (they overlap but neither is a part of the other)
- TPP(x,y): x ⊂ y and B(x) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅ (x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPP(x,y): x ⊂ y and B(x) ∩ B(y) = ∅ (x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
- TPPi(x,y): y ⊂ x and B(x) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅ (y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPPi(x,y): y ⊂ x and B(x) ∩ B(y) = ∅ (y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary)
- EQ(x,y): x = y (x and y are the same region)

Given:
- EQ(x,y): This means x = y.
- PO(y,z): This means I(y) ∩ I(z) ≠ ∅, y ⊈ z, and z ⊈ y.

Since x = y (from EQ(x,y)), we can substitute x for y in the PO(y,z) relation:
PO(x,z): I(x) ∩ I(z) ≠ ∅, x ⊈ z, and z ⊈ x.

So, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

Let me do a sanity check again:

1. x and y are the same region.
2. y partially overlaps with z, meaning they share some interior parts but neither is contained within the other.
3. Since x is the same as y, x must also partially overlap with z in the same way that y does.

So, the relation between x and z is indeed PO(x,z).

Actually, I just realized I might not have considered all the nuances of the RCC-8 calculus. Let me try a slightly different approach to ensure I haven't missed any possible situations.

Given the transitivity table for RCC-8 (which I don't have to hand, so I'll reason it out), we're trying to find the possible relations R such that EQ(x,y) ∧ PO(y,z) → R(x,z).

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical in terms of spatial regions, any relation that y has with another object z, x will have the exact same relation with z. 

So, if PO(y,z), then PO(x,z) must also hold.

To double-check this:

- If x and y are the same region, and y shares some interior parts with z but neither is part of the other, then x (being the same as y) must also share some interior parts with z but neither is part of the other.

I'm confident that the relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, I'm still not using the right approach. Let's use the transitivity table for RCC-8. Since we have EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), we want to find all possible relations R such that EQ ∘ PO = R.

I know that in the RCC-8 transitivity table, EQ(x,y) ∘ R(y,z) = R(x,z) for any relation R. This means that if the relation between y and z is R, then the relation between x and z is also R.

So, if PO(y,z), then PO(x,z) must hold.

But let's verify with the formal definition of the RCC-8 relations once more:

- EQ(x,y): x = y.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other.

Given these, and the fact that x = y, it's clear that x and z will share the same interior parts that y and z share, and neither x is part of z nor z is part of x. This is the definition of PO(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

Wait, I've been neglecting to consider possible ambiguities or multiple possibilities. Let me reconsider.

Actually, I've been correct: if EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the only possible relation between x and z is PO(x,z). This is because:

1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same spatial region.
2. If y and z have a certain relation, then x and z must have the same relation, since x and y are the same region.
3. The given relation between y and z is PO(y,z).
4. Therefore, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

The fact that EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same spatial region is crucial here. This means that any relation y has with another object, x will have the same relation.

Given the clear definitions and the fact that EQ(x,y) implies x and y are the same, I'm confident that the relation between x and z is PO(x,z), and there are no other possibilities.

Actually, we can use the composition rule for RCC-8. Let's denote by R1 ∘ R2 the composition of relations R1 and R2. This gives all possible relations that can hold between two objects when there's an intermediate object related to the first by R1 and to the second by R2.

For RCC-8, we know that EQ ∘ R = R for any relation R. This means that if the relation between x and y is EQ, and the relation between y and z is R, then the relation between x and z is also R.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): The relation between x and y is EQ.
- PO(y,z): The relation between y and z is PO.

Using the composition rule: EQ ∘ PO = PO.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

OK, I'm confident that the answer is:

PO(x,z)

Just to be triple sure:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): This means x and y are coincident, i.e., they share the exact same spatial region.
- PO(y,z): This means y and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other.

Since x and y are the same region, and y partially overlaps with z, it follows that x must also partially overlap with z in the exact same way. Therefore, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

So, the final answer is PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relation holds between x and z given the constraints EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze this step by step:

1) EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

2) PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap - they share some interior parts, but neither is contained within the other.

Since x and y are exactly the same region (from EQ(x,y)), any spatial relation that y has with another region z must be identical to the relation that x has with z.

Therefore, if PO(y,z) holds, and x is identical to y, then x must have the exact same partial overlap relationship with z.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
