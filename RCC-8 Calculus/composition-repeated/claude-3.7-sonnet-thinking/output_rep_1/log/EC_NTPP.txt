PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We're told that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's consider what these given relations mean spatially:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

Since y is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), and x touches y at the boundary, x must reach into z to touch y. However, there are a few possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is impossible because if x and y touch, and y is completely inside z, then x must have some contact with z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches z at the boundary and also reaches inside to touch y.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x partially overlaps with z. x could have a part inside z (where it touches y) and a part outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is a tangential proper part of z. In this scenario, x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is impossible because if x is completely inside z (away from the boundary) and y is also completely inside z, there's no way x and y can touch at their boundaries as required by EC(x,y).

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If y is completely inside z, and z is inside x touching x's boundary, then y would be inside x (not touching x's boundary). This contradicts EC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If y is completely inside z, and z is completely inside x, then y would be completely inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. If y is completely inside z and x and z are the same, then y would be completely inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

I think the possible relations are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(x,z).

But let me double-check by considering the spatial scenarios more carefully:

- EC(x,z): x touches z's boundary. Given that y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, it seems like x must reach inside z. But this contradicts the definition of EC, where two regions only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior parts. So, EC(x,z) is actually impossible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me re-evaluate.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

For EC(x,z) to be possible, x would need to touch z's boundary but not share any interior parts with z. However, since y is completely inside z and x touches y, x must have some part inside z. This contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

For PO(x,z) to be possible, x would have a part inside z (where it touches y) and a part outside z. This doesn't contradict any of the given constraints, so PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z) to be possible, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y, which is completely inside z and not touching z's boundary, it seems like x would extend from y to the boundary of z. This doesn't contradict any of the given constraints, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

For DC(x,z) to be possible, x and z would be disconnected. Since y is inside z and x touches y, x would have to be inside z to some extent, which contradicts the definition of DC. So, DC(x,z) is impossible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be possible, x would need to be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. However, if x and y touch at their boundaries, and y is completely inside z and not touching z's boundary, for x to touch y's boundary, x might touch z's boundary (which would make it TPP) or it might not (which would make it NTPP). So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Based on this re-evaluation, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, I don't think I'm correct about the NTPP(x,z) case. Let me think more carefully.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), and y is completely inside z and not touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), then x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me reconsider all possibilities.

1. DC(x,z): This is impossible because if x and y touch, and y is completely inside z, then x must have some contact with z (either overlapping or touching).

2. EC(x,z): For this to be true, x would touch z's boundary but not share any interior with z. If y is inside z and x touches y, then x must share some interior with z, which contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x partially overlaps with z. x could have a part inside z (where it touches y) and a part outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is a tangential proper part of z. x would be inside z, touch z's boundary, and also touch y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. x can still touch y, which is also inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If y is inside z, and z is inside x, then y is inside x. Since x and y touch at their boundaries (EC(x,y)), and y is inside x, this contradicts EC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar reasoning as for TPPi(x,z), this is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. If y is inside z, then y is inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, wait. I need to think about the case of NTPP(x,z) more. If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary. And if EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries. Given that NTPP(y,z), y is also completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

If both x and y are completely inside z and away from z's boundary, and they touch at their boundaries, this doesn't lead to any contradiction. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Just to be sure, let's think once more, especially about the possibility of EC(x,z):

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would touch at their boundaries but not overlap in their interiors. But given that y is completely inside z, and x touches y, x must have a part inside z. This contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

Alright, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, I think I need to reconsider the case of NTPP(x,z). If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is also completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and if x and y must touch at their boundaries, there's a spatial arrangement that works.

For instance, consider two concentric circles inside a larger circle. The inner two circles can touch each other, with both being inside the larger circle and away from its boundary. So, the NTPP(x,z) case is possible.

Let's double check the other possibilities again:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible, as I've already established.
2. EC(x,z): Impossible, as I've already established.
3. PO(x,z): Possible, as I've already established.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible, as I've already established.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible, as I've just reconsidered.
6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible, as I've already established.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible, as I've already established.
8. EQ(x,z): Impossible, as I've already established.

Based on this final analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think about the case PO(x,z) again as well. If PO(x,z), x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at their boundaries. And if NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

If y is completely inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then at least a part of x must be inside z (to touch y). But x can also have a part outside z, which would make it PO(x,z).

For example, consider a small circle (y) inside a larger circle (z), and a third circle (x) that partly overlaps with z, with the overlapping portion touching y. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

This confirms my final analysis:
The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I want to double check the case of NTPP(x,z) more carefully.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would be completely inside z, away from z's boundary. If y is also completely inside z, away from z's boundary, and x and y touch at their boundaries, I think this can be spatially arranged.

For instance, consider two circles (x and y) that touch at their circumferences, both inside a larger circle (z), without touching the larger circle's circumference. This would correspond to EC(x,y) and NTPP(x,z) and NTPP(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

After careful analysis, my final answer is:
The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's do a final check. We have:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

We want to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- DC(x,z): Impossible because if x touches y, and y is inside z, then x has some contact with z.
- EC(x,z): Impossible because if x and y touch at their boundaries, and y is inside z, then x must have a part inside z, which contradicts the definition of EC.
- PO(x,z): Possible. x can have a part inside z (where it touches y) and a part outside z.
- TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z, touch z's boundary, and also touch y.
- NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z, away from z's boundary, and still touch y.
- TPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y).
- NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z is inside x, away from x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y is inside x, away from x's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z are the same, and y is inside z, then y is inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let's see if NTPP(x,z) is really possible. If NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries. And since NTPP(y,z), y is also a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Consider a scenario where both x and y are inside z, away from z's boundary, and they touch at their boundaries. This doesn't contradict any of the given constraints. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

My final answer remains:
The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me sketch out a few examples to make sure I've got these correct.

Let's denote regions as rough ovals, and indicate their boundaries.

NTPP(x,z) and EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):
```
    z
  /     \
 |        |
 |   x    |
 |  /  \  |
 | |    | |
 | |    | |
 |  \  /  |
 |   y    |
 |        |
  \     /
```

Here, x and y both are inside z (away from z's boundary), and they touch at their boundaries.

TPP(x,z) and EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):

```
    z
  /     \
 |        |
 |   x    |
 |  /  \  |
 | |    | |
 | |    | |
 |  \  /  |
 |   y    |
 |        |
  \     /
```

This is similar to the previous case, but now x touches z's boundary. However, y remains inside z, away from z's boundary, and x and y still touch at their boundaries.

PO(x,z) and EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):

```
     x
   /   \
  |     \
  |      \    z
  |       \ /   \
  |        |     |
  |        |     |
   \       |     |
    \      |     |
     \     |     |
      \    |     |
       \   |     |
        \  |     |
         \ |     |
          \|     |
           y     |
           |     |
            \   /
```

Here, y is inside z (away from z's boundary), x and y touch at their boundaries, and x has a part outside z.

All three cases seem spatially plausible. This further confirms my answer:
The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's more carefully check the PO(x,z) case. PO(x,z) means that x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Given that EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), it means y is entirely inside z away from its boundary, and x and y touch at their boundaries. Since y is inside z, and x touches y, part of x must be inside z. But for PO(x,z) to hold, x must also have a part outside z.

This seems spatially plausible: x can have a part inside z (touching y's boundary) and a part outside z.

So, PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

I think my final answer is correct: The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, my diagram for TPP(x,z) wasn't clear enough. Let me redraw

TPP(x,z) and EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):

```
         z
      /     \
     |        |
     |        |
     |        |
     |  x     |
     | /   \  |
     ||     | |
     ||     | |
     | \   /  |
     |  y     |
     |        |
     |        |
      \      /
```

In this case, x is inside z, touches z's boundary at the top, and also touches y inside. Y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

I think this clarifies the TPP(x,z) case.

My final answer remains: The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. I had a slightly different mental model, so my diagrams might not be the clearest. Let me reason more precisely.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:

1. **PO(x,z)**: This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since y is completely inside z, and x touches y at the boundary, at least a part of x must be inside z. But for PO(x,z) to hold, x must also have a part outside z. This is spatially plausible.

2. **TPP(x,z)**: This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside z and x touches y, it's spatially plausible for x to be inside z and touch z's boundary.

3. **NTPP(x,z)**: This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, since y is inside z and x touches y, it's spatially plausible for x to be inside z and not touch z's boundary.

4. **DC(x,z)**, **EC(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**, and **EQ(x,z)** are all impossible due to the constraints given by EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) tell us about the spatial arrangement:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Let me consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible. Since x touches y (EC(x,y)) and y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), x must have some contact with z.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible. If x only touched z's boundary, it couldn't also touch y which is strictly inside z away from z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can have a part inside z (where it touches y) and a part outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary while also touching y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z away from z's boundary and still touch y at its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z is inside x touching x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y would be inside x not touching x's boundary, contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z is properly inside x, and y is inside z, then y would be properly inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x equals z, and y is properly inside z, then y would be properly inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).
