PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step about what these relations mean.

We are given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y at some point.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is entirely contained within y, and z does not touch the boundary of y at any point.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's visualize this:
- y contains both x and z
- x touches y's boundary
- z does not touch y's boundary (z is fully interior to y)

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? Yes, x could be at one end of y touching y's boundary, while z could be a separate region completely contained within y, not touching x.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Is this possible? Yes, x could touch z at their boundaries while both are contained within y, with x also touching y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. Is this possible? Yes, x and z could partially overlap while both are contained within y, with x also touching y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this possible? Yes, z could contain x, and since x touches y's boundary, x would also touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Is this possible? No, this is not possible. If x touches y's boundary, and x is completely inside z, then z would also have to touch y's boundary. But we know from NTPPi(y,z) that z does not touch y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? Yes, x could contain z and touch z's boundary, while x also touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? Yes, x could completely contain z without z touching x's boundary, while x touches y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. Is this possible? No, this is not possible. If x equals z, then since x touches y's boundary, z would also touch y's boundary. But we know from NTPPi(y,z) that z does not touch y's boundary.

Actually, let me revisit some of these conclusions. I need to be more careful about the constraints.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

Let me check again:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? Yes, they could be separate regions within y, not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z externally connect? Yes, they could touch at their boundaries while both being contained within y.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap? Yes, part of x could overlap with part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z? 
   If x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary, would this be consistent with our given relations?
   If x is inside z, and z is inside y, then x is also inside y.
   x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)).
   For x to be a TPP of z, x needs to touch z's boundary.
   But if x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then z would also have to touch y's boundary.
   This contradicts NTPPi(y,z), which says z does not touch y's boundary.
   So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   If x is completely contained in z and does not touch z's boundary, would this be consistent?
   If x is inside z, and z is inside y, then x is also inside y.
   But TPP(x,y) says x touches y's boundary.
   If x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then z would also have to touch y's boundary.
   This contradicts NTPPi(y,z).
   So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   If z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary, would this be consistent?
   We know z is completely contained in y (from NTPPi(y,z)).
   We know x is completely contained in y (from TPP(x,y)).
   So if z is inside x, it's also inside y, which is consistent.
   Z does not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)).
   For z to be a TPP of x, z needs to touch x's boundary.
   Is it possible for z to touch x's boundary but not y's boundary? Yes, if x's boundary is not entirely along y's boundary.
   So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   If z is completely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary, would this be consistent?
   We know z is completely contained in y (from NTPPi(y,z)).
   We know x is completely contained in y (from TPP(x,y)).
   So if z is inside x, it's also inside y, which is consistent.
   Z does not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)).
   For z to be an NTPP of x, z would not touch x's boundary.
   This is consistent with z not touching y's boundary.
   So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   If x equals z, then the relation between x and y would be the same as the relation between z and y.
   We know TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is NTPP(z,y).
   TPP and NTPP are different relations, so x cannot equal z.
   So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I made an error in my reasoning about TPP(x,z). Let me reconsider this case more carefully.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   If x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary, would this be consistent with our given relations?
   We know x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)).
   We know z does not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)).
   If x touches y's boundary and is contained in z, then some part of z must also touch y's boundary.
   This contradicts NTPPi(y,z).
   So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similar reasoning applies to NTPP(x,z).

Let me summarize the possible relations between x and z:
1. DC(x,z): Possible
2. EC(x,z): Possible
3. PO(x,z): Possible
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

But wait, let me double check again with a different approach.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

Let's use a different approach. Instead of checking each relation, let's reason about what we know:

1. x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
2. z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, what does this tell us about the possible relationships between x and z?

First, we know that both x and z are contained within y, so they are either disconnected, they externally connect, they partially overlap, or one is contained in the other (or they are equal, but we've already ruled that out).

Let's consider the case where z is contained in x. Since z does not touch y's boundary, and x does touch y's boundary, z must not fill x completely. So z can be either a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x.

Now let's consider the case where x is contained in z. If x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary. But this contradicts NTPPi(y,z), which states that z does not touch y's boundary. So x cannot be contained in z.

Now let's consider the remaining cases. Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, x could be near y's boundary while z is somewhere else inside y. Can x and z externally connect? Yes, they could touch at their boundaries. Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they could share some interior points.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me do one final check using visual reasoning. Let's try to draw a spatial arrangement for each possible relation and see if it's consistent with the given constraints.

For DC(x,z):
- Draw y as a big circle.
- Draw x as a small circle inside y, touching y's boundary.
- Draw z as another small circle inside y, not touching x or y's boundary.
This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

For EC(x,z):
- Draw y as a big circle.
- Draw x as a small circle inside y, touching y's boundary.
- Draw z as another small circle inside y, touching x's boundary but not y's boundary.
This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

For PO(x,z):
- Draw y as a big circle.
- Draw x as a small circle inside y, touching y's boundary.
- Draw z as another small circle inside y, overlapping with x but not extending to y's boundary.
This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

For TPP(x,z):
- Draw y as a big circle.
- Draw z as a slightly smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- Draw x as an even smaller circle inside z, touching both z's boundary and y's boundary.
Wait, this isn't possible. If x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then z would also have to touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z):
- Draw y as a big circle.
- Draw z as a slightly smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- Draw x as an even smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary but touching y's boundary.
Again, this isn't possible for the same reason.

For TPPi(x,z):
- Draw y as a big circle.
- Draw x as a slightly smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.
- Draw z as an even smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary but not touching y's boundary.
This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
- Draw y as a big circle.
- Draw x as a slightly smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.
- Draw z as an even smaller circle inside x, not touching either x's boundary or y's boundary.
This is consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

For EQ(x,z):
- If x equals z, then the relation between x and y would be the same as the relation between z and y.
- But TPP(x,y) means x touches y's boundary, while NTPPi(y,z) means z does not touch y's boundary.
- These are contradictory, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So I confirm my previous conclusion. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Wait, let me think a bit more about the case TPP(x,z) to be absolutely sure.

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. x is a proper part of z (x is completely contained in z)
2. x touches the boundary of z (i.e., there's a point on the boundary of x that is also on the boundary of z)

We also have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

If x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of y, then x is also a proper part of y. So far, this is consistent.

x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)), and x touches the boundary of z (from TPP(x,z)).

z does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z)).

If x touches both the boundary of y and the boundary of z, and x is contained within z, then where x touches y's boundary, z must also touch y's boundary.

This contradicts NTPPi(y,z), which says z does not touch y's boundary.

Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similar reasoning applies to NTPP(x,z). If x is completely contained within z and touches y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary. But this contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

Let me also double-check the TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) cases once more.

For TPPi(x,z):
This means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with the fact that z is completely contained in y (from NTPPi(y,z)) and x is completely contained in y (from TPP(x,y)).

z does not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), which means where z touches x's boundary, x's boundary is not also y's boundary. This is possible because x touches y's boundary, but not all of x's boundary needs to be along y's boundary.

So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is completely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary. This is consistent with the fact that z is completely contained in y (from NTPPi(y,z)) and x is completely contained in y (from TPP(x,y)).

z does not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), which is consistent with z not touching x's boundary.

So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Alright, I've carefully checked each possible relation, and my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, wait. Let me consider one more case: EQ(x,z). If x and z are equal, then x does not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)). But TPP(x,y) means x does touch y's boundary. These are contradictory, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me check the reasoning one more time, carefully. Let me consider this in terms of constraints on regions.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
  - x is a proper part of y (all points in x are also in y, but not vice versa)
  - x touches the boundary of y (there's at least one point on the boundary of x that's also on the boundary of y)

- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
  - z is a proper part of y (all points in z are also in y, but not vice versa)
  - z does not touch the boundary of y (all points in z, including its boundary, are in the interior of y)

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - This is possible if x and z do not share any points, but both are contained within y.
   - For example, if y is a large circle, x can be a small circle touching the boundary of y at one point, and z can be another small circle entirely within the interior of y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect.
   - This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap, while both are contained within y.
   - For example, if y is a large circle, x can be a small circle touching the boundary of y at one point, and z can be another small circle touching the boundary of x but not the boundary of y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained within the other, while both are contained within y.
   - For example, if y is a large circle, x can be a small circle touching the boundary of y at one point, and z can be another small circle that partially overlaps with x but doesn't touch the boundary of y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - For this to be true, x would need to be completely contained within z and touch the boundary of z.
   - We know x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)).
   - If x is contained in z and touches the boundary of y, then z would also have to touch the boundary of y at that same point.
   - But this contradicts NTPPi(y,z), which states that z does not touch the boundary of y.
   - Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - For this to be true, x would need to be completely contained within the interior of z.
   - We know x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)).
   - If x is contained in the interior of z and touches the boundary of y, then z would also have to touch the boundary of y.
   - But this contradicts NTPPi(y,z), which states that z does not touch the boundary of y.
   - Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - For this to be true, z would need to be completely contained within x and touch the boundary of x.
   - We know z is completely contained within y and does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z)).
   - We know x is completely contained within y and touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)).
   - For z to be contained in x and touch the boundary of x, z needs to touch a part of x's boundary that's not also on y's boundary.
   - This is possible, for example, if y is a large circle, x is a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and z is an even smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary at a point that's not on y's boundary.
   - Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - For this to be true, z would need to be completely contained within the interior of x.
   - We know z is completely contained within y and does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z)).
   - We know x is completely contained within y and touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)).
   - For z to be contained in the interior of x, z needs to be surrounded by x and not touch the boundary of x.
   - This is possible, for example, if y is a large circle, x is a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at one point, and z is an even smaller circle entirely within the interior of x.
   - Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   - For this to be true, x and z would need to be exactly the same region.
   - We know x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)).
   - We know z does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z)).
   - These are contradictory, so x and z cannot be equal.
   - Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

That's my final answer.

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what we know:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y) - z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is fully inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Let me check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z can be disconnected regions within y
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z can touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible - if x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then z would also have to touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(y,z)
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - for the same reason as TPP(x,z)

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be inside x and touch x's boundary
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be fully inside x without touching x's boundary

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x=z, then x can't both touch and not touch y's boundary
