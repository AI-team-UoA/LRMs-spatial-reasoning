PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step-by-step.

We're given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,z) - x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident.

Let's analyze which of these relationships are possible given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Given that PO(x,y), x partially overlaps with y. And given PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z. 

Let's consider different scenarios:

Scenario 1: The part of y that overlaps with x is different from the part of y that overlaps with z. In this case, x and z might not overlap at all, so DC(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 2: The part of y that overlaps with x is different from the part of y that overlaps with z, but x and z might touch at a boundary. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 3: The parts of y that overlap with x and z have some common portion. In this case, x and z would share some spatial part, so PO(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 4: Can x be part of z (TPP or NTPP)? It's possible if the overlap between x and y is entirely within the overlap between y and z, and additionally, the entirety of x is within z. So, TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are both possible.

Scenario 5: Similarly, z can be part of x (TPPi or NTPPi) if the overlap between y and z is entirely within the overlap between x and y, and the entirety of z is within x. So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are both possible.

Scenario 6: Can x and z be coincident (EQ)? This would mean that both x and z exactly overlap with the same part of y, and they don't extend beyond y. Since PO implies that neither region is part of the other, and both x and y extend into areas where the other isn't, EQ(x,z) is not possible if x and z exactly coincide with the overlap of y. However, if x and z extend in the exact same way beyond y, then EQ(x,z) could be possible. But this seems like a specific case, and I'm not sure if it's generally possible given just the information PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let's think more about whether EQ(x,z) is possible. If x and z are exactly the same, then their relationships with y should also be the same. Since PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), and if x and z are the same, then their overlaps with y should be the same. This is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

But wait, let me try to draw out a concrete example to test this.
Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y have a partial overlap. Neither is a subset of the other.
- PO(y,z): y and z have a partial overlap. Neither is a subset of the other.

If we assume EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. 
x's overlap with y = z's overlap with y. 
But that doesn't contradict PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

I guess EQ(x,z) is possible then.

Let's double-check all the relations:

DC(x,z) - possible
EC(x,z) - possible
PO(x,z) - possible
TPP(x,z) - possible
NTPP(x,z) - possible
TPPi(x,z) - possible
NTPPi(x,z) - possible
EQ(x,z) - possible (upon reflection)

Actually, I'm starting to think that all relations are possible. Let me verify with concrete examples:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Imagine y as a region that touches both x and z, but x and z are on opposite sides of y.
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: If y overlaps with both x and z, and x and z touch each other at the boundary.
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: If the three regions all share a common space, but none is entirely contained in another.
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: If x is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary, and y overlaps with both.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: If x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and y overlaps with both.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse of TPP: If z is completely contained in x but touches x's boundary, and y overlaps with both.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse of NTPP: If z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, and y overlaps with both.
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: If x and z are the same region, and y overlaps with this region.

Yes, it seems like all 8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me double-check with a slightly different approach. Let's label by A the parts where only x is present, B the parts shared by x and y, C the parts where only y is present, D the parts shared by y and z, and E the parts where only z is present. Note B and D might overlap, and we can call their intersection F (so F is the parts common to all of x, y, and z).

PO(x,y) implies A and C are non-empty. PO(y,z) implies C and E are non-empty. 

What are the possible configurations of B and D? They could be disjoint, implying B ∩ D = ∅, or they could have some overlap, implying F = B ∩ D ≠ ∅.

Let's sort through the 8 relations again:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This would require that x and z have no common parts. If B and D are disjoint (F is empty), and x and z don't touch, then DC(x,z).
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: If B and D are disjoint (F is empty), and x and z touch at their boundaries, then EC(x,z).
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: If F is non-empty (i.e., B and D overlap), and both A and E are non-empty, then PO(x,z).
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This would require that x is completely within z and touches z's boundary. But if A is non-empty (from PO(x,y)), then x can't be completely within z. Hmm...

Maybe there's a mistake in my diagram or thinking. Let me re-approach.

Regions:
- x consists of parts A and B.
- y consists of parts B and C.
- z consists of parts C and D.

From PO(x,y), we know that A and C are non-empty. From PO(y,z), we know that B and D are non-empty.

Now, for the various relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: x and z have no common parts and don't touch. If x is A and B, and z is C and D, then they could be DC if A and D don't touch.
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: x and z touch at their boundaries. If A and D touch (but don't overlap), then EC(x,z).
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: x and z share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This could happen if B and C share a part (let's call it E). Then, x consists of A + B, z consists of C + D, and they share E.

Hmm, this doesn't align with my previous reasoning, which suggests I'm making an error somewhere.

Let me try once more with a clear definition of the regions:
- A: Only x (neither y nor z)
- B: x and y (not z)
- C: Only y (neither x nor z)
- D: y and z (not x)
- E: Only z (neither x nor y)
- F: x, y, and z

Now, with these regions, we have:
- x consists of A, B, and F.
- y consists of B, C, D, and F.
- z consists of D, E, and F.

From PO(x,y), we know that regions A and C+D are non-empty. From PO(y,z), we know that regions C+B and E are non-empty.

Now, for the various relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: x and z have no common parts and don't touch. This would be the case if F is empty and regions A+B and D+E don't touch. This seems possible.
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: x and z touch at their boundaries. This would be the case if F is empty and regions A+B and D+E touch. This seems possible.
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: x and z share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This would be the case if F is non-empty, and both A+B and D+E are non-empty. Since we haven't determined the non-emptiness of F, I believe PO(x,z) is possible.
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This would be the case if A is empty, B is non-empty, F is non-empty, and region B touches the boundary of regions D+E. Since A can be empty (from the conditions of PO, we only know that A+F is non-empty), TPP(x,z) seems possible.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this would be the case if A is empty, B is non-empty, F is non-empty, and region B doesn't touch the boundary of regions D+E. NTPP(x,z) seems possible.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse of TPP: z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. This would be the case if E is empty, D is non-empty, F is non-empty, and region D touches the boundary of regions A+B. Since E can be empty (from the conditions of PO, we only know that E+F is non-empty), TPPi(x,z) seems possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse of NTPP: z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, this would be the case if E is empty, D is non-empty, F is non-empty, and region D doesn't touch the boundary of regions A+B. NTPPi(x,z) seems possible.
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: x and z are the same region. This would be the case if A, D, and E are all empty, and B and F are non-empty. But if A is empty, then PO(x,y) requires that region C+D is non-empty. If D is also empty, then C must be non-empty. Similarly, if E is empty, then PO(y,z) requires that region C+B is non-empty. If B is non-empty, this is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) seems possible if A, D, and E are all empty, B and C are non-empty, and C doesn't overlap with F.

However, I'm confused by my own analysis, so let me be cautious.

Actually, let me draw out a more simple diagram: 
1. x is a circle on the left.
2. y is a circle in the middle, overlapping somewhat with both x and z.
3. z is a circle on the right.

In such a configuration, x and z would be disconnected (DC) if the overlap of y with x and the overlap of y with z are separate, and if x and z don't touch. This seems entirely reasonable, so DC(x,z) is possible.

Now, adjust the circles so that x and z are "expanded" to the point where they touch each other's boundary (perhaps the overlaps with y are too, but they don't have to be). Then, we'd have EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is possible.

Next, adjust the circles, so x and z have a small overlap. This would lead to PO(x,z). If the overlap of x and y, and the overlap of y and z, both lie within this overlapping region of x and z, then both PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) remain satisfied. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z), we'd need x to be entirely within z and touching its boundary. Let me try to visualize:
1. x is a circle on the left.
2. z is a larger circle that entirely contains x, with x touching z's boundary.
3. y is a circle that overlaps with part of x and extends outside of z.

In such a scenario, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), and both x and z partially overlap with y, which means PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are satisfied. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), imagine:
1. x is a circle in the center of z.
2. z is a larger circle that entirely contains x, with x not touching z's boundary.
3. y is a circle that overlaps with part of x and extends outside of z.

Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)), and both x and z partially overlap with y, satisfying PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z), we'd have:
1. z is a circle on the left.
2. x is a larger circle that entirely contains z, with z touching x's boundary.
3. y is a circle that overlaps with part of z and extends outside of x.

In this configuration, z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)), and both x and z partially overlap with y, ensuring PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), imagine:
1. z is a circle in the center of x.
2. x is a larger circle that entirely contains z, with z not touching x's boundary.
3. y is a circle that overlaps with part of z and extends outside of x.

In this scenario, z is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)), and both x and z partially overlap with y, meeting the conditions of PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Lastly, for EQ(x,z):
1. x and z are two identical circles.
2. y is a circle that overlaps with a portion of both x and z (which are the same).

Since x and z are the same, by definition, they have the same relationship with y. If PO(x,y), then PO(z,y). So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Based on my analysis, all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, one more check: can x and z be equal (EQ) while both partially overlap with y? Let's think:

If x = z (EQ(x,z)), then any relation of x to y would be the same as z to y. So if PO(x,y), then also PO(z,y). This is consistent with our given conditions. So EQ(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

So my answer is the set of all the 8 possible relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Wait, I think I need to be more careful. Let's reconsider the constraints.

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y share a spatial part.
- Neither x nor y is a part of the other.

Similarly, PO(y,z) means:
- y and z share a spatial part.
- Neither y nor z is a part of the other.

Let's just focus on the objects x, y, and z for clarity. And let's use variables for parts:
- X is the set of points in region x.
- Y is the set of points in region y.
- Z is the set of points in region z.
- X∩Y is the set of points in both regions x and y.
- Y∩Z is the set of points in both regions y and z.
- X∩Z is the set of points in both regions x and z.
- X∩Y∩Z is the set of points in all three regions.

From PO(x,y), we know that X∩Y is not empty, and neither X nor Y is a subset of the other. This means there are points in X that are not in Y, and points in Y that are not in X.

Similarly, from PO(y,z), we know that Y∩Z is not empty, and neither Y nor Z is a subset of the other. This means there are points in Y that are not in Z, and points in Z that are not in Y.

Now, let's revisit the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: X and Z have no common points. Given the conditions, it's possible that X∩Y and Y∩Z are disjoint, meaning X∩Z is empty. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: X and Z have no interior points in common, but they touch at their boundaries. Similar to the above, it's possible that X∩Y and Y∩Z are disjoint, and X and Z touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: X and Z have some points in common, but neither is a subset of the other. It's possible for X∩Z to be non-empty while both X and Z have points that are not in the intersection. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: X is a proper subset of Z, and X touches the boundary of Z. Is this consistent with our constraints? It would mean:
   - X ⊂ Z
   - X and Z's boundary share at least one point.
   - X∩Y is non-empty (from PO(x,y)).
   - Y is not a subset of X and X is not a subset of Y (from PO(x,y)).
   - Y∩Z is non-empty (from PO(y,z)).
   - Y is not a subset of Z and Z is not a subset of Y (from PO(y,z)).

   I believe these conditions can all be met. For instance, if X is a small region at the edge of Z, and Y overlaps with a part of X and extends beyond Z, then TPP(x,z) holds while PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are also satisfied. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: X is a proper subset of Z, and X doesn't touch the boundary of Z. Similar to TPP, this is possible if X is a small region completely inside Z (not touching its boundary), and Y overlaps with a part of X and extends beyond Z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse of TPP: Z is a proper subset of X, and Z touches the boundary of X. This is possible if Z is a small region at the edge of X, and Y overlaps with a part of Z and extends beyond X.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse of NTPP: Z is a proper subset of X, and Z doesn't touch the boundary of X. This is possible if Z is a small region completely inside X (not touching its boundary), and Y overlaps with a part of Z and extends beyond X.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: X and Z are the same set of points. Given our constraints, if X = Z, then PO(x,y) is the same as PO(z,y). Since we're told that both PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and if x = z, then these are the same condition, which is satisfied. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, I believe that all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, I've been overthinking this. Let's use simple examples.

Imagine a Venn diagram with three circles: x, y, and z. We're told that x and y have a partial overlap, and y and z have a partial overlap.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: It's possible that the overlap of x with y is on the left side of y, and the overlap of z with y is on the right side of y, with no common point between x and z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: It's possible that the overlap of x with y extends to touch the overlap of z with y, but without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: It's possible that x and z have some common area (maybe even where they both overlap with y), but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: It's possible that x is completely contained in z, with x touching z's boundary. For instance, if:
   - x is a small circle on the left.
   - z is a large circle covering the entire right side and part of the left, with x touching the edge of z.
   - y is a circle that partially overlaps with both x and z, extending beyond both.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Similarly, x can be completely contained in z without touching its boundary, while y overlaps with both.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse of TPP: Z is completely contained in x, with z touching x's boundary. This can be visualized by swapping the roles of x and z in the TPP example.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse of NTPP: Z is completely contained in x without touching x's boundary. Again, swap the roles of x and z in the NTPP example.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: If x and z are the same, then they have the same relationship with y. Since y partially overlaps with x and z, there's no contradiction.

So, again, I think all 8 relations are possible.

For completeness, let me think about one more thing: what if y is contained in either x or z? Would that impose additional constraints?

If y is contained in x (TPP(y,x) or NTPP(y,x)), then PO(x,y) would not hold, as y would be a proper part of x, not a partial overlap. Similarly, if y is contained in z, then PO(y,z) would not hold.

I think my analysis is thorough, and I stand by my conclusion that all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, wait, let me look at one counterexample that I think of. Imagine y is a small circle contained in the intersection of x and z. In this case, y would be entirely contained in both x and z, which would contradict the conditions PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, it's not just about x and z, but also about the spatial relationship with y.

OK, I realized that I was overthinking this after all. I confused myself by considering scenarios where PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are not valid, but you're asking about the possible relations between x and z given that these two conditions are actually satisfied.

Let me be explicit:

PO(x,y) means there's a partial overlap between x and y, but one is not a part of the other. So PO(x,y) implies neither TPP(x,y) nor TPP(y,x) nor NTPP(x,y) nor NTPP(y,x) nor EQ(x,y) can be true.

PO(y,z) means there's a partial overlap between y and z, but one is not a part of the other. So PO(y,z) implies neither TPP(y,z) nor TPP(z,y) nor NTPP(y,z) nor NTPP(z,y) nor EQ(y,z) can be true.

Nothing in there constrains the relationship between x and z. All you know for sure is that y shares something with both x and z, but that doesn't tell us anything about what x and z share with each other.

So, my final answer is that all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to consider all possible configurations where:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap, with neither contained in the other
2. PO(y,z) - y and z partially overlap, with neither contained in the other

Given these conditions, let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This occurs when the part of y that overlaps with x is separate from the part that overlaps with z. For example, x overlaps with the left portion of y, while z overlaps with the right portion.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This occurs when x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. The overlaps with y can be arranged to allow this.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: x and z can share some interior points while each has parts outside the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: x can be completely inside z while touching z's boundary, with y partially overlapping both.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse of TPP: z can be completely inside x while touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse of NTPP: z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: x and z can be the same region, both partially overlapping with y.

All eight relations are possible because the constraints only tell us about the relationships with y, not directly about the relationship between x and z.
