PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the relations systematically.

We're given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial parts, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, meaning they share no spatial parts.

We need to determine what relations are possible between x and z. Let's think through the possible cases.

Since PO(x,y), x has some parts that are also parts of y, and some parts that are not part of y. 

Since DC(y,z), y and z are completely separate in space, sharing no parts.

So what about x and z?

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   Yes, if the part of x that overlaps with y does not intersect with z (which is guaranteed since DC(y,z)), and the part of x that doesn't overlap with y also doesn't intersect with z, then x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z externally connect?
   Yes, if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y touches z at the boundary, then x and z would externally connect.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   Yes, if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y has some common parts with z, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, if the entirety of x (both the part that overlaps with y and the part that doesn't) is contained within z, and x touches the boundary of z, then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, if the entirety of x is contained within the interior of z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   Yes, if z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Yes, if z is entirely contained within the interior of x, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   This seems unlikely. Since y and z are disconnected, and x overlaps with y, it doesn't seem possible for x to be equal to z. If x were equal to z, then z would overlap with y, contradicting DC(y,z).

Wait, I need to be more careful about some of these. Let me review:

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely contained in x. But we know that y and z are disconnected. Since x and y partially overlap, there are parts of x that are also parts of y. If z were contained in x, and some parts of x are also parts of y, then there's a risk that z might overlap with y, contradicting DC(y,z). 

But actually, it's possible for z to be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, z can be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained in z. But we know that x and y partially overlap, so some parts of x are also parts of y. If x were contained in z, and some parts of x are also parts of y, then there would be parts of z that are also parts of y, contradicting DC(y,z).

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible because it would contradict DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then there are parts of x that are also parts of z. If any of these common parts are also parts of y, then it would contradict DC(y,z). So for PO(x,z) to be possible, the overlap between x and z must be entirely outside the overlap between x and y. This seems possible.

Wait, let's take a step back and think about it more carefully. 

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

Let's denote the region that x and y share as "xy_overlap".

Since DC(y,z), y and z don't share any regions, which means "xy_overlap" and z don't share any regions either.

Now, for each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x and z have no common regions. Since "xy_overlap" and z don't share any regions (due to DC(y,z)), the only requirement is that the remainder of x (i.e., x - "xy_overlap") also doesn't share any regions with z. This is certainly possible.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior regions. Since "xy_overlap" and z don't share any regions, we need the remainder of x to touch z at the boundary. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z share some interior regions but neither is contained in the other. Since "xy_overlap" and z don't share any regions, the overlap must come from the remainder of x. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. But since "xy_overlap" is a part of x and doesn't share any regions with z (due to DC(y,z)), it's not possible for x to be entirely contained in z. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this would mean x is entirely contained in the interior of z. But since "xy_overlap" is a part of x and doesn't share any regions with z, it's not possible for x to be entirely contained in z. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is contained within the remainder of x (i.e., x - "xy_overlap").

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained in the interior of x. This is possible if z is contained within the interior of the remainder of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since "xy_overlap" is a part of x and doesn't share any regions with z, it's not possible for x to be the same as z. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this against the definitions:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Possible.
EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. Possible.
PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, but neither is contained in the other. Possible.
TPP(x,z): x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Not possible because parts of x (specifically, "xy_overlap") are outside of z.
NTPP(x,z): x is entirely within the interior of z. Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
TPPi(x,z): z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. Possible if z is within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y.
NTPPi(x,z): z is entirely within the interior of x. Possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).
EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. Not possible because parts of x (specifically, "xy_overlap") must be different from z due to DC(y,z).

Yes, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z). These are the RCC-8 relations where x and z can be arranged in a way that satisfies the given conditions.

Hmm, let's be extra careful and think about specific spatial examples to double-check this. We could think of these relations in the 2D plane for ease of visualization.

1. DC(x,z): Imagine y as a circle in the center, x as a circle that overlaps with y on the left, and z as a circle to the right of y. Here, x and z are disconnected, satisfying DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a circle in the center, x as a circle that overlaps with y on the left and extends a bit to the right to touch z, and z as a circle to the right of y. Here, x and z touch at the boundary, satisfying EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a circle in the center, x as a circle that overlaps with y on the left and has a significant extension to the right, and z as a circle to the right of y that partially overlaps with the right extension of x. Here, x and z have a region in common, but neither is contained in the other, satisfying PO(x,z).

4. TPPi(x,z): Imagine y as a circle in the center, x as a circle that overlaps with y on the left and has a significant extension to the right, and z as a circle entirely contained within the right extension of x and touching the boundary of x. Here, z is a tangential proper part of x, satisfying TPPi(x,z).

5. NTPPi(x,z): Imagine y as a circle in the center, x as a circle that overlaps with y on the left and has a significant extension to the right, and z as a circle entirely contained within the interior of the right extension of x. Here, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, satisfying NTPPi(x,z).

6. TPP(x,z): Let's try to visualize this: If x is a tangential proper part of z and also PO(x,y), then the part of x that overlaps with y would also be in z. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then the entirety of x (including the part that overlaps with y) would be in z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

I'm now confident that the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK let's formalize this a bit more carefully. Using the definition of partial overlap:

PO(x,y) means that there are points in both x and y, points in x that are not in y, and points in y that are not in x. So x∩y ≠ ∅, x - y ≠ ∅, and y - x ≠ ∅.

DC(y,z) means that y and z have no points in common, i.e., y∩z = ∅.

Given these, if x and z have a relation R, let's determine the constraints on R:

From PO(x,y), we know that x∩y ≠ ∅. From DC(y,z), we know that y∩z = ∅. Together, these imply (x∩y)∩z = ∅, which means that the overlap of x and y has no common points with z.

Now, let's go through each possible relation for R:

1. DC(x,z): This means x∩z = ∅. This is consistent with our constraints. If the entire x has no common points with z, then certainly the overlap of x and y has no common points with z. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means the interiors of x and z have no common points, but their boundaries touch. This is consistent with our constraints as the overlap of x and y can still have no common points with z even if x and z touch at their boundaries. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x∩z ≠ ∅, x - z ≠ ∅, and z - x ≠ ∅. This is consistent with our constraints as long as the overlap of x and z doesn't include any part of the overlap of x and y. In other words, as long as (x∩z)∩(x∩y) = ∅. This is indeed possible. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z and their boundaries touch. If x ⊂ z, then x∩y ⊂ z. But from our constraints, we know that (x∩y)∩z = ∅. These two conditions contradict each other. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z and their boundaries don't touch (x is in the interior of z). Similar to the TPP case, this contradicts our constraints. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x and their boundaries touch. This is consistent with our constraints as long as z doesn't overlap with x∩y. In other words, as long as z∩(x∩y) = ∅. This is certainly possible. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x and their boundaries don't touch (z is in the interior of x). This is consistent with our constraints as long as z doesn't overlap with x∩y. This is certainly possible. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If x = z, then x∩y = z∩y. But from our constraints, we know that (x∩y)∩z = ∅, which implies x∩y = ∅. This contradicts the fact that PO(x,y) implies x∩y ≠ ∅. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

(Actually, I simplified a bit above in terms of rigor, since points is not the right way to describe these relations. But I think the conclusions are correct.)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Starting facts:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some space, but neither is contained in the other)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no space at all)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Since y and z don't share any space, x can be positioned so it overlaps with y but is completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. The part of x that doesn't overlap with y can touch z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. The part of x that doesn't overlap with y can partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were entirely contained in z, then the part of x that overlaps with y would also have to be in z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be entirely contained in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be entirely contained in the interior of the part of x that doesn't overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, then z would have to partially overlap with y (since x does), contradicting DC(y,z).
