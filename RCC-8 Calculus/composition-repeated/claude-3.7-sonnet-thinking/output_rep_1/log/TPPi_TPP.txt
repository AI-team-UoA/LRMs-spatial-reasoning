PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 spatial relations that could hold between objects x and z given the conditions TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's analyze what these conditions mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

So we have:
- y is part of x and touches x's boundary
- y is part of z and touches z's boundary

I need to determine what relations could hold between x and z given these conditions. Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected (touching but no overlap)
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Let's analyze each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y cannot be part of both x and z, since that would mean x and z share at least the part y. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected (touching at the boundary), and y is part of both x and z, then y would need to be located exactly at the point where x and z touch. This is possible if y touches the boundaries of both x and z.

3. PO(x,z): Since y is part of both x and z, x and z must share at least the region y. So partial overlap is definitely possible.

4. TPP(x,z): It's possible that x is a tangential proper part of z, with y being part of x.

5. NTPP(x,z): It's possible that x is completely inside z without touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): It's possible that z is a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): It's possible that z is completely inside x without touching its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): It's possible that x and z are the same region.

Let me double-check each of these by considering specific examples:

1. DC(x,z): Ruled out already.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, and y is part of both, then y must be exactly at the point of contact. Since y must touch the boundaries of both x and z (due to TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z)), this seems geometrically possible.

3. PO(x,z): Clearly possible - x and z partially overlap, and y is in the overlap region, touching the boundaries of both.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, and y is a proper part of x touching x's boundary, then y is necessarily a proper part of z. If y touches the part of x's boundary that also forms part of z's boundary, then y would touch z's boundary too. So this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, but y touches x's boundary, y would still be completely inside z. But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch z's boundary, which wouldn't be possible if x (and hence y) is completely inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is ruled out.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, and y is a proper part of z touching z's boundary, then y is necessarily a proper part of x. If y touches the part of z's boundary that also forms part of x's boundary, then y would touch x's boundary too. So this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is completely inside z, then y cannot touch x's boundary as required by TPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is ruled out.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, and y is a tangential proper part of both, that's consistent with our constraints.

Let me recheck the ones I've ruled out to be sure:

5. NTPP(x,z): Actually, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Even if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, y could still touch z's boundary while being inside x, as long as y touches x's boundary at a point that's not on z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, y could still be inside z and touch both z's boundary and x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let's think about these spatial relations more precisely:

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x (all of y is inside x, and y ≠ x)
- y touches x's boundary (there is at least one point where y and the boundary of x meet)

If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is a proper part of z (all of y is inside z, and y ≠ z)
- y touches z's boundary (there is at least one point where y and the boundary of z meet)

Now let's reconsider each RCC-8 relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z) would mean x and z have no points in common. But since y is part of both x and z, x and z must share at least the region occupied by y. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z) would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. However, since y is a proper part of both x and z, y represents a common interior part of x and z. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z) would mean x and z partially overlap - they share some points but neither is contained in the other. Since y is part of both x and z, they do share some points. But for PO to be true, neither x nor z can be fully contained in the other. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) would mean all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. This is possible - y can be a tangential proper part of x, and x can be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) would mean all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. For y to be a tangential proper part of z, y must touch z's boundary. But if x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, how can y, which is inside x, touch z's boundary? It can't, so NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z) would mean all of z is inside x, and z touches x's boundary. This is possible - y can be a tangential proper part of z, and z can be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) would mean all of z is inside x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary. For y to be a tangential proper part of x, y must touch x's boundary. But if z is completely inside x without touching its boundary, and y is inside z, how can y touch x's boundary? It can't, so NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) would mean x and z occupy exactly the same region. This is possible - y can be a tangential proper part of both x and z if x and z are the same region.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Let me double-check with a different approach:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), let's think about specific examples:

1. TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
2. TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

- If x is larger than z and they partially overlap, y could be in the overlap region, touching both of their boundaries. This gives PO(x,z).
- If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary at the point where x touches z's boundary, this gives TPP(x,z).
- If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary at the point where z touches x's boundary, this gives TPPi(x,z).
- If x and z are the same region, and y is a proper part of both touching their boundaries, this gives EQ(x,z).

But now I'm having doubts about NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider:

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is inside x touching x's boundary, can y also touch z's boundary? No, because if y touches z's boundary while being inside x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then y would extend beyond x to reach z's boundary. This contradicts y being a proper part of x. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, can y also touch x's boundary? No, for the same reason. So NTPPi(x,z) is also impossible.

So my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Actually, I realize I need to think about this more carefully. I need to consider the transitivity table of RCC-8 relations.

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we want to know the possible relations between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). So we have TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z).

Let me try to reason through this carefully:

1. TPP(y,x) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

So y is a proper part of both x and z, and touches both of their boundaries.

case 1: If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).
case 2: If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) or equivalently TPP(z,x).
case 3: If neither x nor z is a proper part of the other, but they share some part (at least y), then PO(x,z).
case 4: If x and z are the same region, then EQ(x,z).

Are there other cases I'm missing? Let's check the remaining RCC-8 relations:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because they share at least y.
EC(x,z): x and z touch but don't overlap. This is impossible because they share at least y.
NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this possible? If y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary (at the point where y touches both). So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.
NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. By similar reasoning, this is impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I just realized I need to be even more careful in my reasoning, especially for NTPP and NTPPi.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, can y be inside x, touch x's boundary, and also touch z's boundary? Yes, this is geometrically possible if y extends within x to touch x's boundary, and also extends within x in another direction to touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, can y be inside z, touch z's boundary, and also touch x's boundary? Yes, for similar reasons. So NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

So my revised answer is that the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Hmm, this is starting to include most of the relations. Let me double-check my reasoning, especially for NTPP and NTPPi, with more precise thinking.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary, then there's a path from y to z's boundary. This path must pass through x's boundary (since y is inside x). But if x doesn't touch z's boundary, this path would have to continue outside of x to reach z's boundary, which contradicts y being contained entirely within x. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

For NTPPi(x,z): By similar reasoning, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches both z's boundary and x's boundary, then there's a path from a point on z's boundary to x's boundary. But this path would have to pass outside of z, which contradicts y being contained entirely within z. So NTPPi(x,z) is also impossible.

So I revert to my earlier conclusion: the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Wait, I think I was making a subtle error in my reasoning above. Let me think again for the NTPP case: If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary, can y also touch z's boundary? If y can reach through x's boundary to touch z's boundary, then y would not be completely contained in x. But if y touches x's boundary from within, and that part of x's boundary is close to but not touching z's boundary, then we'd have that y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary. But we need y to touch z's boundary for TPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary from within, then y is still completely inside x and can't reach x's boundary. But TPPi(x,y) requires y to touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is also impossible.

I'm now confident that the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Let me try one more way to double-check:

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. If I draw this, x would be a larger region and y would be a smaller region inside x, touching x's boundary at at least one point.

If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. If I draw this, z would be a larger region and y would be a smaller region inside z, touching z's boundary at at least one point.

Now, given these constraints, what can the relationship between x and z be?

1. x and z could partially overlap, with y in the overlap region. This gives PO(x,z).
2. x could be a tangential proper part of z. This gives TPP(x,z).
3. z could be a tangential proper part of x. This gives TPPi(x,z).
4. x and z could be the same region. This gives EQ(x,z).

Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, because if y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, and y is inside x, then x must also touch z's boundary.

Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? No, for similar reasons.

Can x and z be disconnected? No, because they share at least y.

Can x and z be externally connected? No, because they share at least y, which is in their interiors.

So my final answer remains:
The possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Actually, I now realize I can refer to the composition table for RCC-8 relations. The composition of TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would give the possible relations between x and z.

From TPPi(x,y), we have TPP(y,x).

The composition of TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z) would be the set of possible relations for (x,z).

According to the composition table for RCC-8, the composition of TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z) is:
{PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}

But I've been arguing above that NTPP and NTPPi are impossible in this case. Let me double-check my reasoning:

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, can y be a tangential proper part of both x and z? For y to be a TPP of x, y must touch x's boundary. For y to be a TPP of z, y must touch z's boundary. But if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is completely inside x, how can y touch z's boundary? It would have to extend beyond x, which contradicts y being a TPP of x.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, can y be a tangential proper part of both x and z? For y to be a TPP of x, y must touch x's boundary. For y to be a TPP of z, y must touch z's boundary. But if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is completely inside z, how can y touch x's boundary? It would have to extend beyond z, which contradicts y being a TPP of z.

So from the composition table as well as my geometric reasoning, it seems that the possible relations for (x,z) are:
{PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ}

Actually, I realize that I need to draw out the full picture to understand the NTPP and NTPPi cases better.

For NTPP(x,z): 
- x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
- y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- y is also a tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

The key question is: Can y touch both x's boundary and z's boundary if x doesn't touch z's boundary?

If y touches a part of x's boundary that's far from z's boundary, then y can't touch z's boundary without extending beyond x, which contradicts y being a part of x. So in this case, y can't satisfy both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
- z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- y is also a tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

The key question is: Can y touch both x's boundary and z's boundary if z doesn't touch x's boundary?

If y is inside z, and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then y is separated from x's boundary by a "buffer zone" of z. So y can't touch x's boundary without extending beyond z, which contradicts y being a part of z. So in this case, y can't satisfy both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

I'm now convinced that NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are indeed impossible given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Actually, now I need to double-check the composition table for RCC-8. The composition of TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would give the possible relations between x and z.

According to various sources I'm familiar with, the composition of TPPi and TPP includes:
{PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}

The fact that this includes NTPP and NTPPi suggests that my reasoning above might be incomplete. Let me try to make a case for NTPP:

Consider a circle z with a smaller circle x inside it, not touching the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z). Now, let y be a region inside x that extends to touch the boundary of x and also extends, within x, to touch the boundary of z. Then TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Wait, this doesn't make sense. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is completely inside x, how can y touch z's boundary? It would have to extend beyond x, which contradicts y being inside x.

The same issue arises for NTPPi.

Maybe there's an issue with the composition table I was thinking of, or I'm missing some subtlety.

Let's try another approach. Let's visualize specific examples for each of the possible relations:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. y is in the overlap region and touches both x's boundary and z's boundary.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. y is inside x and touches x's boundary at the point where x touches z's boundary. y also touches z's boundary.

3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. y is inside z and touches z's boundary at the point where z touches x's boundary. y also touches x's boundary.

4. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. y is inside both and touches their common boundary.

Now let's try to think of examples for NTPP and NTPPi:

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. y is inside x and touches x's boundary. But how can y also touch z's boundary if x doesn't touch z's boundary? It would have to extend beyond x, which contradicts y being inside x.

6. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is inside z and touches z's boundary. But how can y also touch x's boundary if z doesn't touch x's boundary? It would have to extend beyond z, which contradicts y being inside z.

So it still seems to me that NTPP and NTPPi are impossible.

However, the standard composition table does list NTPP and NTPPi as possible outcomes of composing TPPi and TPP. Perhaps there's a specific configuration I'm not seeing? Let me try another approach.

Actually, I just thought of a possible configuration that might allow y to touch both x's and z's boundaries even in the NTPP case:

Imagine z as a big circle, x as a smaller circle inside z but not touching z's boundary (so NTPP(x,z)), and y as a "C" shaped region inside x that wraps around x from the inside and touches x's boundary at one end and extends to touch z's boundary at the other end. But no, this doesn't work, because if y extends to touch z's boundary, it must pass through x's boundary, which means y isn't completely inside x.

I'm increasingly convinced that NTPP and NTPPi are indeed impossible outcomes of composing TPPi and TPP.

So I maintain that the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Actually, upon further reflection, I think my reasoning is correct and the composition table might be using a more general definition that doesn't handle this specific case correctly.

Let's summarize what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If y is inside x, how can y touch z's boundary without passing through x's boundary? And if y passes through x's boundary, then y isn't completely inside x, which contradicts both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Similarly, if NTPPi(x,z), then z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If y is inside z, how can y touch x's boundary without passing through z's boundary? And if y passes through z's boundary, then y isn't completely inside z, which contradicts both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

It seems to me that NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are inconsistent with the given conditions.

So the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Alright, let's try again, working with the core RCC-8 definitions:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

If y is a proper part of both x and z (due to TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z)), then x and z must share at least the region occupied by y. So DC and EC are ruled out.

If y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, then x and z can be related in the following ways:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, with y in the overlap region.
2. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary, with y inside x.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary, with y inside z.
4. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region, with y inside both.

Can NTPP(x,z) be the case? If x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is inside x, how can y touch z's boundary? Well, it can't. So NTPP(x,z) is ruled out.

Can NTPPi(x,z) be the case? If z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, how can y touch x's boundary? It can't. So NTPPi(x,z) is also ruled out.

So, again, the possible relations are:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

I think this list is correct and consistent with the formal definitions of RCC-8 relations.

TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships can hold between x and z given the conditions TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me analyze what these conditions mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

So y is inside both x and z, and touches both of their boundaries.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation for (x,z):

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because x and z must share at least region y.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible because x and z share region y, which is part of both their interiors.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z partially overlap with y in the overlap region.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be inside z touching z's boundary, with y inside x.

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible - if x is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (being inside x) cannot touch z's boundary without extending beyond x.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be inside x touching x's boundary, with y inside z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible - if z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (being inside z) cannot touch x's boundary without extending beyond z.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be identical, with y as a tangential proper part of both.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
