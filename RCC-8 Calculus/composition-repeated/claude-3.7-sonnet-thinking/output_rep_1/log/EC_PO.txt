PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm asked to find the possible RCC8 relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and PO(y,z). 

Let's break down what we know:
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

I need to determine what this tells us about the relationship between x and z.

Since EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch but don't overlap. Since PO(y,z), we know that y and z partially overlap.

Let's consider each possible RCC8 relation between x and z and determine if it's consistent with the given information:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected.
This is possible. x could be disconnected from z if the part of y that touches x is different from the part of y that overlaps with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected.
This is possible. x could touch z at a boundary if the part of y that touches x also overlaps with z, and that boundary of y is shared with z.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping.
This is possible. x could partially overlap with z if the part of y that touches x extends inside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part.
This is possible. x could be a tangential proper part of z if x is along the boundary of z, and y overlaps with both x and parts of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part.
This is not possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained in the interior of z. But since EC(x,y), x must touch the boundary of y. It's inconsistent for x to both touch the boundary of y and be completely contained in the interior of z, given that y and z are in a PO relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part.
This is possible. z could be a tangential proper part of x if z is along the boundary of x, and y overlaps with both parts of x and z.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part.
This is possible. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x if z is completely contained in the interior of x, and y overlaps with parts of x and all of z.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal.
This is not possible. If x and z are equal, then since EC(x,y), we'd have EC(z,y). But we're given PO(y,z), which contradicts EC(z,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, I need to reconsider some of these.

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), y must touch x at its boundary. Since PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z. It's possible that the part of y that touches x is at the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

For TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and given that PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z. But since EC(x,y), y only touches x at its boundary. This creates a contradiction: the part of y that overlaps with z would need to be both inside x (since z is inside x) and at the boundary of x (since y only touches x at its boundary). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and given that PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z. Again, since EC(x,y), y only touches x at its boundary. This creates the same contradiction as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me rethink this problem more carefully:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior points.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, but neither is wholly contained in the other.

For each RCC8 relation between x and z, I'll check if it's consistent with the given constraints:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) if the part of y that touches x doesn't overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   If x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points, this is consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) if the part of y that touches x also touches the boundary of z. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   If x and z share some interior points but neither is wholly contained in the other, this is consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) if the part of y that touches x overlaps with the interior of z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, this is consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) if the part of y that touches x also touches the boundary of z, and y partially overlaps with z elsewhere. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   If x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is entirely in the interior of z. Since EC(x,y), y touches x at its boundary. But this would mean that y has to reach into the interior of z (to touch x). Since PO(y,z), y does have parts inside z, so this is consistent. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then given that EC(x,y), y touches x at its boundary. And given that PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z. For this to be consistent, the part of y that overlaps with z must be the same part that touches the boundary of x, and z must touch the boundary of x at the same place. While this is geometrically complex, I believe it's possible. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   If z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z is entirely in the interior of x. Given that PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z, which means y has parts inside the interior of x. But given that EC(x,y), y only touches x at its boundary, and doesn't have parts inside x. This contradiction means that NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   If x and z are the same region, then since EC(x,y), we'd have EC(z,y). But we're given PO(y,z), which contradicts EC(z,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi.

Actually, let's think again about TPPi(x,z). This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z, meaning y and z share some interior points. But since EC(x,y), y only touches x at its boundary, and they don't share interior points. This seems contradictory: for y to overlap with z, y would need to have interior points inside x (since z is inside x), but EC(x,y) says y can't have interior points inside x.

So I think TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let's also double-check NTPP(x,z). This would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so x is contained in the interior of z, not touching z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), y touches x at its boundary. For y to touch x, which is inside z, y would need to reach inside z. Since PO(y,z), y does have parts inside z, so this is consistent. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Given the constraints EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Let me double-check each of these for consistency.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, and the part of y that touches x doesn't overlap with z. This is consistent.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary, and the part of y that touches x also touches the boundary of z. This is consistent.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some interior points, and the part of y that touches x overlaps with the interior of z. This is consistent.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, and the part of y that touches x also touches the boundary of z. This is consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y reaches inside z to touch x. This is consistent.

So the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to be careful about TPPi(x,z), which would mean z is a tangential proper part of x.

Let's think about it differently. If z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)), then z is wholly contained in x, and z touches the boundary of x. Since PO(y,z), y and z share interior points, which means y also has points inside x. But since EC(x,y), y only touches the boundary of x and doesn't have interior points inside x. This is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's think about NTPP(x,z), which would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely inside the interior of z, not touching z's boundary, and given that EC(x,y), y touches the boundary of x. This means y has parts inside z (to reach x). This is consistent with PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Let's talk through a different relation more concretely to check our understanding:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries, no overlap
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap

If the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), then x and z don't touch or overlap. This is possible in a configuration where the part of y that touches x doesn't overlap with z, and the part of y that overlaps with z doesn't touch x. Here's a simple example:

Imagine three circles (well, actually regions, but circles help for visualizing):
- x is a circle on the left
- y is a circle in the middle, touching x at a point
- z is a circle on the right, partially overlapping with y
- x and z are disconnected (DC)

If the relationship between x and z is EC(x,z), then x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if the part of y that touches x also touches the boundary of z. For example:

- x is a circle on the left
- z is a circle on the right
- y is a shape that extends from the left (where it touches x) to the right (where it partially overlaps with z)
- x and z touch at a point (EC)

If the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z), then x and z partially overlap. This is possible if the part of y that touches x extends into an area where z also exists. For example:

- x is a circle on the left
- z is a larger circle that extends from the middle to the right
- y is a shape that touches the boundary of x, and extends rightward where it partially overlaps with z
- x and z overlap in the middle area (PO)

If the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if y touches x at the same boundary point where x touches z. For example:

- z is a large circle
- x is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at the left
- y is a shape that touches the boundary of x at the left, exactly where x touches z, and extends to the right where it overlaps with parts of z
- x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP)

If the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if y reaches inside z to touch the boundary of x. For example:

- z is a large circle
- x is a smaller circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary
- y is a shape that extends from outside z, crosses z's boundary, and touches x's boundary
- x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)

In each of these cases, EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are satisfied, and the relationship between x and z is as described. So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me verify one more thing. The relationship between x and z can't be TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) because these would require that z is contained in x, which, combined with PO(y,z), would force y to have interior points inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

Let me double check once more, focusing on the relations I'm not sure about.

For NTPP(x,z), I want to ensure that this is a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so x is entirely inside the interior of z.

Given EC(x,y), y touches the boundary of x but doesn't share interior points with x.

Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is wholly contained in the other.

For NTPP(x,z) to be consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), y would need to reach inside z to touch the boundary of x. This is possible given PO(y,z), as y can have parts inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

Now, double check TPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), y touches the boundary of x but doesn't share interior points with x.

Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is wholly contained in the other.

For TPP(x,z) to be consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), y would need to touch the boundary of x at a point where x also touches the boundary of z, and y could also have parts that overlap with the interior of z elsewhere. This seems possible, so TPP(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I wish to do a final check on the TPP(x,z) relation. I initially thought this was consistent, but I'm having doubts. Let's think it through again.

TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), y touches the boundary of x but doesn't share interior points with x.

Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is wholly contained in the other.

For TPP(x,z) to be consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), I need to consider how y can both touch the boundary of x and partially overlap with z, while x is a tangential proper part of z.

Given that x is a tangential proper part of z, the boundary of x that touches the boundary of z is also a part of the boundary of z. The rest of the boundary of x is inside z.

Now, given EC(x,y), y touches x at the boundary of x. This could be at the part of the boundary of x that is also the boundary of z, or it could be at a part of the boundary of x that is inside z.

If y touches x at the part of the boundary of x that is also the boundary of z, then y touches the boundary of z at that point. Given PO(y,z), y also has parts that are inside z, which is consistent.

If y touches x at a part of the boundary of x that is inside z, then y has parts inside z. Again, this is consistent with PO(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Before submitting my final answer, let me double-check the TPPi(x,z) relation one more time to make sure it's truly inconsistent.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x, or TPP(z,x). So, z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points.

Given EC(x,y), y touches the boundary of x but doesn't share interior points with x.

For TPPi(x,z) to be consistent with PO(y,z) and EC(x,y), I need to check if it's possible for y to both touch the boundary of x (EC(x,y)) and share interior points with z (PO(y,z)), while z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

If z is inside x and touches x's boundary at some point p, then for y to overlap with z, y would need to have interior points inside z, which means y would have interior points inside x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says y only touches the boundary of x and doesn't share interior points with x.

This confirms my earlier conclusion: TPPi(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), I'll analyze what these constraints allow:

EC(x,y) means:
- x and y touch at their boundaries
- x and y do not share interior points

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z partially overlap
- They share interior points
- Neither is contained within the other

Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. The part of y that touches x can be separate from the part that overlaps with z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries if the part of y that touches x also touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, consistent with the constraints.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z, with y reaching into z to touch x.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were inside x, then y would need interior points inside x to overlap with z, contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same contradiction as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) would be contradictory.
