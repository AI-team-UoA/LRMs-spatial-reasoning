PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

We have:
1. NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x.
2. EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are equal or coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).

Now, let's figure out the relationship between x and z.

Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), they have the same spatial extent. And since y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,y)), it means that y is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x.

By substitution (because y and z are the same), z is also completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. This is exactly the definition of NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I need to make sure I understand the directionality of NTPPi. 

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x).

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(y,x).
2. EQ(y,z): This means y and z are equal.

Since y and z are equal, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This gives us NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just make sure with a different way of thinking.

NTPPi(x, y) means that "y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary". EQ(y, z) means that y and z are coincident. 

Thus, z is also "part of x but does not touch x's boundary", which is defined as NTPP(z, x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x, z). 

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, hold on. Let me really double check the definition.

I see that I was being sloppy in my understanding. Let me get this straight:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x), which means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

OK so NTPPi(x, y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let's verify this new understanding:

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Equivalently, NTPP(y,x).
2. EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are coincident (they occupy the same space), any relation that y has with x, z will also have with x. 

If y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is also a non-tangential proper part of x.

Thus, NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me try once more, to make this absolutely clear. We're trying to compute the composition of NTPPi(x, y) and EQ(y, z) to determine the relationship between x and z.

Let's use a geographic example. Let's say x is the United States, y is Alabama, and z is also Alabama. Then NTPPi(x, y) means that Alabama (y) is a non-tangential proper part of the United States (x). And EQ(y, z) means that y and z are the same state, Alabama. So clearly, z is also a non-tangential proper part of the United States (x), which gives us NTPPi(x, z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But actually I think my sloppy understanding was correct, and now I'm getting confused again. Let's re-review the definitions:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, x is contained entirely within y and does not touch the boundary of y.
NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), so it means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (or equivalently, NTPP(y,x)). That is, y is contained entirely within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

So:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region.

So, if y is a non-tangential proper part of x, and z is the same as y, then z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

OK so the answer is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, let's approach this directly from the definitions to avoid confusion:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse, meaning NTPP(y,x). It means y is part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident.

Given NTPPi(x,y): y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
Given EQ(y,z): y and z are the same.
Therefore, z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the final answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually wait, let me try this with a more precise approach. Let's make sure I understand the composition of relations.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region.

Now, let's compute NTPPi(x,y) ∘ EQ(y,z) to find the relation between x and z.

For any regions a, b, and c, if R1(a,b) and R2(b,c), then the composition R1 ∘ R2 gives us the relation between a and c.

In our case, the composition NTPPi(x,y) ∘ EQ(y,z) gives us the relation between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same, all relations that y has with other regions, z also has. Therefore, if y is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), then z is also properly contained in x without touching x's boundary.

Thus, NTPPi(x,y) ∘ EQ(y,z) = NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let's double-check with concrete examples:

Imagine x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside x (not touching the boundary of x), and z is the same as y. Then, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, our final answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I am making this more complicated than it should be.

NTPPi(x,y) means "y is a non-tangential proper part of x".
EQ(y,z) means "y and z are coincident".

Since y and z are the same (EQ(y,z)), and y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,y)), it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same.

Since y and z are the same, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x, giving us NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z are coincident (they are the same region), and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, it follows that z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is:
