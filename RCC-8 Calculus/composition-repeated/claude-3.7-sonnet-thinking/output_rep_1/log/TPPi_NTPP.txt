PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x, and y touches x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is a proper part of z, and y does not touch z's boundary.

I need to find the possible relationships between x and z. Let me reason through this.

We have:
1. TPPi(x,y): y is tangential proper part of x, meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, I need to figure out how x and z could be related. 

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. x and z could be disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z). But if y is part of x and y is part of z, then x and z must share at least region y. So they can't be disconnected.

2. x and z could be externally connected, i.e., EC(x,z). 
   - But if y is part of x and y is part of z, then x and z share the region y, which is more than just their boundaries touching. 
   - So, x and z can't be just externally connected.

3. x and z could partially overlap, i.e., PO(x,z). 
   - This is definitely possible. If y is a proper part of both x and z, and x and z have some parts that don't overlap.
   - So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(x,z). 
   - This is possible if x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
   - We know y is part of x and y is part of z, but not touching z's boundary. This doesn't give us enough information to rule out TPP(x,z).
   - Actually, wait. Let me reason more carefully. If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then y is part of x and y is part of z. I'm not sure if this directly implies a relationship between x and z. But let's try to reason it out.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z). 
   - This is possible if x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - Again, the fact that y is part of x and y is part of z doesn't give us enough to definitively say whether x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me try to visualize this. If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y is within both x and z, and y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z.

Actually, let me re-analyze this more carefully:

Given TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x (all points in y are in x, but not all points in x are in y).
- y touches the boundary of x.

Given NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is a proper part of z (all points in y are in z, but not all points in z are in y).
- y does not touch the boundary of z.

So, we have:
- y is a proper part of x.
- y is a proper part of z.
- y touches the boundary of x.
- y does not touch the boundary of z.

This gives us some constraints, but I need to think about all possible relationships between x and z.

I think I can rule out:
- DC(x,z): Disconnected, because they both have y as a common part.
- EC(x,z): Externally connected, because they share more than just their boundaries; they share y.
- EQ(x,z): Equal, because y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, so x and z can't be the same.

That leaves:
- PO(x,z): Partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me analyze each of these remaining possibilities:

PO(x,z): Possible. If x and z share some parts (definitely y, at least) but neither is a proper part of the other, this is partially overlapping.

TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, this means all of x is contained in z, and x touches the boundary of z. Given that y (which is a part of x) does not touch the boundary of z, it's possible for other parts of x to touch the boundary of z, so this is possible.

NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, this means all of x is contained in z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. This is possible.

TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, this means all of z is contained in x, and z touches the boundary of x. But we know that y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x, which implies z also touches the boundary of x. So, this is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, this means all of z is contained in x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. But we know that y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x, which implies z also touches the boundary of x. This contradicts the definition of NTPPi, so it's not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Wait, let me recheck NTPPi(x,z). I need to be more careful. NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. We know that y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x. If y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x, then z must also have a point that touches the boundary of x (since z contains y). This contradicts the definition of NTPPi. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully contained within x and touches the boundary of x. We know that y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x. This is consistent with TPPi(x,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship between x and z.

However, I need to be more careful about the implications of TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, y is inside z and does not touch the boundary of z.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): Not possible, as x and z both contain y.
2. EC(x,z) (Externally connected): Not possible, as x and z share more than just their boundaries; they share y.
3. PO(x,z) (Partially overlap): Possible, as x and z both contain y, but might also have exclusive parts.
4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z): Possible, if all of x is contained in z and x touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z): Possible, if all of x is contained in z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): Possible, if all of z is contained in x and z touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): Not possible, as we've reasoned above. If y (part of z) touches the boundary of x, then z must also touch the boundary of x, contradicting the definition of NTPPi.
8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): Not possible, because y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z.

Actually, let me be careful even about TPPi(x,z). TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x. We know y is inside z and touches the boundary of x. But this is a bit tricky. It's not clear from the given information that all of z is inside x or part of x. We know y is shared between x and z, but z might extend beyond x.

Actually wait. Let me think again about TPPi(x,y). This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

Let's first the fully understand the implications of TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):
- TPPi(x,y): y is tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z): y is non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, y is inside both x and z, but y touches the boundary of x while not touching the boundary of z.

From this, I can infer:
- x and z share at least the region of y, so they are connected.
- y touches the boundary of x, but doesn't touch the boundary of z, which suggests that z extends beyond x at those points where y touches the boundary of x.

Given these inferences, let's reconsider the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): Not possible, as x and z both contain y.
2. EC(x,z) (Externally connected): Not possible, as x and z share more than just their boundaries; they share y.
3. PO(x,z) (Partially overlap): Possible, as x and z both contain y, but might also have exclusive parts.
4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z): Possible, if all of x is contained in z and x touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z): Possible, if all of x is contained in z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): Let me reconsider this.

Let me think about TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x. 

We know:
- y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)).
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).

If z is fully inside x, and y (which is inside z) touches the boundary of x, then z must also touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with TPPi(x,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship between x and z.

But I think I need to be even more careful here. We know y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)). We also know that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)). If z is fully inside x, then y being inside z means y is inside x, which is consistent. If y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, would z also touch the boundary of x? Not necessarily. Z could be fully inside x, and y (a part of z) could touch the boundary of x while z itself doesn't touch the boundary of x. No, I think I'm getting confused here. If y is inside z and y touches the boundary of x, then there's a part of z that touches the boundary of x, which means z touches the boundary of x.

I think this is right: Since y is inside z and y touches the boundary of x, it implies that z touches the boundary of x. This is consistent with TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x). So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship between x and z.

Let's continue:

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is fully inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. But we've just reasoned that if y (which is inside z) touches the boundary of x, then z must also touch the boundary of x. This contradicts the definition of NTPPi, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): This would mean x and z are the same. But we know y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, which means x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Wait, let me re-examine TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z). This would mean x is fully inside z and touches the boundary of z. 

We know:
- y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)).

If x is fully inside z, and y (which is inside x) doesn't touch the boundary of z, does that mean x doesn't touch the boundary of z? Not necessarily. The parts of x that are not y could still touch the boundary of z, so it doesn't contradict TPP(x,z). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship between x and z.

Now, let's re-examine NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z). This would mean x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. 

We know:
- y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)).

If x is fully inside z, and y (which is inside x) doesn't touch the boundary of z, does that mean x doesn't touch the boundary of z? Again, not necessarily. X could still touch the boundary of z with parts that are not y. So, NTPP(x,z) remains a possibility.

But actually, I just realized something. If y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)) and x is inside z, and y is inside z but doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x must not touch the boundary of z at the points where y touches the boundary of x. This suggests that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or in other words, NTPP(x,z) is true.

Wait, this doesn't quite seem right. Let me reason using another approach.

Let's consider circles as our spatial regions for simplicity.

Scenario 1: Imagine x is a circle, and y is a smaller circle touching the boundary of x. Since TPPi(x,y), y is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x.

Scenario 2: Now, imagine z is a bigger circle, and y is a smaller circle inside z and not touching the boundary of z. Since NTPP(y,z), y is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Combining the two: We have x, y, and z. Y is fully inside both x and z. Y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. From this visualization, I can see that where y touches the boundary of x, z must extend beyond x. This suggests z isn't inside x; rather, it seems more likely that x is inside z. 

Given that y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z and y is inside both, the most consistent relationship seems to be NTPP(x,z). This would mean x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. 

Let's double-check this:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

I think I've been overthinking this and the answer is, as I suspected, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z). 

Now, let me visually trace through all the relationships:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): Not possible, as x and z both contain y.
2. EC(x,z) (Externally connected): Not possible, as x and z share more than just their boundaries; they share y.
3. PO(x,z) (Partially overlap): If x and z both contain y but also have exclusive parts, this would be partially overlapping. 

Actually, hold on a sec. I've been going back and forth between different ideas, so let me recenter and approach this one more time.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

From the first relationship, we know y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. From the second, we know y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

For the relationship between x and z, we know:
- They share at least the region of y, so they are connected.
- Where y touches the boundary of x, z must extend beyond x, because y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these constraints, let's systematically examine all possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): Not possible, as they share y.
2. EC(x,z) (Externally connected): Not possible, as they share y, which is a region with non-zero interior.
3. PO(x,z) (Partially overlap): Possible, as x and z both contain y, but might also have exclusive parts. But actually, this might not be consistent with the constraint that z must extend beyond x where y touches the boundary of x.
4. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z): Possible, if all of x is contained in z and x touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z): Possible, if all of x is contained in z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x. But this contradicts the constraint that z must extend beyond x where y touches the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): This would mean z is fully inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, this contradicts the constraint that z must extend beyond x where y touches the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.
8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): This would mean x and z are the same. But we know y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, which means x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let's further analyze PO(x,z) (Partially overlap). If x and z partially overlap, then there are parts of x that are outside of z and parts of z that are outside of x. 

Actually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully. 

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x at some point, let's call it p. At point p, y and the boundary of x intersect, but immediately outside that point (outside of x), there's no part of y.

If NTPP(y,z), then y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. There's a "buffer" region between y and the boundary of z.

Now, at point p, y touches the boundary of x. But y doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means that at point p, z extends beyond the boundary of x. Since this is true for all points where y touches the boundary of x, z extends beyond x at all these points.

Given this, let's re-analyze the relationships:

1. PO(x,z) (Partially overlap): This would mean there's a part of x outside of z. But from our analysis, at all points where y touches the boundary of x, z extends beyond x. Would this rule out PO? Not necessarily. There could be parts of the boundary of x not touched by y, and at those parts, z might not extend beyond x. So, PO(x,z) is still possible.

2. TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z): This would mean x is fully inside z and touches the boundary of z. Since z extends beyond x at all points where y touches the boundary of x, if this is the entire boundary of x, then x would be inside z. But x could still touch the boundary of z at other points. So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

3. NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z): This would mean x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Since z extends beyond x at all points where y touches the boundary of x, if this is the entire boundary of x and z extends far enough, then x would be non-tangentially inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Based on the constraints, the possibilities for the relationship between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's try to narrow it down further:

If y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)), then there's a buffer region in z around y. This buffer region extends beyond the boundary of x. If we consider that x and z might have other relationships and regions not affected by y, then PO(x,z) is possible.

Alright, after all the analysis, I'm most confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let's try to draw a picture for PO(x,z) where TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.
PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.

Given TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given NTPP(y,z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, where y touches the boundary of x, z must extend beyond the boundary of x.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap, so there are parts of x outside of z and parts of z outside of x.

Let's imagine a picture:
- x is a circle.
- y is a smaller circle fully inside x and touching the boundary of x.
- z is another circle, not concentric with x, but large enough to fully contain y with a buffer around it. z and x overlap, but z extends beyond the boundary of x in the direction where y touches the boundary of x, and x extends beyond the boundary of z in the opposite direction.

In this picture, TPPi(x,y), NTPP(y,z), and PO(x,z) all hold.

So I think this reaffirms my conclusion. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

In conclusion, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is fully contained in x
- y touches the boundary of x

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is fully contained in z
- y does not touch the boundary of z

From these relations, I can determine that:
- x and z must share at least region y, so they cannot be disconnected (DC)
- They share more than just boundary points, so they're not externally connected (EC)
- Since y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary, x and z cannot be equal (EQ)
- Since y is inside z but touches x's boundary, z must extend beyond x at those points where y touches x's boundary

Based on these constraints, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
