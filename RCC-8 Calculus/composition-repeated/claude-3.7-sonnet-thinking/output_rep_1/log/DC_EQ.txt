PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We're given that DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), and we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze the given information:
1. DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, or in other words, y and z are the same spatial region.

Since y and z are the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. 

Given that DC(x,y), and y and z are the same spatial region, it follows that x and z must also be disconnected.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine how the relationships DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are exactly the same region, any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. EQ is essentially an identity relation in spatial terms.

Therefore, if x is disconnected from y (DC), and y is identical to z (EQ), then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
