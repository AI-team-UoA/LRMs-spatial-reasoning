PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

The question asks us to reason about the possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between regions x and z given that TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's break down what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. That is, they share some interior part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I'll think through this systematically.

Since TPPi(x,y), we know that y is inside x (touching x's boundary). Since PO(y,z), we know that z overlaps with y, but is not fully contained in y, and y is not fully contained in z.

Given that z partially overlaps with y, and y is inside x, we have a few possibilities:
1. z could be partially inside x and partially outside x, which would mean PO(x,z).
2. z could be completely inside x but not touching x's boundary, which would mean NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).
3. z could be completely inside x and touching x's boundary, which would mean TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).
4. z could be equal to x, which would mean EQ(x,z).
5. x could be completely inside z, but this would contradict our givens because we know y is completely inside x, and z only partially overlaps with y.
6. z could be disconnected from x, but this would contradict our givens because z overlaps with y, and y is inside x.
7. z could be externally connected to x, but again this contradicts our givens because z overlaps with y, and y is inside x.

Let's double-check our reasoning by considering the constraints more carefully:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is fully inside x, touching x's boundary.
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. So z has a part inside y and a part outside y.

Given these constraints:
- The part of z that's inside y must also be inside x (since y is inside x).
- The part of z that's outside y could be inside x or outside x.

If the part of z that's outside y is also inside x, then either:
- TPP(z,x) / TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (if z touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(z,x) / NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (if z doesn't touch x's boundary)
- EQ(x,z): z is equal to x (if z exactly coincides with x)

If the part of z that's outside y is also outside x, then:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (since part of z is inside x via y, and part is outside x)

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I think we need to be more careful. Let me draw this out more carefully to ensure I haven't missed anything.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x, touching x's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (part of z is inside y, part is outside y; part of y is inside z, part is outside z)

Now let's think about how z could be related to x:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
This is possible. Part of z is inside y, which means it's inside x. And part of z is outside y, which could be outside x. In this scenario, part of z is inside x, and part is outside x, which fits the definition of PO.

2. TPP(z,x) / TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
This is possible. If all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x, then we have TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

3. NTPP(z,x) / NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
This is possible. If all of z is inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then we have NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

4. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
This is possible. If z extends to exactly match x, then x and z are equal.

5. TPP(x,z) / TPPi(z,x): x is a tangential proper part of z
This is possible. If z extends beyond x, and x touches the boundary of z, then we have TPP(x,z) or equivalently TPPi(z,x).

6. NTPP(x,z) / NTPPi(z,x): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
This is not immediately clear if this is possible. If z extends beyond x, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then we would have NTPP(x,z) or equivalently NTPPi(z,x). But we also know that y touches the boundary of x. So for this to be true, y would have to touch a part of x's boundary that's not also a part of z's boundary. I need to think more carefully about this.

7. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
This is not possible. Since part of z is inside y, and y is inside x, z and x must share some part.

8. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected
This is not possible. Since part of z is inside y, and y is inside x, z and x must share some interior, not just a boundary.

Let me reconsider case 6: NTPP(x,z) / NTPPi(z,x).

For NTPP(x,z), x must be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. We know y is a tangential proper part of x, so y touches x's boundary. For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, all of x, including its boundary, must be inside z's interior. This means y would also be completely inside z's interior. But we're told PO(y,z), which means part of y is outside z, contradicting the NTPP(x,z) relationship.

So NTPP(x,z) / NTPPi(z,x) is not possible.

Actually, let me think about case 5 again as well: TPP(x,z) / TPPi(z,x).

For TPP(x,z), x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. We know y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is inside x and touches x's boundary. Now, for TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x, including y, must be inside z. But we're told PO(y,z), which means part of y is outside z, contradicting the TPP(x,z) relationship.

So TPP(x,z) / TPPi(z,x) is not possible.

Let me rethink all the cases:

1. PO(x,z): This is possible. Part of z is inside y, which is inside x. And part of z is outside y, which could be outside x. This would make part of z inside x and part outside, which is the definition of PO.

2. TPP(z,x) / TPPi(x,z): This is possible. If all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x, then we have TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

3. NTPP(z,x) / NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. If all of z is inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then we have NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

4. EQ(x,z): This is possible. If z extends to exactly match x, then x and z are equal.

5. TPP(x,z) / TPPi(z,x): Let's rethink this. For TPP(x,z), all of x must be inside z, and x must touch z's boundary. We know y is a tangential proper part of x. For PO(y,z), part of y must be inside z and part must be outside z. If part of y is outside z, and y is inside x, then part of x must be outside z, which contradicts the TPP(x,z) relationship. So TPP(x,z) / TPPi(z,x) is not possible.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let me draw out the cases clearly:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, which means part of y is inside z, part is outside z, and similarly for z.

Now, since y is inside x, the part of y that overlaps with z is also inside x. But the part of z that's outside y could either be inside x or outside x. This gives us the following cases:

1. If the part of z that's outside y is also outside x, then z partially overlaps with x, so PO(x,z).

2. If the part of z that's outside y is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

3. If the part of z that's outside y is inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

4. If z coincides exactly with x, then EQ(x,z).

5. If z extends beyond x, then part of x is inside z (via y) and part of x is outside z (since y is a tangential proper part of x, it touches x's boundary, and if that part of the boundary is outside z, then part of x is outside z). This would mean PO(x,z), which we've already covered in case 1.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I think there's a confusion in my reasoning. Let me clarify:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

I need to be more precise about what "touches the boundary" means. In the context of RCC-8, "touches the boundary" means that the boundaries of the two regions have a non-empty intersection. It doesn't necessarily mean that one region "pokes" the other.

Given that, let's reconsider:

1. Since TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and the boundaries of x and y have a non-empty intersection.
2. Since PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap. Part of z is inside y, part is outside y. Similarly, part of y is inside z, part is outside z.

Now, the part of z that's inside y is also inside x (since y is inside x). The part of z that's outside y could be:
- Inside x, which would mean TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x), or EQ(x,z), depending on how z relates to the boundary of x.
- Partially inside and partially outside x, which would mean PO(x,z).
- Completely outside x, which would mean EC(z,x) or DC(z,x), but this contradicts the fact that part of z is inside y, and hence inside x.

The last option to consider is if z extends beyond x. In this case, we need to think about how x relates to z. If part of x is inside z (via y) and part is outside z, then we have PO(x,z). If all of x is inside z, then we have either TPP(x,z) (if x touches z's boundary) or NTPP(x,z) (if x doesn't touch z's boundary).

However, for TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x must be inside z. We know y is inside x and touches x's boundary. We also know that part of y is outside z (from PO(y,z)). So, if part of y is outside z, and y is inside x, then part of x must be outside z, which contradicts the TPP(x,z) relationship. Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), all of x must be inside z and not touch z's boundary, which is also contradicted by the given conditions.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x) / TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x) / NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let's be even more careful. We're operating with binary relations in the RCC-8 calculus. I was thinking about the relationships wrong; in particular I need to be clearer about the implications of PO(y,z).

Let me restate the properties of the RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They don't share any points.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. They only touch at their boundaries, not in their interiors.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. All of x is inside y, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. All of x is inside y, and the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This is just TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is just NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. All of y is inside x, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Now, let's think about how z could be related to x.

Since y is inside x and z overlaps with y, z must also share some points with x. This rules out DC(x,z).

If z and x only touch at their boundaries and don't share any interior, it would mean EC(x,z). But since part of z is inside y, and y is inside x, z must share some interior with x. So EC(x,z) is ruled out.

Now, if all of z is inside x, it would be either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x), depending on whether z touches the boundary of x or not. This is possible.

If z and x share the same territory, it would be EQ(x,z). This is also possible.

If all of x is inside z, it would be either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z), depending on whether x touches the boundary of z or not. 

For TPP(x,z), all of x must be inside z, and x must touch the boundary of z. We know y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y touches the boundary of x. From PO(y,z), we know part of y is outside z. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's outside z, then part of x is outside z, contradicting TPP(x,z). However, it's possible that y touches the boundary of x at a point that's also on the boundary of z. In this case, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), all of x must be inside z, and x must not touch the boundary of z. We know y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y touches the boundary of x. If y touches the boundary of x, and all of x is inside z (and not touching the boundary of z), then the boundary of y must not touch the boundary of z. But from PO(y,z), we know y and z partially overlap, with part of y inside z and part outside. If part of y is outside z, and y touches the boundary of x, then either part of x is outside z (contradicting NTPP(x,z)) or y touches the boundary of x at a point that's also on the boundary of z (contradicting NTPP(x,z)). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, wait. Actually, I think I'm still not fully grasping all the subtle implications. Let me think about this in a very concrete way, using a more set-theoretic approach.

Let's think of regions as sets of points. The different RCC-8 relations can then be thought of in the following way:

- DC(x,y): x and y are completely disjoint sets.
- EC(x,y): x and y have no common interior points, but they have common boundary points.
- PO(x,y): x and y have common interior points, but x is not a subset of y, and y is not a subset of x.
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y (x is fully contained in y, but x ≠ y), and there's at least one point on the boundary of x that's also on the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y, and there's no point on the boundary of x that's also on the boundary of y (all boundary points of x are interior points of y).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and there's at least one point on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and there's no point on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same set.

Given TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a proper subset of x, and there's at least one point on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of x.

Given PO(y,z), we know that y and z have some common interior points, but y is not a subset of z, and z is not a subset of y.

Now, let's think about how z could be related to x. If I denote interior, boundary, and exterior using Int(X), Bound(X), and Ext(X):

- We know Int(y) ∩ Int(z) ≠ ∅ (from PO(y,z)). We also know Int(y) ⊂ Int(x) (from TPPi(x,y)). So, Int(z) ∩ Int(x) ≠ ∅. This means z and x have some common interior points, ruling out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

- From PO(y,z), we know part of y is outside z, meaning Int(y) ∩ Ext(z) ≠ ∅. Also, part of z is outside y, meaning Int(z) ∩ Ext(y) ≠ ∅.

- Since Int(y) ⊂ Int(x), if Int(y) ∩ Ext(z) ≠ ∅, then Int(x) ∩ Ext(z) ≠ ∅. This means part of the interior of x is outside z.

- Already, we can rule out TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), because for these relationships, x would have to be completely inside z, but we just showed part of the interior of x is outside z.

Now, we still need to consider PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x), and EQ(x,z).

- For PO(x,z), part of the interior of x should be inside z, and part should be outside z. Also, part of the interior of z should be inside x, and part should be outside x. We already established Int(x) ∩ Int(z) ≠ ∅ (they share interior points) and Int(x) ∩ Ext(z) ≠ ∅ (part of the interior of x is outside z). We still need to determine if part of the interior of z is outside x.

  If all of z is inside x, then TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x), or EQ(x,z) would hold, not PO(x,z). If z extends beyond x, then Int(z) ∩ Ext(x) ≠ ∅, which would make PO(x,z) true.

  So, PO(x,z) is possible.

- For TPP(z,x), all of z must be inside x, and the boundary of z must touch the boundary of x. Given PO(y,z), part of z is outside y. This part can still be inside x, making TPP(z,x) possible.

- For NTPP(z,x), all of z must be inside x, and the boundary of z must not touch the boundary of x. Given PO(y,z), part of z is outside y but inside x, which is possible. So NTPP(z,x) is possible.

- For EQ(x,z), x and z must coincide. Given TPPi(x,y), y is a proper subset of x. Given PO(y,z), part of y is outside z, and part of z is outside y. If x and z are to be equal, part of y must be outside z, and part of z must be outside y, which are true from PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Upon careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

So my final answer is:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other)

To determine the possible relationships between x and z:

Since y is inside x and z partially overlaps with y, we know:
- z must share some interior points with x (via y)
- Part of y is outside z (from PO relationship)
- Since y is inside x, the part of y outside z is still inside x

Let's analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible, as z shares interior points with x via y.
2. EC(x,z): Impossible for the same reason.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. z shares interior with x (via y), and z can extend outside x.
4. TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z): Possible. All of z could be inside x while touching x's boundary.
5. NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z): Possible. All of z could be inside x without touching x's boundary.
6. TPP(x,z) or TPPi(z,x): Impossible. This would require all of x to be inside z, but we know part of y (which is inside x) is outside z.
7. NTPP(x,z) or NTPPi(z,x): Impossible for the same reason as #6.
8. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z could be identical.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
