PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the relations we're given:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some part, but x extends beyond y in some regions, and y extends beyond x in other regions.

Given that NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely contained within z, without touching z's boundary.

Let's analyze the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is not possible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, x must have some overlap with z as well.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is possible if the part of x that extends beyond y touches the boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is possible if x extends both inside and outside of z. The part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z, but other parts of x could be outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This is possible if all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This is possible if all of x is completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z): These would mean that z is a part of x. Since we know that y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, z cannot be a part of x. So these are not possible.

7. EQ(x,z) - equal: This would mean that x and z are the same region. Since y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, x and z cannot be the same. So this is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Wait, I need to think more carefully about EC(x,z). For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. But we know that x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z without touching its boundary. This means that part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y), so x and z share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me carefully reconsider my analysis.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some parts, but each also has parts not in the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

From these, we can infer:
- Since y is completely inside z, the parts of x that overlap with y are also inside z.
- The parts of x that are not in y could be inside z or outside z or both.

Let's analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: For this to be true, x and z would need to have no common parts. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, x and z must share at least some parts. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: For this to be true, x and z would need to touch at a boundary but have no common interior parts. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, x and z must share some interior parts. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: For this to be true, x and z would need to share some parts, but each would also have parts not in the other. Since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, x and z definitely share some parts. If x has parts outside of z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: For this to be true, all of x would need to be inside z, and x would need to touch z's boundary. Since the parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, this is possible if the rest of x is also inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: For this to be true, all of x would need to be inside z, not touching z's boundary. Since the parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, this is possible if the rest of x is also inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: For this to be true, z would need to be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. But since y is a proper part of z, and y already shares parts with x, z cannot be a proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: For this to be true, z would need to be a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. But as with TPPi, since y is a proper part of z, and y already shares parts with x, z cannot be a proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: For this to be true, x and z would need to be the same region. But since y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let's double check these possibilities with concrete examples:

1. PO(x,z): Let's imagine y as a small circle, z as a larger circle that completely contains y (with space between y and z's boundary), and x as a circle that partially overlaps with y and extends outside of z. In this case, x and z share some parts (the overlap of x and y), but each also has parts not in the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): Let's imagine y as a small circle, z as a larger circle that completely contains y (with space between y and z's boundary), and x as a circle that partially overlaps with y and extends to touch z's boundary, but doesn't go outside of z. In this case, all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): Let's imagine y as a small circle, z as a larger circle that completely contains y (with space between y and z's boundary), and x as a circle that partially overlaps with y and is completely inside z, without touching z's boundary. In this case, all of x is inside z, not touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This confirms my previous analysis.

Hmm, actually, I'm not sure if the TPP(x,z) case as I've described it satisfies PO(x,y). Let me revisit the definitions to make sure.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

In my example for TPP(x,z), I described x as a circle that partially overlaps with y. So x and y share a spatial part. And since x extends beyond y, y is not a part of x. And since x doesn't contain all of y, x is not a part of y either. So this does satisfy PO(x,y).

So the possible relationships between x and z are indeed:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, looking over my concrete examples, there's something I didn't quite right. Let me redescribe the scenarios more carefully.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some parts, but each also has parts not in the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

1. PO(x,z) example:
   - y is a small circle
   - z is a larger circle that completely contains y (with space between y and z's boundary)
   - x is a shape that partially overlaps with y and extends outside of z
   In this case, x and z share some parts (the overlap of x and y), but each also has parts not in the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z) example:
   - y is a small circle
   - z is a larger circle that completely contains y (with space between y and z's boundary)
   - x is a shape that partially overlaps with y and extends to touch z's boundary, but doesn't go outside of z
   In this case, all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z) example:
   - y is a small circle
   - z is a larger circle that completely contains y (with space between y and z's boundary)
   - x is a shape that partially overlaps with y and is completely inside z, without touching z's boundary
   In this case, all of x is inside z, not touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

I believe this analysis is correct, and the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me verify these with another approach. Let's think about the composition of PO and NTPP. The composition of two relations R1(x,y) and R2(y,z) is the set of all possible relations R3(x,z) that can hold.

In this case, we want to find the composition of PO and NTPP.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z and see if it's compatible with PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: If x and z are disconnected, then x and y cannot overlap, because y is completely inside z. This contradicts PO(x,y), so DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: If x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts, then x and y cannot overlap, because y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This contradicts PO(x,y), so EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: If x and z share some parts but each also has parts not in the other, this is compatible with PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). The parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, and x can also have parts outside of z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: If all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary, this is compatible with PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). The parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, and the rest of x can also be inside z and touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary, this is compatible with PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). The parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, and the rest of x can also be inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: If z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, this contradicts NTPP(y,z). Since y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, if z is a proper part of x, then y is even more inside x and definitely doesn't touch x's boundary. This contradicts PO(x,y), which says that neither x nor y is a part of the other. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: If z is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary, this contradicts NTPP(y,z) for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: If x and z are the same region, then since y is a proper part of z, y is also a proper part of x. This contradicts PO(x,y), which says that neither x nor y is a part of the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's reason about this a bit more. Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some parts, but each also has parts not in the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

So there's a part of x (call it A) that's also a part of y. Since y is completely inside z, A is also inside z.

There's also a part of x (call it B) that's not a part of y. B could be inside z or outside z or both. 

If B is completely inside z, then all of x is inside z. Depending on whether x touches z's boundary, we have either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

If B has some parts outside of z, then x has parts both inside and outside of z, so PO(x,z).

So indeed, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I'll analyze what we know about the relationships between x, y, and z:

1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap - they share some spatial part, but neither is contained within the other.

2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z - y is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to consider what these conditions tell us:
- Part of x overlaps with y
- This overlapping part must be inside z (since y is inside z)
- The part of x that doesn't overlap with y could be inside z, outside z, or cross z's boundary

Looking at the possible RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,z): Not possible because x must share at least the part that overlaps with y with z.
- EC(x,z): Not possible because x and z must share interior points (the part of x that overlaps with y).
- PO(x,z): Possible if part of x extends outside of z.
- TPP(x,z): Possible if all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): Possible if all of x is inside z without touching z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z cannot be part of x (since y is properly inside z and x only partially overlaps with y).
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because x partially overlaps with y, which is properly inside z.
