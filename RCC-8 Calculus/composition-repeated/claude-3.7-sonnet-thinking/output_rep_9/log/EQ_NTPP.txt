PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what we know:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same spatial region.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Given that x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), they occupy the same spatial region. This means that whatever spatial relationship y has with other regions, x will have the same relationship.

So if NTPP(y,z), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

To double-check this, let's reason through the definitions:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region
- NTPP(y,z) means y is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary
- Given that x is the same region as y, x must also be strictly inside z without touching z's boundary
- Therefore, NTPP(x,z)

I can't see any other possible relationship between x and z given the constraints. The answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's analyze:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

Since x and y are coincident (exactly the same region), and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, x must have the same relationship with z as y does with z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
