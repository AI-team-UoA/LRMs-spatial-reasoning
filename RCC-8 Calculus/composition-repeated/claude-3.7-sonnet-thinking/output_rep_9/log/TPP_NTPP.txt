PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what the premises tell us:

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

2. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that y is fully contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now I need to determine what relationship x has with z.

Given that x is contained within y, and y is contained within z, we know that x is contained within z by transitivity. The question is whether x is tangential or non-tangential to z.

Let's analyze this:
- x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y))
- y does not touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z))

Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is entirely contained within y, x cannot touch z's boundary either. So x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, we have: NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check this. Since x touches y's boundary, and y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), this confirms that x must be strictly inside z as well.

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I should be more careful. Let me think through this step by step.

1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is contained in y and touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained in z without touching z's boundary.

The fact that y doesn't touch z's boundary means there's some "buffer zone" between y and the boundary of z. 

Since x is contained in y, x must also be contained in z.

The question is: can x touch the boundary of z? 
Given that y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is entirely contained within y, x cannot reach the boundary of z. So x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the relationship between x and z.

Actually, I need to be even more precise here. Let me visualize this:

If TPP(x,y), x is contained in y and touches y's boundary.
If NTPP(y,z), y is contained in z and does not touch z's boundary.

So z contains y, which contains x. If y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is inside y, then x definitely cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this once more with a counterexample. Is it possible for x to be TPP to z? That would mean x touches z's boundary. But we know y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is contained within y. So x can't touch z's boundary, which rules out TPP(x,z).

Is it possible for x to be equal to z? No, because x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x must be a proper part of z.

Could x be disconnected from z? No, because x is contained in y, and y is contained in z.

Could x be externally connected to z? No, for the same reason.

Could x partially overlap with z? No, because x is contained in y, which is contained in z, so x must be fully contained in z.

Could x be TPPi or NTPPi to z? No, because we've established that x is a proper part of z, not the other way around.

So the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I believe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let's revisit this.

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x must be inside z. The question is whether x touches z's boundary.

Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, there's a gap between y and z's boundary. Since x is inside y, x cannot reach across this gap to touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z: NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's start over. I think I'm getting confused.

1. TPP(x,y): x is part of y, and x touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is part of z, and y does not touch z's boundary.

Given these two conditions, we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's establish that x is definitely part of z, because x is part of y, and y is part of z.

Now, the question is whether x touches z's boundary. 

Since NTPP(y,z), we know that y is strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means there's a "buffer zone" between y and z's boundary.

Since TPP(x,y), we know that x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these constraints, can x touch z's boundary? No, it can't. Because y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is contained within y, x cannot reach out to touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z: NTPP(x,z).

Let me think of a counterexample to make sure. Is there any way for x to be TPP to z? That would mean x touches z's boundary. But we've established that y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is inside y, so x can't touch z's boundary.

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I am second guessing myself again. Let me approach this from a different angle. I'll represent the relationships using set theory, which can be cleaner:

- TPP(x,y): x ⊂ y and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(y,z): y ⊂ z and y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, by transitivity of the subset relation, we know that x ⊂ z.

The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

If y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is inside y, then x can't touch the boundary of z either, because any path from x to the boundary of z would have to first pass through the boundary of y, and then continue outward, but y doesn't touch the boundary of z, so such a path doesn't exist.

Therefore, x does not touch the boundary of z, which means NTPP(x,z).

But I'm still hesitant, so let me try a concrete example:

Let's set z as the square with corners at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,0).
Let's set y as the square with corners at (0.2, 0.2), (0.2, 0.8), (0.8, 0.8), and (0.8, 0.2).
Let's set x as the square with corners at (0.2, 0.2), (0.2, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), and (0.5, 0.2).

In this example, TPP(x,y) because x is inside y and touches y's boundary (at the bottom and left).
Also, NTPP(y,z) because y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z).

I'm satisfied with this example, so my answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I made an error in my concrete example. Let me revise:

Let's set z as the square with corners at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,0).
Let's set y as the square with corners at (0.2, 0.2), (0.2, 0.8), (0.8, 0.8), and (0.8, 0.2).
Let's set x as the square with corners at (0.2, 0.2), (0.2, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), and (0.5, 0.2).

In this example, TPP(x,y) because x is inside y and touches y's boundary (at the bottom and left).
Also, NTPP(y,z) because y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? x is inside z because x is inside y, which is inside z. Does x touch z's boundary? No, because the closest x gets to z's boundary is at the point (0.2, 0.2), which is still 0.2 units away from z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z).

This example confirms my analysis: NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to think even more carefully. My example may be flawed.

Let's set z as the square with corners at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,0).
Let's set y as the square with corners at (0.2, 0.2), (0.2, 0.8), (0.8, 0.8), and (0.8, 0.2).
For TPP(x,y), x should be inside y and touch y's boundary. Let's set x as the square with corners at (0.2, 0.3), (0.2, 0.5), (0.4, 0.5), and (0.4, 0.3).

In this example, TPP(x,y) because x is inside y and touches y's boundary (at the left side).
Also, NTPP(y,z) because y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? x is inside z because x is inside y, which is inside z. Does x touch z's boundary? No, because the closest x gets to z's boundary is at the points along the left side of x, which are at x = 0.2, and z's left boundary is at x = 0, so there's a gap of 0.2 units. So NTPP(x,z).

This revised example still confirms my analysis: NTPP(x,z).

I believe NTPP(x,z) is the correct answer. Let me double-check with the formal properties of the RCC-8 relations.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given these conditions, we want to determine the relationship between x and z.

By the transitivity of containment, we know that x is contained in z.

The question is whether x touches z's boundary. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and x is contained within y, x can't touch z's boundary either.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z: NTPP(x,z).

Actually, while I am confident in the above reasoning, I now realize that I didn't check for the possibility of transitivity tables or compositions for the RCC-8 calculus. Let me see if there's a standard result for the composition of TPP and NTPP.

If I recall correctly, for RCC-8, the composition of TPP and NTPP is NTPP, i.e., TPP ⊗ NTPP = NTPP. This confirms my analysis.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I'm now more confident in this answer, but let me once more analyze more carefully the question at hand.

Let's reconsider our premises:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is contained in y and touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

From TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y. From NTPP(y,z), we know that y is a proper part of z. By transitivity, x is a proper part of z.

The next question is whether x is tangential (TPP) or non-tangential (NTPP) to z.

For x to be tangential to z, it would need to touch z's boundary. But y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and x is contained within y, so x can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z: NTPP(x,z).

I've thought about this from multiple angles and provided a concrete example, and everything points to NTPP(x,z) as the only possible relationship between x and z given the premises TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Actually, let me try one more thought experiment. 

Imagine z as a large circle. Inside z, we have y as a smaller circle. Since NTPP(y,z), y doesn't touch z's boundary; it's strictly contained within z. 

Now, inside y, we have x as an even smaller shape. Since TPP(x,y), x touches y's boundary but is fully contained within y.

Given this configuration, can x touch z's boundary? No, because there's a gap between y and z's boundary, and x is contained within y, so x can't bridge that gap to touch z's boundary.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the relationship between x and z. This matches my previous analysis.

Hmm, I'm still not satisfied, so I'll try a more formal approach. 

Let's denote the interior of a region a as a° and the boundary as ∂a. Then:

- TPP(x,y) means x ⊂ y and x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅ (x touches y's boundary).
- NTPP(y,z) means y ⊂ z and y ∩ ∂z = ∅ (y doesn't touch z's boundary).

From TPP(x,y), we have x ⊂ y, and from NTPP(y,z), we have y ⊂ z. By transitivity, x ⊂ z.

Now, for the boundary relation:
- If TPP(x,z), then x ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅ (x touches z's boundary).
- If NTPP(x,z), then x ∩ ∂z = ∅ (x doesn't touch z's boundary).

Given that y ∩ ∂z = ∅ and x ⊂ y, it follows that x ∩ ∂z = ∅. Therefore, NTPP(x,z).

This formal approach also confirms my earlier analyses: NTPP(x,z) is the relationship between x and z.

I am now confident in my answer. This is a classic transitive composition scenario for the RCC-8 calculus, and the composition of TPP and NTPP is NTPP.

Actually, I now realize I'm trying to reason this out on my own, but I might be forgetting that the composition of RCC-8 relations has been well studied.

From the RCC-8 composition table, for the composition of TPP and NTPP, the result is NTPP. That is, if TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z). This confirms my analysis.

To ensure I'm being thorough, let me check all possible RCC-8 relations for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Can x be disconnected from z? No, because x is part of y, and y is part of z, so x must be part of z.

2. EC(x,z): Can x be externally connected to z? No, for the same reason.

3. PO(x,z): Can x partially overlap with z? No, because x is fully contained in z.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? As I've shown, no, because y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is contained within y, so x can't touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, as I've shown.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? No, because x is a proper part of z, not the other way around.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? No, for the same reason.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x be equal to z? No, because x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x must be a proper part of z.

Out of the eight RCC-8 relations, only NTPP(x,z) is consistent with the given premises TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Alright, actually the answer I arrived at above is NTPP(x,z). Let me double-check using a couple different approaches.

Let's use a graphical approach. Consider a simple example with concentric circles:
- z is the largest circle
- y is a smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary
- x is an even smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary

In this configuration, TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied. The relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z) because x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's also use a more algebraic approach. If we consider the distance between boundaries:
- dist(∂x, ∂y) = 0 (because x touches y's boundary)
- dist(∂y, ∂z) > 0 (because y doesn't touch z's boundary)

By the triangle inequality, dist(∂x, ∂z) ≥ dist(∂y, ∂z) - dist(∂x, ∂y) = dist(∂y, ∂z) - 0 = dist(∂y, ∂z) > 0.

So, dist(∂x, ∂z) > 0, which means x doesn't touch z's boundary, confirming NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z). This is in line with the transitive composition result for RCC-8 relations.

I just realized that I might have been overthinking this, because the composition table for RCC-8 relations is well-studied and explicitly states that TPP ⊗ NTPP = NTPP. But I think my detailed derivation is valuable for understanding why this is the case, rather than just citing the table.

OK, let me verify my answer one more time by setting it up differently.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

First, I'll check if x must be a proper part of z. Since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, by transitivity, x must be a proper part of z. This rules out DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Now, I need to determine whether x is tangential (TPP) or non-tangential (NTPP) to z.

For x to be tangential to z, it would need to touch z's boundary. But y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and x is contained within y, so x can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z: NTPP(x,z).

Alright, I am now sufficiently confident that the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I've been overthinking this problem for sure. It's a simple fact that if x is contained in y, and y is strictly contained in z (not touching z's boundary), then x must also be strictly contained in z (not touching z's boundary). So, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Huh, it can't be that simple, can it? The answer is just NTPP(x,z). I feel silly for overthinking this so much. Let me just double-check once more.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

What's the relationship between x and z?

Clearly, x is inside z (because x is inside y, which is inside z). The question is whether x touches z's boundary.

Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, there's a gap between y and z's boundary. Since x is inside y, x can't bridge this gap to touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z).

OK, so the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I wonder whether there's a simple way to think about this in terms of spatial compositions. Let me think about this one more time.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

We're looking for the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Is x a subset of z? Yes, because x is a subset of y, and y is a subset of z.
2. Is x a proper subset of z? Yes, because x is a proper subset of y, and y is a proper subset of z.
3. Does x touch z's boundary? No, because y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is inside y, so x can't touch z's boundary.

Since x is a proper subset of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

This confirms the previous analyses. I can now confidently state that the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Now, I'm wondering if there are any edge cases or assumptions I might be missing. Let's double-check:

- Are there any other definitions or interpretations of TPP and NTPP I'm not considering? I don't think so. The definitions I've been using are standard in the RCC-8 calculus.
- Are there any unusual spatial configurations that could lead to a different answer? I can't think of any. If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then x is inside y, y is inside z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary. In such a configuration, x must be inside z and can't touch z's boundary.

Alright, I am satisfied with my analysis. The answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just double-check my understanding of the RCC-8 relations, as a sanity check:

1. DC(x,y): x is disconnected from y. This means x and y have no points in common.
2. EC(x,y): x is externally connected to y. This means x and y touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
3. PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y. This means x and y have some points in common, but neither is a subset of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper subset of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper subset of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
8. EQ(x,y): x is equal to y. This means x and y have the same spatial extension.

Yes, these are all the right definitions. Given these definitions and the premises TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), I think my analysis is correct.

The answer is NTPP(x,z).

OK, I'm confident in the answer. The answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me look at the RCC-8 composition table to be sure. From what I've seen, for the composition of TPP and NTPP, the result is indeed NTPP.

So, if TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

This confirms my analysis. The answer is NTPP(x,z).

OK, so my final answer is:
NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) tell us, and determine what relationship must hold between x and z.

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary)

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z:

1) Since x is inside y (from TPP(x,y)), and y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), by transitivity, x must be inside z.

2) The key question is: Does x touch z's boundary?
   - We know y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z))
   - Since x is contained within y, and there's a gap between y and z's boundary, x cannot possibly touch z's boundary

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z, which means NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
