PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationship between x and z given the information EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Let's first recall what EQ means: EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

So we have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident

Now, if x and y are coincident, and y and z are coincident, then by transitivity, x and z must also be coincident. 

So the relationship between x and z would be EQ(x,z).

Let me double-check this. 

The definition of EQ(x,y) is that x and y occupy exactly the same space. If x and y occupy the same space, and y and z occupy the same space, then x and z must occupy the same space. So EQ(x,z) is indeed the only possible relationship.

To put it another way, the EQ relation is transitive, meaning that if EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

The EQ relation is transitive. If x is equal to y, and y is equal to z, then x must be equal to z.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
