PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me reason through this problem.

First, let's understand what we're given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think about this systematically:

Given that z is a proper part of y (and touches y's boundary), and x partially overlaps with y, there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC): This is possible if x overlaps with a part of y that is separate from z.

2. x and z could be externally connected (EC): This could happen if x touches z at the boundary, but doesn't share any interior with z.

3. x and z could partially overlap (PO): This would happen if x shares some interior with z, but neither is a proper part of the other.

4. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPP): This means z is completely within x and touches x's boundary.

5. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP): This means z is completely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

6. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPPi): This means x is completely within z and touches z's boundary.

7. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPPi): This means x is completely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

8. x and z could be equal (EQ): This means x and z are the same region.

Let's analyze each of these possibilities to see which ones are consistent with our given information:

For DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then x overlaps with some part of y that doesn't include z. This is consistent with our given information.

For EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected, then x touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior with z. This is also consistent with our given information.

For PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then they share some interior, but neither is a proper part of the other. This is consistent with our given information.

For TPP(z,x): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely within x and touches x's boundary. Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's not immediately clear if this is possible. Let me think more.

Actually, I think TPP(z,x) is not possible. Since TPP(z,y), z is a proper part of y. And since PO(x,y), x is not a proper part of y (and y is not a proper part of x). So if z were a proper part of x, then z would be a proper part of x, and x would not be a proper part of y. This means x has parts outside of y. But since z is a proper part of y, z cannot be a proper part of parts of x that are outside of y. So, I don't think TPP(z,x) is possible.

Wait, I made a mistake. TPP(z,x) is possible. If z is in the overlap region of x and y, and z touches the boundary of x, then z can be a tangential proper part of x.

For NTPP(z,x): Similarly, if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is in the overlap region of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

For TPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, which would imply that x is completely within z. But since PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y), x has parts outside of z (those parts of x that are outside of y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which would also imply that x is completely within z. This is not possible for the same reason as above.

For EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y), x has parts outside of y, while z is completely within y. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider and make sure I'm correct. 

For TPP(z,x): We have TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. And we have PO(x,y), which means x and y share a part, but neither is a proper part of the other. For TPP(z,x) to be true, z needs to be completely within x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, z could be in the overlap region of x and y, touching the boundary of x. So, TPP(z,x) is possible.

For NTPP(z,x): Similar to TPP(z,x), but z doesn't touch the boundary of x. If z is in the overlap region of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, x needs to be completely within z and touch z's boundary. Since PO(x,y), x has parts outside of y. And since TPP(z,y), z is completely within y. So, x has parts outside of z, which means x cannot be a proper part of z. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similar reasoning as TPPi(x,z). X has parts outside of z, so x cannot be a proper part of z.

For EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. Since TPP(z,y), z is a proper part of y. But since PO(x,y), x is not a proper part of y. Thus, x and z cannot be the same region, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Given my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me re-analyze this systematically. It's possible that I made a mistake.

We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's think about the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? 
   Since z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, x could overlap with a part of y that doesn't include z. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be externally connected? 
   Since z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, x could touch z at its boundary without sharing any interior. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? 
   Since z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, x could share some interior with z while also having parts outside of z. And z could have parts that don't overlap with x. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x? 
   This means z is completely within x and touches x's boundary. Since z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, z could be in the overlap region of x and y, touching the boundary of x. So, TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x? 
   This means z is completely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is in the overlap region of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z? 
   This means x is completely within z and touches z's boundary. Since PO(x,y), x has parts outside of y. And since TPP(z,y), z is completely within y. So, x has parts outside of z, which means x cannot be a proper part of z. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z? 
   Similar reasoning as TPPi(x,z). X has parts outside of z, so x cannot be a proper part of z. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be equal? 
   Since TPP(z,y), z is a proper part of y. But since PO(x,y), x is not a proper part of y. Thus, x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me double-check again by reasoning through the whole problem:

1. We know PO(x,y) - meaning that x and y partially overlap (share parts) but neither is contained within the other.
2. We know TPPi(y,z) - which is the same as TPP(z,y) - meaning z is a tangential proper part of y.

So visually, y contains z completely (since z is a proper part of y), and z touches the boundary of y (since it's a tangential proper part).

And x overlaps partially with y, meaning some of x is inside y and some is outside.

Now, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, there are several possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This can happen if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't overlap with z. Yes, this is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at the boundary). This can happen if the part of x that overlaps with y touches z at its boundary. Yes, this is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This can happen if the part of x that overlaps with y also partially overlaps with z. Yes, this is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z is a proper part of y and x partially overlaps with y, this is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z and z touches the boundary of x. Yes, this is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to the reasoning for TPP(z,x), this is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Yes, this is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But we know that x partially overlaps with y, which means x has parts outside of y. And since z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar reasoning as TPPi(x,z). X has parts outside of y, so x cannot be completely inside z. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. Since PO(x,y), x has parts outside of y. And since TPP(z,y), z is completely inside y. So, x and z cannot be equal. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me check the TPP case again.

TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

We know that z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), so z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

We also know that x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), so x has parts inside y and parts outside y.

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x. Given that z is completely inside y, z must be in the overlap region of x and y.

Also, z must touch the boundary of x. Since z is a tangential proper part of y, z touches the boundary of y. If x's boundary passes through the point where z touches y's boundary, then z would also touch the boundary of x. But it's also possible that z touches a different part of x's boundary, not where z touches y's boundary.

So, TPP(z,x) is indeed possible.

Let me also check the NTPP case.

NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

We know that z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), so z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

We also know that x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), so x has parts inside y and parts outside y.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x. Given that z is completely inside y, z must be in the overlap region of x and y.

Also, z must not touch the boundary of x. Since z touches the boundary of y, and the boundaries of x and y can intersect, it's possible for z to touch the boundary of y but not the boundary of x. 

Actually, I need to be more careful here. If z touches the boundary of y, and z is completely inside x, then x must extend beyond the boundary of y at the point where z touches y's boundary. In that case, z would not touch the boundary of x. So, NTPP(z,x) is indeed possible.

Let me reassess once more to be sure:

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z must not share any part. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't overlap with z.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at a boundary but not share any interior. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y touches z at its boundary.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some interior, but neither should be a part of the other. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y partially overlaps with z.

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But since x has parts outside of y (due to PO(x,y)), and z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. Similar reasoning as TPPi(x,z). X has parts outside of y, so x cannot be completely inside z. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be the same region. Since x has parts outside of y and z is completely inside y, x and z cannot be the same region. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I realized I still need to be more careful with the NTPP(z,x) case. 

NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

We know that z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), so z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must not touch the boundary of x. But since z touches the boundary of y, if the boundaries of x and y coincide at the point where z touches y's boundary, then z would also touch the boundary of x. So, for NTPP(z,x) to be true, the boundaries of x and y must not coincide at the point where z touches y's boundary.

Given that x partially overlaps with y, the boundaries of x and y can intersect, but they don't have to coincide at all points. So, it's possible for z to touch the boundary of y but not the boundary of x, making NTPP(z,x) a possibility.

To be even more careful, let's consider a specific scenario:

Imagine y as a circle, and z as a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at one point. Now, consider x as another circle that partially overlaps with y. There are several configurations possible:

1. x and z don't overlap at all, giving DC(x,z).
2. x and z touch at one point, giving EC(x,z).
3. x and z overlap partially, giving PO(x,z).
4. z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, giving TPP(z,x).
5. z is completely inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary, giving NTPP(z,x).

All of these are consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me make one final examination of all these cases to triple-check:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, sharing no points.
   Given TPP(z,y), z is completely inside y.
   Given PO(x,y), x has parts inside y and parts outside.
   x can be positioned so that its parts inside y don't overlap with z, making DC(x,z) possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
   Given TPP(z,y), z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
   Given PO(x,y), x has parts inside y and parts outside.
   x can be positioned so that it touches z at its boundary but doesn't share any interior with z, making EC(x,z) possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some interior points, but neither is part of the other.
   Given TPP(z,y), z is completely inside y.
   Given PO(x,y), x has parts inside y and parts outside.
   x can be positioned so that its parts inside y partially overlap with z, making PO(x,z) possible.

4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   Given TPP(z,y), z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
   Given PO(x,y), x has parts inside y and parts outside.
   x can be positioned so that it completely contains z, and the point where z touches y's boundary is also a point on x's boundary, making TPP(z,x) possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   Given TPP(z,y), z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
   Given PO(x,y), x has parts inside y and parts outside.
   
   This is a case I need to check more carefully. Since z touches y's boundary, can it be completely inside x without touching x's boundary?

   Yes, it's possible. For example, imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary, and x as a shape that contains z and extends beyond y. If x's boundary doesn't coincide with y's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary, then z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is equivalent to TPP(x,z), meaning x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Given TPP(z,y), z is completely inside y.
   Given PO(x,y), x has parts inside y and parts outside.
   Since x has parts outside y, and z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(x,z), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar reasoning as TPPi(x,z). X has parts outside y, so x cannot be completely inside z. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal, meaning they are the same region.
   Since x has parts outside y and z is completely inside y, x and z cannot be the same region. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After careful analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I want to check NTPP(z,x) case one last time as this is the one I found most confusing.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and must not touch x's boundary.

We know TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
We also know PO(x,y), which means x and y share a part, but neither is a part of the other.

Let's consider a specific scenario: y is a square, z is a smaller square inside y, touching y's boundary at one side. Now, consider x as a shape that overlaps with y. For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and must not touch x's boundary.

Since z touches y's boundary, for z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, x must extend beyond y's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary. This is possible given PO(x,y), since x can have parts outside y.

So, I believe NTPP(z,x) is possible.

Wait, let me think about this more carefully.

TPP(z,y) means that z touches y's boundary.
For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must not touch x's boundary.

The question is: can z touch y's boundary but not touch x's boundary while being completely inside x?

If z touches y's boundary and is completely inside x, and if x's boundary coincides with y's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary. For z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, x's boundary must not coincide with y's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary.

Given PO(x,y), x can have parts outside y, which means there are points on y's boundary that are not on x's boundary. So, it's possible for z to touch y's boundary at a point that's not on x's boundary, making NTPP(z,x) a possibility.

So, after this final examination, I maintain that the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Wait, I realized I might have been too hasty in concluding NTPP(z,x) is possible. Let me really think this through.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and must not touch x's boundary.

We know TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

For z to be completely inside x, x must cover all of z. Since z touches y's boundary, x must extend to (or beyond) y's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary.

Now, if x's boundary coincides with y's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary, making TPP(z,x) true, not NTPP(z,x).

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, x's boundary must not coincide with y's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary. This means x must extend beyond y's boundary at this point.

Given PO(x,y), x can have parts outside y. But does this guarantee that x can extend beyond y's boundary at the specific point where z touches y's boundary?

Actually, the partial overlap condition (PO(x,y)) doesn't guarantee this. It just says that x and y share a part, but neither is a part of the other. It doesn't specify where the overlap happens or where x extends beyond y.

So, while PO(x,y) doesn't rule out the possibility of NTPP(z,x), it doesn't guarantee it either. We need to check if there's a specific constraint that might prevent NTPP(z,x).

Let me reconsider:

TPP(z,y) means z touches y's boundary.
For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must not touch x's boundary.

If z touches y's boundary and is completely inside x, for z to not touch x's boundary, x must extend beyond y's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary.

Given PO(x,y), x has parts inside y and parts outside. But PO(x,y) doesn't specify where x extends beyond y. It's possible for x to extend beyond y at the point where z touches y's boundary, making NTPP(z,x) a possibility.

Here's a concrete example: Consider y as a square, and z as a smaller square inside y, touching y's boundary at one side. Now, consider x as a larger square that contains z and extends beyond y on the side where z touches y's boundary. In this case, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, making NTPP(z,x) true.

I believe NTPP(z,x) is indeed possible.

So, after this careful examination, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I'm still not satisfied with my reasoning about NTPP(z,x). Let me try again:

We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and must not touch x's boundary.

Let me think more concretely. Imagine a concrete example:

Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 5. Note that z is inside y and touches y's boundary at the point (10,0).
Let x be a shape that partially overlaps with y. For NTPP(z,x) to be true, x must completely contain z and z must not touch x's boundary.

One way to achieve this is to make x a circle centered at the origin with radius 15. Then, x completely contains z, and the boundary of x is at a distance of 15 from the origin, which is 5 units away from the point where z touches y's boundary. So, z does not touch x's boundary, making NTPP(z,x) true.

But there's a problem. With this configuration, x completely contains y, which contradicts PO(x,y).

Let me try a different example.

Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 5. Note that z is inside y and touches y's boundary at the point (10,0).
Let x be a shape that partially overlaps with y.

One possible shape for x is a circle centered at the point (5,5) with radius 10. This circle overlaps with y, but neither is contained within the other, satisfying PO(x,y). The circle x also completely contains z, since the distance from the center of x to the center of z is 5, which is less than the radius of x.

Now, the boundary of x is at a distance of 10 from the point (5,5). The point where z touches y's boundary is (10,0). The distance from (5,5) to (10,0) is sqrt(5^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07, which is less than 10. So, the point (10,0) is not on the boundary of x, but is inside x. This means z doesn't touch the boundary of x, making NTPP(z,x) true.

So, it is indeed possible for NTPP(z,x) to be true given PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

I am now very confident that the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Wait, let me think about the EC(x,z) case again. This is where x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

For this to be true, z must touch the boundary of x. We know that z is completely inside y (since TPP(z,y)), and x has parts inside y and parts outside (since PO(x,y)).

One possible configuration is where x touches z at its boundary, but doesn't overlap with z's interior.

But there's a subtlety. Since TPP(z,y), z touches the boundary of y. If the boundaries of x and y coincide at the point where z touches y's boundary, then the interiors of x and z might overlap, making PO(x,z) true, not EC(x,z).

For EC(x,z) to be true, x must touch z at a point that's not where z touches y's boundary. This is certainly possible. For example, z could touch y's boundary at one point and touch x's boundary at a different point, with no overlap between the interiors of x and z.

But wait. I think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is whether EC(x,z) is possible, not whether it's the only possibility.

Given TPP(z,y), z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
Given PO(x,y), x has parts inside y and parts outside.

It's possible for x to be positioned so that it touches z at its boundary but doesn't overlap with z's interior. This is not ruled out by the given conditions.

So, after careful consideration, I believe EC(x,z) is possible.

I'm now fully convinced that the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me be truly convinced once and for all. I'll think through concrete examples for all five of these relationships.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Example: Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10. Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 5. Let x be a circle centered at the point (-5,5) with radius 4. The circles x and y overlap, satisfying PO(x,y). The circle z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, satisfying TPP(z,y). And the circles x and z don't overlap, satisfying DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
   Example: Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10. Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 5. Let x be a circle centered at the point (5,10) with radius 5. The circles x and y overlap, satisfying PO(x,y). The circle z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, satisfying TPP(z,y). And the circles x and z touch at a point but don't share interior, satisfying EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Example: Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10. Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 5. Let x be a circle centered at the point (5,5) with radius 6. The circles x and y overlap, satisfying PO(x,y). The circle z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, satisfying TPP(z,y). And the circles x and z partially overlap, satisfying PO(x,z).

4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Example: Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10. Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 5. Let x be a shape that includes z and extends beyond y at the point where z touches y's boundary. Specifically, x could be a shape that includes all points inside the circle centered at (5,5) with radius 7, except for points outside the circle centered at the origin with radius 10 that are also outside the circle centered at (5,0) with radius 5. This shape x partially overlaps with y, satisfying PO(x,y). The circle z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, satisfying TPP(z,y). And the circle z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary at the point where it touches y's boundary, satisfying TPP(z,x).

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Example: Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10. Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 5. Let x be a shape that includes z and extends beyond y at the point where z touches y's boundary. Specifically, x could be a shape that includes all points inside the circle centered at (5,5) with radius 8, except for points outside the circle centered at the origin with radius 10 that are also outside the circle centered at (7,-2) with radius 7. This shape x partially overlaps with y, satisfying PO(x,y). The circle z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, satisfying TPP(z,y). And the circle z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPP(z,x).

These examples confirm that all five relationships are possible. So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I made an error in my NTPP(z,x) example. Let me try a simpler one for NTPP(z,x).

Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 4. Note that z is inside y and touches y's boundary at the point (9,0).
Let x be a circle centered at the point (0,0) with radius 15.

In this setup, x and y overlap (PO(x,y)), z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary (NTPP(z,x)).

Wait, this isn't right either. If x is a circle centered at the origin with radius 15, then x completely contains y, which contradicts PO(x,y).

Let me try yet another example for NTPP(z,x).

Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 4. Note that z is inside y and touches y's boundary at the point (9,0).
Let x be a non-circular shape that includes all points inside the circle centered at (0,10) with radius 15, but excludes all points outside the circle centered at the origin with radius 10 that are also outside the circle centered at (5,0) with radius 4.

This shape x overlaps with y but neither contains the other, satisfying PO(x,y). The circle z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, satisfying TPP(z,y). And the circle z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me try one more time with the NTPP(z,x) example.

Let y be a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
Let z be a circle centered at the point (5,0) with radius 4. Note that z is inside y and touches y's boundary at the point (9,0).
Let x be a circle centered at the point (5,5) with radius 10.

In this setup, x and y overlap (PO(x,y)) because neither circle completely contains the other. The circle z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary at the point (9,0), satisfying TPP(z,y).

Now, let's check if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. The distance from the center of z to the center of x is sqrt(5^2) = 5. The radius of x is 10 and the radius of z is 4. For z to be completely inside x, the distance between their centers should be less than the radius of x minus the radius of z, which is 10 - 4 = 6. Since 5 < 6, z is completely inside x.

The point where z touches y's boundary is (9,0). The distance from this point to the center of x, which is (5,5), is sqrt((9-5)^2 + (0-5)^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41) ≈ 6.4. Since the radius of x is 10 and 6.4 < 10, the point (9,0) is inside x, not on its boundary. So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, satisfying NTPP(z,x).

So, this example confirms that NTPP(z,x) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

DC = Disconnected
EC = Externally Connected
PO = Partially Overlap
TPP = Tangential Proper Part
NTPP = Non-Tangential Proper Part

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's clarify what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected if x overlaps with parts of y that don't include z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z can be externally connected if x touches z at its boundary without sharing interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap if part of x that's inside y overlaps with part of z.

4. TPP(z,x): z can be a tangential proper part of x if x completely contains z and z touches x's boundary.

5. NTPP(z,x): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x if x completely contains z and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

The relationships TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because x has parts outside of y (since PO(x,y)), while z is completely within y.
