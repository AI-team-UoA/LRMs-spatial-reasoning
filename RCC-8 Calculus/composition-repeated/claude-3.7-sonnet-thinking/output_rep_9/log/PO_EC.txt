PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem carefully. We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

We need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let's think about the spatial configurations:

When x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y)) and y externally connects with z (EC(y,z)), we need to consider various configurations of x relative to the y-z boundary.

Here are the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y does not reach the boundary where y and z touch.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is possible if x reaches exactly to the boundary where y and z touch.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This isn't immediately obvious if it's possible because y and z only touch at their boundary and don't share interior parts. For x to partially overlap with z, it would need to cross the y-z boundary and extend into z's interior.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This would mean x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Given that y and z only touch at their boundaries, it's not clear if this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This would mean x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary. This seems impossible given the constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. Given that y and z only touch at their boundaries, it's not clear if this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary. This seems unlikely given the constraints.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. This seems highly unlikely given the constraints.

Let me reconsider these more carefully:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Yes, this is possible. If the part of x that overlaps with y is far from the y-z boundary, then x and z could be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Yes, this is possible. If the part of x that overlaps with y extends to the y-z boundary, then x and z could be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This would require x to share interior points with z. Since y and z only share boundary points, for x to overlap with z, it would need to extend beyond y into z, which seems possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: For x to be a tangential proper part of z, it would need to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that y and z only touch at their boundary, it's hard to see how x, which partially overlaps with y, could be entirely inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Similar to TPP, but even less likely since x would not even touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given that y and z only touch at their boundary, it's hard to see how z could be entirely inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Similar to TPPi, but even less likely since z would not even touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: For x and z to be equal, they would have to be the same region. Given that y partially overlaps with x but only touches z at the boundary, it's hard to see how x and z could be the same.

Wait, I think I've been too restrictive in my analysis. Let me try to create specific examples for each relation to see which ones are possible.

For DC(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle that partially overlaps with y, but is far from the y-z boundary. Then x and z would be disconnected.

For EC(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle that partially overlaps with y and extends just to the y-z boundary without crossing it. Then x and z would be externally connected.

For PO(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle that partially overlaps with y and also extends across the y-z boundary into z. Then x and z would partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z):
It's hard to imagine how x could be entirely inside z if it partially overlaps with y and y only touches z at the boundary. For x to be inside z, it would need to cross the y-z boundary, but then it wouldn't be partially overlapping with y; it would be part of y.

For NTPP(x,z):
Similar to TPP, but even less likely.

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is entirely inside x, and y partially overlaps with x, and y and z touch at the boundary, it's hard to reconcile these constraints. It would seem that y and z wouldn't just touch at the boundary in this case.

For NTPPi(x,z):
Similar to TPPi, but even less likely.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are the same region, and y partially overlaps with x, then y would also partially overlap with z, not just touch it at the boundary.

Let me re-evaluate again. I think I need to better visualize the scenarios.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful about the constraints, particularly about "touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts" in the EC relation, and "share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other" in the PO relation.

Let's reconsider systematically:

We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is part of the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
   If the part of x that overlaps with y is far from the y-z boundary, then x and z could be disconnected. Yes, this is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   If the part of x that overlaps with y extends to the y-z boundary without crossing it, then x and z could be externally connected. Yes, this is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   For x to partially overlap with z, x must extend across the y-z boundary into z. This seems possible. x can overlap with part of y away from the y-z boundary, and also extend into z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. If x partially overlaps with y, then some part of x is inside y and some part is outside y. For x to be entirely inside z, the part of x that's outside y must also be inside z. And the part of x that's inside y must also be inside z, which means it must be in the part of z that's outside y. This seems impossible given that y and z only touch at their boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   Similar to TPP, but even less likely as x would not even touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. If y partially overlaps with x, and y touches z at the boundary, then z could be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. I need to check if this is consistent with the other constraints.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   Similar to TPPi, but z would not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   If x and z are the same region, and y partially overlaps with x, then y would also partially overlap with z, not just touch it at the boundary. This is impossible.

Let me re-analyze 6 and 7. 

For TPPi(x,z):
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. If y partially overlaps with x, and y touches z at the boundary, it's possible that z is entirely inside x. The part of y that's outside x would touch z at the boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. But if y and z touch at their boundaries, and y and x share some interior points, it seems like z would touch x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) seems impossible.

Let me re-analyze 4 again:

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. If x partially overlaps with y, then some part of x is inside y and some part is outside y. For x to be entirely inside z, all of x must be inside z. This means the part of x that's inside y must also be inside z. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points, it's hard to see how a point could be both inside y and inside z. So, TPP(x,z) seems impossible.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful. Just because y and z touch at the boundary doesn't mean that the entire boundary of y is touching z, or vice versa. It just means there's at least one boundary point in common.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. If x partially overlaps with y, then some part of x is inside y and some part is outside y. For x to be entirely inside z, all of x must be inside z. The part of x that's inside y must also be inside z. But since y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points, a point that's inside y can't also be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Let me try a different approach, by considering examples for each possible relation between x and z.

For DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
Imagine y as a circle in the middle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y, and z as a circle that touches y on the right. Then x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
Imagine y as a circle in the middle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and extends to the right edge of y, and z as a circle that touches y on the right. Then x and z touch at a point.

For PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
Imagine y as a circle in the middle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and also extends to the right beyond y, and z as a circle that touches y on the right and also extends to the right. Then x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. But if x partially overlaps with y, then some part of x is inside y and some part is outside y. Since y and z only touch at their boundaries, a point that's inside y can't also be inside z. So, if part of x is inside y, that part can't be inside z, which means x can't be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

For NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
Similar to TPP, but even less likely as x would not even touch z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. If y partially overlaps with x, and y touches z at the boundary, it's possible that z is entirely inside x. 

Wait, I need to be more careful here. If z is entirely inside x, and y partially overlaps with x, then y and z can only touch at the boundary if y also overlaps with z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

For NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
Similar to TPPi, but even less likely as z would not even touch x's boundary.

For EQ(x,z) - Equal:
If x and z are the same region, and y partially overlaps with x, then y would also partially overlap with z, not just touch it at the boundary. This contradicts EC(y,z), so EQ(x,z) is impossible.

I think I need to be more careful about the definitions again.

For TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. If y partially overlaps with x, and y touches z at the boundary, then z could be entirely inside x. The touch between y and z would happen at a point on x's boundary.

OK, let me draw some pictures to help me think:

For TPPi(x,z), let's imagine:
- x is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle entirely inside x, touching x's boundary at one point
- y is a circle that partially overlaps with x (so part of y is inside x, part is outside)
- y and z touch at their boundaries, and this touch happens at the point where z touches x's boundary

Thinking about it this way, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me just double-check NTPPi(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle entirely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- y is a circle that partially overlaps with x
- y and z touch at their boundaries

But for y to touch z at the boundary, and for z to not touch x's boundary, y would have to extend into x to touch z. But if y extends into x to touch z, and z is entirely inside x, then y and z would have to overlap, not just touch at the boundary. This contradicts EC(y,z), so NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part

Wait I think I need to analyze TPPi(x,z) again to convince myself.

For TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. If y partially overlaps with x, and y touches z at the boundary, then for this to be consistent, the touch between y and z must happen at a point on x's boundary.

Let's imagine:
- x is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle entirely inside x, touching x's boundary at one point
- y is a circle that partially overlaps with x
- y and z touch at their boundaries, and this touch happens at the point where z touches x's boundary

But for y to touch z at the boundary, y must reach to the point where z touches x's boundary. But this point is also on x's boundary. If y reaches this point, then y would also have to touch x's boundary, not just overlap with x. This means that y would be outside x in some parts, and the part of y that touches z would be exactly at the boundary of x. This is consistent with PO(x,y) because y shares interior points with x, and neither is part of the other.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me just review the other relations quickly:

DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Yes, this is possible.
EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Yes, this is possible.
PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Yes, this is possible.
TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: No, this is impossible.
NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: No, this is impossible.
TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Yes, this is possible.
NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: No, this is impossible.
EQ(x,z) - Equal: No, this is impossible.

OK so there are 4 possible relations:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part

Actually, let's just triple-check the reasoning for TPPi(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y and z touch at the boundary, and y partially overlaps with x, then the touch between y and z would happen at a point on the boundaries of both y and z. This point would also be on the boundary of x because z is a tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with PO(x,y) because y shares interior points with x, and neither is part of the other.

Actually, let me draw the picture differently. Imagine:
- x is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle entirely inside x, touching x's boundary at one point P
- y is a circle that's mostly outside x, but it extends into x just enough to touch z at the point P
- y and x share some interior points (i.e., PO(x,y)), but the touch between y and z happens exactly at the point P, which is on the boundaries of x, y, and z

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me now triple check NTPP(x,z) and TPP(x,z):

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If y partially overlaps with x, then some part of y is inside x and some part is outside x. Since x is entirely inside z, the part of y that's inside x is also inside z. But the part of y that's outside x could be either inside or outside z. But we are told that EC(y,z), which means that y and z touch at the boundary and don't share interior points. So, the part of y that's inside x (and thus inside z) would also be inside y and inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

For TPP(x,z):
Similarly, if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. If y partially overlaps with x, then some part of y is inside x and some part is outside x. Since x is entirely inside z, the part of y that's inside x is also inside z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says that y and z don't share interior points. So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part

I think this is correct. However let me check again for TPPi(x,z). Imagine z is entirely within x, and touches x at a single boundary point. y partially overlaps with x. y and z touch at their boundaries. 

Now that I think about it more, EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary. For z to be entirely within x, that boundary touch would have to be at a boundary of x as well. But we know PO(x,y), which means some of y is inside x, and some of y is outside x. But if the boundary touch between y and z has to be at the boundary of x, then that's the only place where y can contact z. But that contact would be a boundary touch, not an overlap. That doesn't seem consistent with PO(x,y). If z is truly inside x and touching the boundary of x, and y is partially overlapping x, then y should overlap with z in the interior of x, not just touch z at the boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) seems impossible.

Actually, I need to be more careful. PO(x,y) means that x and y share interior points, but it doesn't mean that y has to overlap with every part of x. It's possible for y to overlap with part of x without overlapping with z, even if z is inside x.

Imagine:
- x is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle entirely inside x, touching x's boundary at one point P
- y is a circle that overlaps with the left half of x, but doesn't reach z
- y and z touch at the point P, which is on the boundaries of x, y, and z

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

OK let me just redouble check the reasoning for TPPi(x,z). 

If z is entirely within x and touches x at a point P on the boundary of x, and if y partially overlaps with x, it's still possible for y and z to touch at the point P without y overlapping with z.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
4. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part

Let me double check each of these:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
Imagine y as a circle in the middle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y, and z as a circle that touches y on the right. Then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
Imagine y as a circle in the middle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and extends to the right edge of y, and z as a circle that touches y on the right exactly where x touches the right edge of y. Then x and z touch at a point.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
Imagine y as a circle in the middle, x as a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and also extends to the right beyond y, and z as a circle that touches y on the right and also extends to the right, overlapping with the part of x that's to the right of y. Then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. Given that y partially overlaps with x, and y and z touch at the boundary, I need to check if this is consistent.

Imagine:
- x is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle entirely inside x, touching x's boundary at one point P
- y is a circle that overlaps with part of x, with the boundary of y passing through the point P
- y and z touch at the point P, which is on the boundaries of x, y, and z

This scenario seems consistent with all the given constraints: PO(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z). The key insight is that the touch between y and z happens at a point on the boundary of x, and y partially overlaps with x without overlapping with z.

Actually, let me test this with a specific example. Let's say:
- x is the circle with center at (0,0) and radius 2
- z is the circle with center at (1,0) and radius 1, so it's entirely inside x and touches x at the point (2,0)
- y is the circle with center at (1.5, 1.5) and radius 1.5, so it overlaps with part of x and its boundary passes through the point (2,0)

In this configuration:
- x and y share interior points, and neither is part of the other, so PO(x,y) holds.
- y and z touch at the point (2,0) but don't share interior points, so EC(y,z) holds.
- z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary at the point (2,0), so TPPi(x,z) holds.

Wait, that doesn't seem right: y's boundary passes through the point (2,0), and z's boundary also passes through the point (2,0), and both of these points are in the interior of y and z respectively? Let me try again. I think I need to be more careful.

Let me reason step by step:
- x is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle entirely inside x, touching x's boundary at one point P
- For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary.
- For EC(y,z) to hold, y and z must touch at the boundary but not overlap.
- For PO(x,y) to hold, x and y must share interior points, but neither is part of the other.

Given these constraints, the touch between y and z must happen at a point on the boundary of z. This point could be the point P where z touches x's boundary. For y to touch z at this point without overlapping with z, y's boundary must pass through this point. But for y to partially overlap with x, y's boundary must intersect with x's boundary at at least two points. This means that y's boundary can't just pass through the point P; it must also intersect with x's boundary at another point.

Actually, let me go back to my earlier example:
- x is the circle with center at (0,0) and radius 2
- z is the circle with center at (1,0) and radius 1, so it's entirely inside x and touches x at the point (2,0)
- y is the circle with center at (1.5, 1.5) and radius 1.5

Let's check: 
- The distance between the center of y and the center of x is sqrt((1.5)^2 + (1.5)^2) = sqrt(4.5) = 2.12, which is greater than 2, so the center of y is outside x.
- The distance between the center of y and the center of z is sqrt((1.5-1)^2 + (1.5-0)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 1.5^2) = sqrt(2.5) = 1.58, which is greater than 1, so the center of y is outside z.

Actually I realize my intuition is wrong. Let me think more carefully.

For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. Let's say z touches x's boundary at a point P. For y to touch z at the boundary, y's boundary must pass through a point on z's boundary. This could be the point P, or it could be a different point on z's boundary. But for y to partially overlap with x, some of y must be inside x and some must be outside x. This is consistent with y's boundary passing through the point P and also intersecting with x's boundary at another point.

Actually I still can't get a concrete picture where TPPi(x,z) is consistent with the constraints. Let me actually test for z = TPPi(x).

For TPPi(x,z), z must be a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. For EC(y,z), y and z must touch at the boundary but not overlap. For PO(x,y), x and y must share interior points, but neither is part of the other.

Let me try to set up a concrete example:
- x is the circle with center at (0,0) and radius 2
- z is the circle with center at (1,0) and radius 1, so it's entirely inside x and touches x at the point (2,0)
- y is ???

For EC(y,z) to hold, y and z must touch at the boundary but not overlap. This means that the distance between the centers of y and z must be equal to the sum of their radii. Let's say y has radius r and center at (a, b). Then:
sqrt((a-1)^2 + (b-0)^2) = r + 1

For PO(x,y) to hold, x and y must share interior points, but neither is part of the other. This means:
- The distance between the centers of x and y must be less than the sum of their radii (so they overlap).
- The distance between the centers of x and y must be greater than the absolute difference of their radii (so neither is inside the other).

So:
|r - 2| < sqrt(a^2 + b^2) < r + 2

I need to find values of a, b, and r that satisfy these constraints. 

Let's try:
- a = 3
- b = 0
- r = 2

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((3-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2, which is equal to r + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which is not correct.

Let me try again:
- a = 3
- b = 0
- r = 2

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((3-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2, which should be equal to r + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, but it's not.

OK, let's try a different approach:
- y and z should touch at a point on the boundary of both.
- z is entirely inside x, touching x's boundary at a single point.
- y partially overlaps with x.

Let me try:
- a = 2
- b = 0
- r = 1

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((2-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 1, which equals r + 1 - 1 - 1 = 0, which is not what we want.

Let me try:
- a = 3
- b = 0
- r = 2

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((3-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2, which equals r + 1 - 2 - 1 = 0, which is not what we want.

OK, let's just try the constraint that y and z touch at a point on the boundary of both, meaning the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii:
sqrt((a-1)^2 + (b-0)^2) = r + 1

Let's try:
- a = 3
- b = 0
- r = 2

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((3-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2, which does not equal r + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

Let's adjust:
- a = 4
- b = 0
- r = 3

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((4-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 3, which equals r + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4, which is not correct.

I feel like I'm not setting up the constraint correctly. The constraint is that y and z touch at the boundary, which means the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii:
sqrt((a-1)^2 + (b-0)^2) = r + 1

Let's try:
- a = 4
- b = 0
- r = 3

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((4-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 3, which equals r + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4, which is not correct.

Let me rethink this. If z has center at (1,0) and radius 1, and y has center at (a,b) and radius r, then the distance between their centers is sqrt((a-1)^2 + b^2). For y and z to touch at the boundary, this distance should equal r + 1.

Let's try:
- a = 4
- b = 0
- r = 3

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((4-1)^2 + 0^2) = 3, which equals r + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4, which is not correct.

OK, I think I miscalculated. The distance between (4,0) and (1,0) is 3, and the sum of the radii is 3 + 1 = 4, which is not equal. So, this doesn't work.

Let's try:
- a = 5
- b = 0
- r = 4

Then:
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((5-1)^2 + 0^2) = 4, which equals r + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, which is not correct.

OK, I'm getting frustrated with my calculations. Let me double check:
- distance from (5,0) to (1,0) = |5 - 1| = 4
- sum of radii = 4 + 1 = 5

So, the distance is not equal to the sum of the radii, which means y and z don't touch at the boundary.

Let me try a different approach. If the centers of y and z are d units apart, and y and z have radii r and 1 respectively, then for y and z to touch at the boundary, we need d = r + 1. Let's choose d and r first:
- d = 4
- r = 3

Then, the centers are 4 units apart, and the sum of the radii is 3 + 1 = 4, which is equal to d. So, y and z touch at the boundary. Let's place the center of y at (5, 0), which is 4 units away from the center of z at (1, 0).

Now, let's check if PO(x,y) holds. For x and y to partially overlap, the distance between their centers should be less than the sum of their radii, but greater than the absolute difference of their radii. The distance between the centers of x and y is sqrt((0-5)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 5. The sum of their radii is 2 + 3 = 5, and the absolute difference is |2 - 3| = 1. So, 1 < 5 < 5, which is not strictly less than the sum. But at exactly equal to the sum, x and y would touch at the boundary, not overlap.

Let me adjust:
- Center of y at (4.5, 0)
- Radius of y = 3

Then, the distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((4.5-1)^2 + 0^2) = 3.5, which is less than the sum of the radii, 3 + 1 = 4. This means y and z overlap, not just touch at the boundary.

Let's adjust again:
- Center of y at (5, 0)
- Radius of y = 3

Then, the distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((5-1)^2 + 0^2) = 4, which equals the sum of the radii, 3 + 1 = 4. So, y and z touch at the boundary.

The distance between the centers of x and y is sqrt((0-5)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 5, which equals the sum of their radii, 2 + 3 = 5. So, x and y touch at the boundary, not overlap.

Let me adjust again to ensure x and y overlap:
- Center of y at (4, 0)
- Radius of y = 3

Then, the distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((4-1)^2 + 0^2) = 3, which is less than the sum of the radii, 3 + 1 = 4. This means y and z overlap, not just touch at the boundary.

Let me adjust again:
- Center of y at (4, 0)
- Radius of y = 2

Then, the distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((4-1)^2 + 0^2) = 3, which equals the sum of the radii, 2 + 1 = 3. So, y and z touch at the boundary.

The distance between the centers of x and y is sqrt((0-4)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 4, which is less than the sum of their radii, 2 + 2 = 4. So, x and y touch at the boundary, not overlap.

OK, I've been struggling to find a concrete example where TPPi(x,z) is consistent with the constraints, which makes me think it might be impossible. Let me go back to the reasoning.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. For EC(y,z) to hold, y and z must touch at the boundary but not overlap. For PO(x,y) to hold, x and y must share interior points, but neither is part of the other.

If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary at a point P, and y touches z at the boundary, this touch could happen at the point P or at a different point on z's boundary. If the touch happens at a point other than P, then for y to partially overlap with x, y's boundary would have to enter and exit x, which is possible. But if the touch happens at the point P, then for y to partially overlap with x, y's boundary would have to cross x's boundary at another point, which is also possible.

So, it seems like TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible. The key is to ensure that y touches z at the boundary and also partially overlaps with x.

Let me try again with a concrete example:
- x is the circle with center at (0,0) and radius 2
- z is the circle with center at (1,0) and radius 1, so it's entirely inside x and touches x at the point (2,0)
- y is the circle with center at (3,0) and radius 2, so it touches z at the point (2,0) and touches x at the same point, but doesn't overlap with either.

Wait, this doesn't satisfy PO(x,y), because x and y just touch at the boundary, they don't overlap.

Let me modify the example:
- x is the circle with center at (0,0) and radius 3
- z is the circle with center at (1,0) and radius 1, so it's entirely inside x
- y is the circle with center at (2,2) and radius 2

Let's check:
- z is entirely inside x because the distance between their centers is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = 1, which is less than 3 - 1 = 2 (the difference of the radii).
- z touches x's boundary at the point (2,0).
- The distance between the centers of y and z is sqrt((2-1)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) = 2.24, which is close to, but not exactly, the sum of their radii, 2 + 1 = 3.

This example doesn't work because y and z don't touch at the boundary.

OK, I think I have a counterexample for TPPi(x,z):
- If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary at a point P, and y touches z at the boundary, this touch must happen at a point on z's boundary, let's call it Q.
- If Q is not the same as P, then Q is strictly inside x. For y to touch z at Q, y's boundary must pass through Q. But for PO(x,y) to hold, y's boundary must also intersect with x's boundary at at least two points. This means that y's boundary must enter x through one point on x's boundary, pass through Q, and then exit x through another point on x's boundary. But if y's boundary passes through Q, which is strictly inside x, then y must overlap with the part of z that's near Q. This contradicts EC(y,z).
- If Q is the same as P, then Q is on the boundary of x. For y to touch z at Q, y's boundary must pass through Q. But for PO(x,y) to hold, y's boundary must also intersect with x's boundary at at least one other point. If y's boundary passes through Q, which is on the boundary of x, and also intersects with x's boundary at another point, then the part of y that's between these two points must be inside x. But then y would overlap with the part of z that's near Q, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Let me rethink. For y and z to touch at the boundary, their boundaries must meet at a single point, let's call it Q. For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary at a point P. If P and Q are the same point, then y, z, and x all touch at the same point. But for y to partially overlap with x, y's boundary must cross x's boundary at another point. This creates a problem: if y's boundary passes through P, which is on the boundary of both x and z, and y partially overlaps with x, then there must be some interior points of y that are inside x. But the part of y that's inside x near P would also have to be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, P and Q cannot be the same point.

If P and Q are different points, then Q is strictly inside x. For y to touch z at Q, y's boundary must pass through Q. But for PO(x,y) to hold, y's boundary must also intersect with x's boundary at at least two points. This means that y's boundary must enter x through one point on x's boundary, pass through Q, and then exit x through another point on x's boundary. But if y's boundary passes through Q, which is strictly inside x, then y must overlap with the part of z that's near Q. This contradicts EC(y,z).

OK I think I'm convinced that TPPi(x,z) is impossible, so the possible relationships are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping

Let me confirm these three again:

For DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
Imagine:
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with the left half of y
- y is a circle in the middle
- z is a circle that touches y on the right

Then, x and z are disconnected, satisfying DC(x,z).

For EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
Imagine:
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with the left half of y and extends to the right edge of y
- y is a circle in the middle
- z is a circle that touches y on the right at the same point where x extends to

Then, x and z touch at a single point, satisfying EC(x,z).

For PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
Imagine:
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with the left half of y and also extends to the right beyond y
- y is a circle in the middle
- z is a circle that touches y on the right and also extends to the right, overlapping with the part of x that's to the right of y

Then, x and z overlap, satisfying PO(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping

And just to be sure, the other relations are impossible:

TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x partially overlaps with y, then some part of x is inside y. Since y and z only touch at the boundary, the part of x that's inside y can't also be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Similar to TPP, but even less likely.

TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: if z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. But for y to touch z at the boundary and partially overlap with x, y's boundary would have to pass through a point on z's boundary, which would either contradict EC(y,z) or PO(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Similar to TPPi, but even less likely.

EQ(x,z) - Equal: If x and z are the same region, and y partially overlaps with x, then y would also partially overlap with z, not just touch it at the boundary. This contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is part of the other
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points

Let me analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
This is possible. Imagine x partially overlapping with the left portion of y, while z touches y's boundary on the right side. In this case, x and z would be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
This is possible. Imagine x partially overlapping with y and extending just far enough to touch z at the same point where y and z touch. x and z would touch at a boundary without sharing interior points.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
This is possible. Imagine x partially overlapping with y, but also extending beyond y's boundary to overlap with part of z. x and z would share some interior points without either being fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
This is impossible. If x is entirely inside z while touching z's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, then the part of x inside y would also have to be inside z. But this contradicts EC(y,z) which states that y and z don't share interior points.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
This is impossible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
This is impossible. If z is entirely inside x while touching x's boundary, and y touches z at the boundary, then y would have to extend into x to touch z. But for PO(x,y) to hold, y's boundary would need to both touch z and partially overlap with x, which creates a contradiction with EC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
This is impossible for similar reasons as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
This is impossible. If x and z are the same region, and y partially overlaps with x, then y would also partially overlap with z, contradicting EC(y,z).
