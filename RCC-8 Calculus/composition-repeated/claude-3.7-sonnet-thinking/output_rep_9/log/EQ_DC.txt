PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this logically.

1. We're given that EQ(x,y), which means that x and y are coincident. In other words, x and y occupy exactly the same spatial region. 

2. We're also given that DC(y,z), which means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that x and y are exactly the same spatial region (EQ(x,y)), any relation that holds between y and z must also hold between x and z. 

So, since DC(y,z), it must also be the case that DC(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check:

If x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), then they have the same boundaries and interiors. If y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), then they share no spatial parts, including boundaries. Therefore, x and z must also share no spatial parts, which means DC(x,z).

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship x and z must have based on the given constraints.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no spatial parts)

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical in spatial extent, any spatial relationship that holds between y and another region must also hold for x with that region.

Therefore, if y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
