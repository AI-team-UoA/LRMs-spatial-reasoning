PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this. We're given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, meaning they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are essentially the same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that PO(x,y), and y and z are the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), then x must also partially overlap with z in the same way.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y share some spatial part
- x is not fully contained in y
- y is not fully contained in x

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z occupy exactly the same space

Therefore, x and z must have the same relationship as x and y, which is PO.

So, the answer is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me triple-check this with the properties of these spatial relations:

The RCC-8 relations are:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch but don't overlap)
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal

Given that EQ(y,z), y and z are interchangeable. Whatever relation x has with y, x must have the same relation with z. Since PO(x,y), it follows that PO(x,z).

So the final answer is: PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationship between x and z is affected by the given information.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some space, but neither is fully contained in the other)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent, any spatial relationship that x has with y must be the same relationship x has with z.

Since x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), and z occupies exactly the same space as y, then x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
