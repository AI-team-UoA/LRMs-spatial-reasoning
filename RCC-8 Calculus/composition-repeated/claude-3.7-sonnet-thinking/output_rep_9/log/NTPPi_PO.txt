PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, so I'm given two relationships:
1. NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): This means that y and z partially overlap. They share some common region, but neither is a part of the other.

I need to determine what relationship(s) could exist between x and z.

Let's think about this:

- x contains y completely and y doesn't touch x's boundary.
- y partially overlaps with z.

So, z can overlap with y, which is inside x. But z can also extend outside of y in various ways, which will determine its relationship with x.

Let's enumerate the possibilities:

1. z can be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. This would be NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).
2. z can be completely contained within x and touch x's boundary. This would be TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).
3. z can partially overlap with x, meaning that some of z is inside x and some is outside. This would be PO(x,z).
4. z can be completely outside x but touch x's boundary. This would be EC(x,z).
5. z can be completely outside x without touching x's boundary. This would be DC(x,z).

For clarity, z cannot be equal to x or contain x, because it partially overlaps with y, which is a proper part of x.

Actually, let me re-think this. There's an additional constraint: z must partially overlap with y. Given this:

1. z can still be completely contained within x, giving NTPP(z,x) or TPP(z,x).
2. z can extend outside of x, which would give PO(x,z).
3. Can z be completely outside x? No, because then z wouldn't overlap with y, which is completely inside x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: NTPP(z,x), TPP(z,x), and PO(x,z). Or, in terms of the inverse relationships: NTPPi(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and PO(x,z).

Actually, hold on. Let me double-check by imagining some concrete examples:

Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle fully contained within x (not touching x's boundary), and z as another circle.

Scenario 1: z overlaps with y but is also completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. This would be NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Scenario 2: z overlaps with y and is completely contained within x, but touches x's boundary. This would be TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

Scenario 3: z overlaps with y and also extends outside of x. This would be PO(x,z).

Scenario 4: Could z be equal to x? No, because then z would contain y, which contradicts the PO(y,z) relation.

Scenario 5: Could z contain x? No, for the same reason as above.

Scenario 6: Could z be disconnected from x? No, because then z would not overlap with y, which is fully contained within x.

Scenario 7: Could z be externally connected to x? No, for the same reason as Scenario 6.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: NTPPi(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and PO(x,z).

Ah, I made a mistake in my notation. Let me clarify:

- NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or equivalently, z contains x without x touching z's boundary.

Similarly:

- TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, or equivalently, z contains x with x touching z's boundary.

OK, I now need to figure out if I'm providing the correct answer. Let's think about it again.

We have NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z). So, y is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z.

Let me draw this out in terms of regions to clarify what we have.

We have x as a larger region, and y is a proper part of x that doesn't touch the boundary of x. And z is a region that partially overlaps with y.

Since y is completely inside x, any part of z that overlaps with y must also be inside x. But z can extend outside of y in various ways.

1. z can be entirely within x, away from x's boundary: NTPP(z,x) (or equivalently NTPPi(x,z), but let's stick with one way of representation).
2. z can be entirely within x but touch x's boundary: TPP(z,x).
3. z can extend outside of x: PO(x,z).

Let's verify if I have the relationship directions correct by describing the relationship in words:

NTPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.

These seem correct.

Are there any other possibilities? 

z can't be equal to x (EQ(x,z)) because z partially overlaps with y, which is a proper part of x. If z were equal to x, then z would contain y, not partially overlap with it.

z can't be a proper part container of x (NTPP(x,z) or TPP(x,z)) for the same reason. If z contained x, then z would also contain y, not partially overlap with it.

z can't be disconnected from x (DC(x,z)) because z overlaps with y, which is inside x, so z must at least overlap with x.

z can't be externally connected to x (EC(x,z)) for the same reason as above.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: NTPP(z,x), TPP(z,x), and PO(x,z).

However, I previously said they were NTPPi(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and PO(x,z), which is incorrect. Let me double check once more by considering concrete examples:

Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside x (not touching the boundary), and z as another circle.

1. If z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, while also overlapping with y, then the relation is NTPP(z,x).
2. If z is entirely within x, touches x's boundary, and overlaps with y, the relation is TPP(z,x).
3. If z overlaps with y but also extends outside of x, the relation is PO(x,z).

So, the correct possible relationships are: NTPP(z,x), TPP(z,x), and PO(x,z).

Let me double check my reasoning again. 

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x, away from x's boundary.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. Some of y is in z, and some of z is in y.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z:

1. z can be entirely within x, away from x's boundary. This is NTPP(z,x).
2. z can be entirely within x, touching x's boundary. This is TPP(z,x).
3. z can have parts inside x (specifically, where it overlaps with y) and parts outside x. This is PO(x,z).
4. Can z be equal to x? No, because then z would contain y, not partially overlap with it.
5. Can z be a container of x? No, for the same reason.
6. Can z be disconnected from x? No, because z overlaps with y, which is inside x.
7. Can z be externally connected to x? No, for the same reason as 6.

I'm now confident that the possible relationships between x and z are: NTPP(z,x), TPP(z,x), and PO(x,z).

OK, so that's my answer.

Actually, let me double-check by reviewing the definitions again:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

I now confirm: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are: NTPP(z,x), TPP(z,x), and PO(x,z).

Let me check for any potential errors by considering the problem from a different angle. We can also express these relations using set-theoretic notions:

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper subset of the interior of x.
- PO(y,z) means that y and z have a non-empty intersection, but neither is a subset of the other.

Given these, z can be:
1. A proper subset of the interior of x. This is NTPP(z,x).
2. A proper subset of x that includes boundary points of x. This is TPP(z,x).
3. A set that has a non-empty intersection with x but is not a subset of x and x is not a subset of z. This is PO(x,z).

Now the question is how to express this using the RCC-8 relations. Let me double check the logic:

- NTPP(z,x) means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(z,x) means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(x,z) means x and z share a part, but neither is a part of the other.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Now, let's consider if I've missed any other possibility:

If z was equal to x (EQ(x,z)), then z would contain y, not partially overlap with it.
If z was a proper part container of x (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)), then z would also contain y, not partially overlap with it.
If z was disconnected from x (DC(x,z)), then z wouldn't overlap with y, which is inside x.
If z was externally connected to x (EC(x,z)), then z would only touch x at a boundary and wouldn't overlap with y, which is inside x.

So, these four cases are ruled out. The only possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, now I'm second-guessing myself on PO. Let me think again.

We have NTPPi(x,y) (which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x) and PO(y,z) (which means y and z partially overlap).

Now, consider PO(x,z): This means x and z share a part, but neither is a part of the other. This seems valid, because z overlaps with y (which is inside x), so z and x share a part. And since z can extend outside of x (to not be a proper part of x) and doesn't need to be a container of x, PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

I think my original answer is correct: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Let me double check this once more:

If NTPPi(x,y): y is fully contained in x, away from x's boundary.
If PO(y,z): y and z share some space, but neither is a part of the other.

Then, the relationship between x and z can be:
1. PO(x,z): x and z share some space (at least where y and z overlap), but neither is a part of the other.
2. TPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
3. NTPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Let me check if there are any other possibilities I might have missed:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This can't be the case because z overlaps with y, which is inside x.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. This can't be the case for the same reason as DC.
3. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. This can't be the case because if x and z were the same, then z would contain y, not partially overlap with it.
4. TPPi(x,z): x is a proper part of z. This can't be the case because if x is a proper part of z, then y (which is inside x) would be fully inside z, not partially overlapping with it.
5. NTPPi(x,z): x is a proper part of z. This can't be the case for the same reason as TPPi.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I'm now second-guessing myself on TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x). Let me consider these again:

TPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Now, if z is entirely contained within x, then z overlaps with y (which is also within x).

Actually, I think I need to be more precise about what PO(y,z) means. PO means "partially overlaps". This means that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

Given that y and z partially overlap, it's possible for z to:
1. Be entirely within x (this could be TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x) depending on whether z touches x's boundary).
2. Overlap with x but not be entirely contained within x (this would be PO(x,z)).

So, my list of possible relationships between x and z is still: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, instead of arguing in circles, let me try an empirical approach by drawing out some examples:

1. NTPPi(x,y): y is fully inside x, away from x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

So, the question is: what can the relationship between x and z be?

Example 1: z is fully inside x, away from x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y. This would be NTPP(z,x).

Example 2: z is fully inside x, touches x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y. This would be TPP(z,x).

Example 3: z partially overlaps with y (which is inside x), but also extends outside of x. This would be PO(x,z).

Are there any other cases I'm missing?

Example 4: Could z be equal to x? If z were equal to x, then z would fully contain y, not partially overlap with it. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Example 5: Could z fully contain x? If z fully contained x, then z would also fully contain y, not partially overlap with it. So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Example 6: Could z be disconnected from x? If z were disconnected from x, then z wouldn't overlap with y, which is inside x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Example 7: Could z be externally connected to x? If z were externally connected to x, then z would only touch x at a boundary and wouldn't overlap with y, which is inside x. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

I think I've covered all the 8 relations in the RCC-8 calculus, and the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Hmm, I'm going to check more carefully. I feel a bit more uncertain than I'd like, which means I may have missed something. Let me try something different. Let's reason from the original conditions more systematically.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is fully inside x, away from x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other).

Reasoning for each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This can't be the case because z overlaps with y, which is inside x. So, z must also overlap with x. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. This can't be the case because EC means they don't share an interior. But z overlaps with y, which is inside x. So, z and x must share an interior. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible if z overlaps with y (which is inside x) but also extends outside of x. Thus, PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

4. TPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is fully inside x, touches x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y. Thus, TPP(z,x) is a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is fully inside x, away from x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y. Thus, NTPP(z,x) is a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This would mean z fully contains x. But if z fully contains x, then z also fully contains y (which is inside x). This contradicts the condition PO(y,z), which states that y and z partially overlap (neither fully contains the other). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This would mean z fully contains x and x is away from z's boundary. But if z fully contains x, then z also fully contains y. This again contradicts PO(y,z). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then z would fully contain y, not partially overlap with it. This contradicts PO(y,z). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this systematic reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

I'm still feeling unsure between:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

So, let me do a graphical check to validate my understanding. I'll think about the possible scenarios given the conditions.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is fully inside x, away from x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

Scenario 1: Let's say z is fully inside x, away from x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y. This would be NTPP(z,x).

Scenario 2: Let's say z is fully inside x, touches x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y. This would be TPP(z,x).

Scenario 3: Let's say z partially overlaps with y (which is inside x), but also extends outside of x. This would be PO(x,z).

It looks like these are the only valid scenarios given the conditions. So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

OK, let me check one more time, really carefully with a slightly different approach. We know:

NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully contained within the interior of x.
PO(y,z): This means y and z partially overlap. They share some interior but neither is a proper part of the other.

Let's consider each of the 8 relations for the relationship between x and z:

DC(x,z): Disconnected. x and z have no part in common. But since z partially overlaps with y, and y is entirely within x, z must share at least the overlap part with x. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

EC(x,z): Externally connected. x and z touch only at their boundaries. Since z partially overlaps with y, which is entirely within the interior of x, z must share some interior with x. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

PO(x,z): Partial overlap. x and z share some interior but neither is a proper part of the other. This is possible, for instance, if z partially overlaps with y and extends beyond the boundary of x.

TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible. For example, if z is contained entirely within x, touches the boundary of x, and partially overlaps with y.

NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely contained within the interior of x and doesn't touch the boundary. This is possible. For example, if z is contained entirely within the interior of x and partially overlaps with y.

TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean z entirely contains x and x touches the boundary of z. But if z entirely contains x, then z also entirely contains y (since y is inside x). This contradicts PO(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

NTPPi(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean z entirely contains x and x is inside the interior of z. But if z entirely contains x, then z also entirely contains y. This contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, then z entirely contains y (since x entirely contains y). This contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

I've verified this thrice now. I'm confident this is the correct answer.

Let me summarize the reasoning: If y is inside x and z overlaps with y, then z and x must also overlap in some way. z can be entirely within x (either touching x's boundary or not) or can extend beyond x. But z can't be equal to x, can't contain x, can't be disconnected from x, and can't only touch x at a boundary. 

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, wait. We need to be more careful about the PO(y,z) relation. PO means "partially overlaps". That means that y and z share some region, but neither is part of the other. I need to be careful about how this interacts with the constraints.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is fully inside x, away from x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

For z to partially overlap with y, z must share some region with y. Since y is fully inside x, any shared region between y and z must also be inside x. But for it to be a "partial" overlap, there must be a part of y not in z and a part of z not in y.

This constraint alone doesn't restrict where the "part of z not in y" might be. It could be:
- Inside x but outside y (e.g., z is fully inside x)
- Outside x completely (e.g., z extends beyond x)

But it can't be a case where z fully contains y (because then PO(y,z) wouldn't be true). So, z can't be equal to x or fully contain x.

Tracing through my logic above I get the following possible relations between x and z:

PO(x,z): z shares some region with x (at least the overlap with y), but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible if z overlaps with y but also extends outside of x.

TPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is fully inside x, touches x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y.

NTPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is fully inside x, away from x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y.

I think my reasoning is sound.

Let me just summarize this once more in a clean way to make sure I've been thorough:

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is fully inside x, away from x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

For z to partially overlap with y:
- z and y must share some region.
- There must be a part of y not in z.
- There must be a part of z not in y.

The question is: What are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's consider each of the 8 relations for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Since z partially overlaps with y and y is inside x, z must also overlap with x. So, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. Since z partially overlaps with y and y is inside x (away from x's boundary), z must share an interior with x. So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible. For example, z can partially overlap with y (which is inside x) and also extend outside of x.

4. TPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. z can be entirely within x, touch x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible. z can be entirely within x, away from x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This would mean z fully contains x. But if z fully contains x, then z also fully contains y (since y is inside x). This contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This would mean z fully contains x, and x is away from z's boundary. But if z fully contains x, then z also fully contains y. This contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then z fully contains y. This contradicts PO(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

I now feel very confident in this answer. But just to make sure, let me try to produce one more counterexample for the three cases that I've ruled out:

EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same, then z contains y completely. But for PO(y,z) to be true, z shouldn't fully contain y.

TPPi(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then z fully contains x, which means z also fully contains y. But for PO(y,z) to be true, z shouldn't fully contain y.

NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then z fully contains x, which means z also fully contains y. This contradicts PO(y,z).

I think I've been exhaustive and I've double-checked every step. I am confident in my answer. The possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me double check the PO relation. For PO(y,z), z and y share some space, but neither is a part of the other. Does this also rule out the situation where z is a part of y? If z is a part of y, then z would be a part of y, which contradicts PO(y,z).

So, for PO(y,z) to be true, z cannot be fully contained within y or fully contain y. So, I do feel very confident about my earlier ruling out of EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z). 

If z is a part of y, then it would be TPP(z,y) or NTPP(z,y), not PO(y,z). That contradicts our given relation.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

To wrap up, let me check once more the 8 relations for the relationship between x and z:

DC(x,z): Impossible because z must share the overlapping region with y, which is inside x.
EC(x,z): Impossible because z must share an interior with x, given that it shares an interior with y, which is inside x.
PO(x,z): Possible. z can partially overlap with y (which is inside x) and also extend outside of x.
TPP(z,x): Possible. z can be entirely within x, touch x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.
NTPP(z,x): Possible. z can be entirely within x, away from x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.
TPPi(x,z): Impossible. If z fully contains x, then z also fully contains y, which contradicts PO(y,z).
NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. For the same reason as TPPi(x,z).
EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z are the same, then z fully contains y, which contradicts PO(y,z).

The possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Ah, there's one final thing I need to double-check. Since we're working with RCC-8, which is based on the topology of regions, I need to check if I'm maintaining the correct directionality of the relations. 

The relations TPP and NTPP are directional. TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x, not x is a tangential proper part of z. Similarly, NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The relation PO is symmetric, so PO(x,z) is the same as PO(z,x).

So, to be consistent with the directionality and maintain clarity:

The possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

In plain language: x and z can partially overlap, z can be a tangential proper part of x, or z can be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I realized that I had a brief moment of confusion with the directionality of NTPPi. Let me check the definitions once more:

The RCC-8 relations are:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

So, NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Our first condition, NTPPi(x,y), means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. I got that right.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. Neither is a part of the other, but they share a spatial part. I got that right too.

OK, with that clarity, let me restate the possible relationships between x and z:

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Neither is a part of the other, but they share a spatial part.
TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary.
NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

These are the only possible relationships between x and z given the conditions NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Alright, I've been very careful with this and checked it several times. The correct answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

ANSWER:

Let me think through this step by step.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): This means y and z partially overlap. They share some space, but neither is contained within the other.

Now I need to determine what relationships could exist between x and z.

Since y is completely inside x, and z partially overlaps with y, we know that z must share some space with x (at least the part where z overlaps with y). But how else could z relate to x?

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible. If z were disconnected from x, it couldn't overlap with y which is inside x.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible. If z only touched x at a boundary, it couldn't overlap with y which is strictly inside x.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z can partially overlap with y (which is inside x) and also extend outside of x.

4. TPP(z,x): Possible. z can be completely inside x, touch x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.

5. NTPP(z,x): Possible. z can be completely inside x, not touch x's boundary, and partially overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. If x were part of z, then y would be completely inside z (not partially overlapping).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. Same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x equals z, then y would be completely inside z (not partially overlapping).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)
