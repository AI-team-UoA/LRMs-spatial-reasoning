PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we know:
1. NTPPi(x,y) means that x properly contains y and y does not touch the boundary of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, away from x's boundary.
2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

Now we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent. This means that z has exactly the same spatial properties as y in relation to x.

Given that NTPPi(x,y), we know that:
- x properly contains y
- y does not touch the boundary of x

Since z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), we can conclude that:
- x properly contains z
- z does not touch the boundary of x

This corresponds exactly to the definition of NTPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. 

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident.

If y is a non-tangential proper part of x, and z is coincident with y, then z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

So we have NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relation holds between x and z based on the given conditions.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): x completely contains y, and y doesn't touch x's boundary
- EQ(y,z): y and z occupy exactly the same space (they are coincident)

Analysis:
Since EQ(y,z), this means y and z are spatially identical. Whatever spatial relationship y has with other regions, z will have the same relationship.

Since NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

Because z is identical to y (from EQ(y,z)), z must also be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
