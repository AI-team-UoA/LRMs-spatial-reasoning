PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

In this question, we're given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- EC(y,z): y and z are also externally connected.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, which could be any of the eight RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Let's think about this systematically:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z don't touch each other, even though they both touch y. Imagine y is between x and z, and there's no direct contact between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary. Imagine y, x, and z all meeting at a common point or along a common edge.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts. Imagine x and z both extending into each other's space, while both still touching y at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary. This is possible if y touches both x and z at the point where x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is NOT possible given the constraints. If x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y touches x at x's boundary, then y would have to be partially inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Similar to the TPP case, this is possible if y touches both x and z at the point where z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the NTPP case, this is NOT possible given the constraints.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means x and z occupy the exact same space. But if EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and x and z occupy the same space, then the relationships of y with x and z should be the same, which they are in this case. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me double-check EQ(x,z). If x and z are equal, and y is externally connected to both x and z, then yes, this is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

However, upon further reflection, I think I need to be more careful about NTPP and NTPPi. Let's reconsider:

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, and EC(x,y), then y must touch x at its boundary. But then y would have to penetrate z to reach x, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely inside x without touching its boundary, and EC(y,z), then y must touch z at its boundary. But then y would have to penetrate x to reach z, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me check the validity of TPP and TPPi again:

4. TPP(x,z): If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and EC(x,y), then y touches x at its boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(y,z), the point where y touches x must be on z's boundary as well. This is possible, so TPP(x,z) is a valid relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and EC(y,z), then y touches z at its boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y), the point where y touches z must be on x's boundary as well. This is possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid relationship.

Actually, I think I'm missing something here. Let's reason spatially, using the given constraints:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

Given these, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. Imagine a scenario where y is between x and z, and x and z don't touch each other.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. Imagine a scenario where x, y, and z all meet at a common point or along a common edge.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible too. Imagine x and z overlapping in a region, with y touching both of them at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): This is tricky. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches x at its boundary, then for y to be externally connected to z, y and z must touch at a point where x also touches z's boundary. This seems possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y touches x at its boundary, then y would have to penetrate z to reach x, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to NTPP, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y is externally connected to both x and z, then the relationships are consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait. I need to check my reasoning for EQ(x,z) one more time.

If EQ(x,z), then x and z occupy the exact same space. Now, if EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then we're saying that y is externally connected to both x and z. Since x and z are the same region, this makes sense.

OK, so my answer is:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Let me actually test each case using a spatial scenario.

1. DC(x,z): Imagine three circles in a row, where the middle one (y) touches both the left one (x) and the right one (z), but x and z don't touch each other. In this case, EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are satisfied, and DC(x,z) is true.

2. EC(x,z): Imagine three circles arranged in a triangle, where each circle touches the other two. In this case, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and EC(x,z) are all satisfied.

3. PO(x,z): Imagine two overlapping circles (x and z) with a third circle (y) touching both of them at points on their boundaries that are not in the overlapping region. In this case, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z) are all satisfied.

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine a circle x inside a larger circle z, with x touching the boundary of z at a point. Now, imagine a third circle y touching both x and z at the exact point where x touches z's boundary. In this case, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and TPP(x,z) are all satisfied.

5. TPPi(x,z): This is the same as TPP but with x and z swapped.

6. EQ(x,z): Imagine two coincident circles (x and z) and a third circle (y) touching the boundary of the coincident circles. In this case, EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and EQ(x,z) are all satisfied.

7. NTPP(x,z): Imagine a circle x completely inside a larger circle z, not touching its boundary. If y touches x at its boundary, it would have to penetrate through z, which would mean PO(y,z) or TPP(y,z), not EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. NTPPi(x,z): This is the same as NTPP but with x and z swapped, so it's also not possible.

From these scenarios, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Let me triple-check the TPP and TPPi cases since they're tricky.

TPP(x,z): 
- x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- EC(x,y): y touches x at x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y touches z at z's boundary.

For both EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) to be true, y must touch both x and z at their boundaries. And for TPP(x,z) to be true, x's boundary must intersect with z's boundary. This means the point where y touches x must be at the point where x touches z's boundary. This is a very specific arrangement, but it's possible.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), the point where y touches z must be at the point where z touches x's boundary.

Yes, the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z when we know that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation systematically:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Imagine y as a region between x and z, where x touches y and y touches z, but x and z don't touch each other.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. Imagine three regions arranged so they all meet at a common boundary point or line.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap while both still externally connect with y along their respective boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z touching z's boundary, with y touching both x and z at precisely the point where x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to penetrate z's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. Similar to TPP case but with roles reversed.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Mirror of the NTPP case.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. If x and z are identical, and y externally connects to this region, both EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are satisfied.
