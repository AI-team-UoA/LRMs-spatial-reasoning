PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the constraints and determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): This means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, let's think about what these constraints mean for the relationship between x and z.

Since TPPi(x,y), y is contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. 

So, what are the possible relationships between x and z? Let's go through the RCC-8 relations one by one:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But this is not possible because y touches z at their boundaries, and y is inside x touching x's boundary. So, at the very least, x and z would be touching at their boundaries.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is a possible relationship. Since y is inside x and touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, it's possible that x and z touch at exactly the same point(s) where y touches both of them.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is also a possible relationship. It's possible that x and z overlap in a region that includes parts of y and also some parts outside of y.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because y is inside x, and y touches z's boundary. If x were inside z, touching z's boundary, and y were inside x, touching x's boundary, then y would not be touching z's boundary, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reason.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is a possible relationship. Since y is inside x and y touches z at their boundaries, it's possible that z is also inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because if z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (which touches z's boundary) would also be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. This is not possible because y is a proper part of x, and y touches z's boundary. If x and z were coincident, then y would be a proper part of z, and it wouldn't just touch z's boundary, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Wait, I need to double-check my logic for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is indeed possible. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is also inside x and touches x's boundary, then y and z can be externally connected (touching at their boundaries) while both being inside x and touching x's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (which touches z's boundary) would also be inside x. 

Actually, for NTPPi(x,z), I think I made a mistake. Since y touches z's boundary and is inside x, touching x's boundary, it's possible that z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. 

Let me visualize this:
- x is the outermost region.
- y is inside x, touching x's boundary.
- z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- y and z touch at their boundaries.

This scenario is consistent with TPPi(x,y), EC(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is also a possible relationship.

Let me also re-examine DC(x,z):
If y touches x's boundary and z's boundary, it's not possible for x and z to be disconnected. They must at least touch at the point(s) where y touches both of them. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me re-check all the relationships again:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Since y is inside x and touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, it's possible that x and z touch at exactly the same point(s) where y touches both of them.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. This would mean x and z partially overlap. It's possible that x and z overlap in a region that includes parts of y and also some parts outside of y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But if x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reason.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Since y is inside x and y touches z at their boundaries, it's possible that z is also inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): I need to double-check this. 

Let me think through this more carefully. We have TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, which means they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, can z be completely inside x without touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,z))?

If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y must extend from z's boundary towards x's boundary. But this would mean y overlaps with z, contradicting EC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Hmm, I'm still not convinced about my analysis for NTPPi(x,z). Let me try to reason about it differently.

We have TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, for NTPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y must extend from z's boundary towards x's boundary (since y touches x's boundary, as per TPPi(x,y)).

But wait, if y and z touch at their boundaries and don't overlap, and y extends from z's boundary towards x's boundary, then z must be closer to the center of x than y is.

So, the scenario for NTPPi(x,z) would be:
- x is the outermost region.
- z is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- y is also inside x, extending from z's boundary to x's boundary.
- y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Actually, this scenario seems consistent with all the given constraints. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship after all.

Let me re-check all the relationships once more:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. If y touches x's boundary and z's boundary, it's not possible for x and z to be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries, with y being inside x and touching both x's boundary and z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y being inside x and touching both x's boundary and z's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z without touching z's boundary, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, with y being inside x and touching both x's boundary and z's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x without touching x's boundary, with y being inside x and extending from z's boundary to x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are coincident, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me be even more careful.

If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,z)), and y touches z's boundary, then y must extend from z's boundary in some direction. But y also touches x's boundary. So, y would overlap with z, contradicting EC(y,z).

No, I think I'm confused here. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This doesn't mean y can't extend in directions away from z.

Let me try to visualize this more clearly:
- x is the outermost region.
- z is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- y is inside x, touching x's boundary.
- y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

This scenario is consistent with all the given constraints, and it represents NTPPi(x,z).

I still need to be careful about the definition of EC(y,z). It means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. If y and z are touching at their boundaries, it means there's a point (or points) that belongs to both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Given that y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)) and y touches z's boundary (from EC(y,z)), it's possible that z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Actually, I think NTPPi(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double check TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) again.

TPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)), y would be inside z. But we also know that y touches z's boundary (from EC(y,z)), which is consistent with y being inside z and touching z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) might be possible.

Wait, if y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y would be a proper part of z. But EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries and don't overlap. This is inconsistent with y being a proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPP(x,z), this would contradict EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me also reexamine DC(x,z) more carefully. DC(x,z) would mean x and z don't share any points. But since y touches z's boundary and y is inside x, there's a point that belongs to both x and z (via y). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's reexamine the relationship PO(x,z). PO(x,z) would mean x and z partially overlap. Given that y is inside x and touches z's boundary, it's possible that x and z overlap in a way that part of z is inside x and part of it is outside x.

Let me also double check EC(x,z). EC(x,z) would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Since y is inside x and touches z's boundary, it's possible that x and z touch at exactly the same point(s) where y touches z.

And TPPi(x,z) would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given the constraints, this is also a possible relationship.

Lastly, NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. As we reasoned earlier, this is also a possible relationship.

So, after careful reconsideration, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me make sure I understand the definitions correctly:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Alright, the definitions seem consistent with my reasoning. 

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).

Actually, I think I need to be a bit more careful. Let's consider the case where z is larger than x. In that case, x could potentially be a proper part of z, or they could partially overlap.

But actually there's a constraint here: y touches z's boundary (from EC(y,z)). If x were inside z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, which would contradict EC(y,z). So, x cannot be inside z. This rules out TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Now, let's consider the case where z is inside x. There are two sub-cases:

1. z touches x's boundary: This corresponds to TPPi(x,z).
2. z doesn't touch x's boundary: This corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

For the first sub-case, TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches z's boundary, this is a consistent scenario.

For the second sub-case, NTPPi(x,z) means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This would mean that z is completely contained within x. But given that y touches z's boundary and y also touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), I need to be careful.

If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches both z's boundary and x's boundary, then y must stretch from z's boundary to x's boundary. This is consistent with the constraint that y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also a possible relationship.

Now, let's consider the case where x and z partially overlap. This corresponds to PO(x,z). Given the constraints, this is also a consistent scenario.

Lastly, let's consider the case where x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This corresponds to EC(x,z). Given the constraints, this is also consistent.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, let me actually double check PO(x,z). PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. But if x and z partially overlap, and y is inside x, then y and z might overlap too, which would contradict EC(y,z).

Well actually it depends on where exactly the overlapping region is between x and z. If the overlapping region doesn't include y, then it's consistent with EC(y,z).

Let me visualize this:
- x and z partially overlap in a region R.
- y is inside x but outside of R.
- y touches z's boundary.

This scenario is consistent with all the given constraints, so PO(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

So, my final conclusion is that the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me take a step back and approach this problem more systematically.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary).
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, let's think about what these constraints mean for the relationship between x and z.

1. Since y is inside x, and y touches z's boundary, x and z must at least be touching. This rules out DC(x,z).

2. Since y is inside x, and y touches z's boundary, x and z could be touching at their boundaries. This makes EC(x,z) a possible relationship.

3. Since y is inside x, and y touches z's boundary, it's possible that x and z partially overlap, as long as the overlapping region doesn't include y. This makes PO(x,z) a possible relationship.

4. If x were inside z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, which would contradict EC(y,z). This rules out TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

5. If z were inside x, there are two possibilities:
   a. z touches x's boundary: This corresponds to TPPi(x,z).
   b. z doesn't touch x's boundary: This corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).
   Both of these are consistent with the given constraints, so TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relationships.

6. If x and z were coincident, then y (which is inside x) would be inside z, which would contradict EC(y,z). This rules out EQ(x,z).

So, after systematic reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let's make another check. There's a subtlety to PO(x,z) that I need to clarify. 

PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. This means there's a region R that is part of both x and z, and there are parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x.

If y is inside x and touches z's boundary, we need to ensure that y doesn't overlap with z, as that would contradict EC(y,z).

If y is inside x, and y touches z's boundary, and x and z partially overlap, we need to ensure that y doesn't lie in the overlapping region of x and z. If y were in this overlapping region, it would be inside z, which would contradict EC(y,z). But since y is inside x, it's possible for y to be in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z, and still touch z's boundary.

So, PO(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

To summarize once more, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think I might have been overthinking the problem of NTPPi(x,z).

Let's be clear about what NTPPi(x,z) means: z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary (from EC(y,z)), then y must be at least partially inside x. But we know more: y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), which means y is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.

So, the scenario would be:
- x is the outermost region.
- z is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- y is inside x, touching x's boundary.
- y and z touch at their boundaries.

This scenario is consistent with all the given constraints, so NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But actually there's one more thing to consider: is DC(x,z) possible? I initially said no, reasoning that since y touches z's boundary and y is inside x, then x and z must at least be touching. Let's double check if this reasoning is sound.

If y is inside x and touches z's boundary, then there's a point on z's boundary that is also inside x. This means x and z have a point in common, which rules out DC(x,z) (since DC means they have no points in common).

So, DC(x,z) is indeed not possible, and the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I think this is the correct answer.

Actually, let me double check all of the possible answers once more.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary).
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If y is inside x and touches z's boundary, then there's a point on z's boundary that is also inside x. This means x and z have a point in common, which rules out DC(x,z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
   It's possible for x and z to touch at their boundaries, with y being inside x and touching both x's boundary and z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   It's possible for x and z to partially overlap, as long as y is in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z, and y touches z's boundary. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).
   If x is inside z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, which would contradict EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary).
   By the same reasoning as for TPP(x,z), this would contradict EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).
   It's possible for z to be inside x and touch x's boundary, with y being inside x and touching both x's boundary and z's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).
   It's possible for z to be inside x and not touch x's boundary, with y being inside x, touching x's boundary, and also touching z's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   If x and z are coincident, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, which would contradict EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after going through all the relationships, I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me confirm one more thing - in PO(x,z), can y actually touch z's boundary?

PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. So there's a region R that belongs to both x and z. Now, y is inside x and touches z's boundary. If y is inside x, it could be in region R (the overlapping region) or outside of it. If y is in region R, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). But if y is outside of region R, it would be in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z. But then, how could y touch z's boundary?

Actually, it's still possible. Even if y is in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z, y can extend up to the boundary of region R, which is part of z's boundary. 

So, the scenario would be:
- x and z partially overlap in a region R.
- y is inside x, outside of region R.
- y touches the boundary of region R, which is part of z's boundary.

This scenario is consistent with all the given constraints, so PO(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

To summarize once more, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I am confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) tell us and what constraints they place on the x-z relationship.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (meaning y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap)

Analyzing each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, x and z must share at least that point.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries exactly where y touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y being in the non-overlapping part of x while still touching z's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z, then y would also be inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, with y also being inside x and touching z's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), while y is inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).
