PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:

1. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

2. NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained in y but does not touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z. 

Given TPPi(x,y), y contains x and touches the boundary of x.
Given NTPPi(y,z), z is contained in y but doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, z is contained in y, and y is contained in x. By transitivity, z is contained in x.

But what specific RCC-8 relation holds between x and z? Let's think about it.

Since z is contained in y, and y touches the boundary of x, it's possible that z also touches the boundary of x. However, since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, it's also possible that z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relation would be TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then the relation would be NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's visualize this.

Since NTPPi(y,z), z contains y as a non-tangential proper part. This means y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Since TPPi(x,y), y contains x as a tangential proper part. This means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given this, can z touch the boundary of x? Let's see:
- y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary.
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Since x touches the boundary of y, and y is strictly inside z, x might still be strictly inside z. It's also possible that x touches the boundary of z.

Actually, I'm making a mistake in my interpretation. Let me clarify:

TPPi(x,y) means that x is contained in y and touches the boundary of y. It's the inverse of TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(y,z) means that y is contained in z and does not touch the boundary of z. It's the inverse of NTPP(z,y).

So, with this correct interpretation:
- x is contained in y and touches the boundary of y.
- y is contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that x is contained in y and y is contained in z, we can say that x is contained in z by transitivity.

Since x touches the boundary of y and y doesn't touch the boundary of z, x is definitely inside z, but it's unclear if x touches the boundary of z. We need to consider both possibilities.

If x touches the boundary of z, then the relation would be TPP(x,z).
If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then the relation would be NTPP(x,z).

However, given the constraints, can x touch the boundary of z? Let's think about it geometrically:
- x is inside y and touches the boundary of y.
- y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given that y is strictly inside z (it doesn't touch z's boundary), and x touches the boundary of y, x is still inside z. The question is whether x can extend to touch the boundary of z. Since y is strictly inside z, the boundary of y is entirely inside z. If x touches the boundary of y, it's still inside z and cannot reach the boundary of z.

Thus, x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, meaning the relation is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I'm still getting confused with the directions. Let me be very explicit.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

With this interpretation:
- y is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given the transitive property, z is contained within x. Now, we need to determine if z touches the boundary of x.

Since z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, z is definitely inside x. But the question is whether z can touch the boundary of x.

Given that z is strictly inside y (it doesn't touch y's boundary), and y touches the boundary of x, z is still inside x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and it's y (not z) that touches the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Thus, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, meaning the relation is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

I'm now confused because I've produced two different answers. Let me double-check.

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

By transitivity, z is inside x. But does z touch the boundary of x?

If z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is inside x touching the boundary of x, then z is inside x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me visualize this more clearly. Let's consider three concentric circles: the innermost is z, the middle one is y, and the outermost is x. 

Given TPPi(x,y), y contains x as a tangential proper part. This means x is inside y and touches the boundary of y.
Given NTPPi(y,z), z contains y as a non-tangential proper part. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, z contains y, and y contains x. By transitivity, z contains x. But what's the specific relation?

If x touches the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z, can x touch the boundary of z? It's possible, but it's also possible that x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Actually, I think I've been mixing up the directions of the relations. Let me clarify:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, x contains y, and y touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, y contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So:
- x contains y, and y touches the boundary of x.
- y contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, the question is: what's the relation between x and z?

Given that y contains z and x contains y, by transitivity, x contains z. The specific relation between x and z depends on whether z touches the boundary of x.

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (because NTPPi(y,z)), and y touches the boundary of x (because TPPi(x,y)), it's possible that z doesn't touch the boundary of x. But it's also possible that z does touch the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x.

Let me think about this a bit more.

If y touches the boundary of x, it means there's a common point between the boundary of y and the boundary of x. Now, if z doesn't touch the boundary of y, it means z is strictly inside y. Since y touches the boundary of x, and z is strictly inside y, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But I want to be absolutely sure. Let's think of this geometrically.

Imagine three regions: x, y, and z.

Given TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. Visualize this as y being inside x, with y's boundary touching x's boundary at some point.

Given NTPPi(y,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Visualize this as z being completely inside y, with z's boundary not touching y's boundary.

Now, where is z in relation to x?

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x. But does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, z is inside x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I think I've just been confusing myself. Let me break this down step by step with a consistent notation.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. Visualize as y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Visualize as z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Let's reason:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).
4. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is inside x, z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I think I've been misinterpreting TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). Let me double-check.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). In TPP(y,x), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). In NTPP(z,y), z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's reason about the relation between x and z:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).

But does z touch the boundary of x? Let's think about it:
- z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.

The fact that z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, suggests that z is inside x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I've been misunderstaning the question. Let me interpret the relations one more time.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y). TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. So, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's reason about the relation between x and z:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).

But does z touch the boundary of x? Let's think about it:
- z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.

Given that z is strictly inside y (it doesn't touch y's boundary), and y touches the boundary of x at some point, z can't touch the boundary of x. It's inside x but doesn't reach the boundary.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, at this point, let me just visualize this with set diagrams. If we represent these as three concentric sets, with x as the outermost, y inside x, and z inside y. Given that y touches the boundary of x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y, z is inside x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But let me think about it more. I think the confusion might arise because we're transitioning between different pairs of regions. Let's be very explicit.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

For TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(y,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's reason about the relation between x and z:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).

But does z touch the boundary of x? Let's think about it:
- z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.

Let's visualize: Imagine y as a circle inside a larger circle x, with y touching the boundary of x at one point. Now, imagine z as a smaller circle inside y, but not touching the boundary of y. Given this, z is inside x, but it doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I'm second-guessing myself. Let me once again clarify the definitions of these relations.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y). TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which implies:
- x is inside y.
- x touches the boundary of y.

So, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which implies:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which implies:
- y is inside z.
- y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which implies:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these interpretations, let's again reason about the relation between x and z:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).

Now, can z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and the boundary of y includes the point where y touches the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

This time, I think I have the correct interpretation.

Actually, let me just sanity check.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). In TPP(y,x), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

So, TPPi(x,y) implies:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). In NTPP(z,y), z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, NTPPi(y,z) implies:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these, let's reason about the relation between x and z:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).

But does z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x because it's strictly inside y, and the boundary of y (which z doesn't touch) includes the point where y touches the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the final answer is NTPPi(x,z).

But I'm wondering now whether I've been thinking about this too restrictively. Let me revisit the visualization to check.

TPPi(x,y):
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z):
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Let's visualize this:
x is the outermost region.
y is inside x, touching the boundary of x at some point(s).
z is inside y, but not touching the boundary of y.

Given this setup, can z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x at some point(s), z is inside x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, this time let me think about this in terms of general sets (not just circles) just to triple-check.

In terms of sets, TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper subset of x: $y \subset x$ and $y \neq x$.
- y has some common point(s) with the boundary of x: $\partial y \cap \partial x \neq \emptyset$.

NTPPi(y,z) means:
- z is a proper subset of y: $z \subset y$ and $z \neq y$.
- z has no common point with the boundary of y: $\partial z \cap \partial y = \emptyset$.

Given these, z is a proper subset of x by transitivity: $z \subset y \subset x$.

But does z have any common point with the boundary of x? If the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and the boundary of y touches the boundary of x, then the boundary of z can't touch the boundary of x.

Mathematically, if $\partial z \cap \partial y = \emptyset$ and $\partial y \cap \partial x \neq \emptyset$, then $\partial z \cap \partial x = \emptyset$.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

This is consistent with my previous conclusion.

Wait, I'm not actually sure that mathematical inference is right, because the boundaries are not always so straightforward. Let me think geometrically.

Visualize a region x. Inside x, there's a region y that touches the boundary of x at some point(s). Inside y, there's a region z that doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given this, can z touch the boundary of x? Since z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, z can't touch the boundary of x. It's inside x but doesn't reach the boundary.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I made a small logical error in my previous inference. Let me correct it.

If $\partial z \cap \partial y = \emptyset$ and $\partial y \cap \partial x \neq \emptyset$, it doesn't necessarily imply that $\partial z \cap \partial x = \emptyset$. This is because the boundary of x might extend in a way that it intersects with the boundary of z even if the boundary of z doesn't intersect with the boundary of y.

But in our specific context, we're talking about regions where one is inside the other. Given the constraints, z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y. Since y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at some point(s), z is inside x but can't touch the boundary of x. This is because z doesn't even touch the boundary of y, which is inside x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

This is consistent with my conclusion.

Let me double check one more time by drawing this out in my head.

In TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. Think of it as a smaller region inside a larger one, touching the larger one's boundary.

In NTPPi(y,z), z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. Think of it as an even smaller region inside the smaller one, not touching the smaller one's boundary.

Given this, z is inside x (because z is inside y, which is inside x). But can z touch the boundary of x? No, because z doesn't even touch the boundary of y, which is inside x. So, z is inside x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Hence, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I keep making a confusion. Let me be pedantically explicit:

1. TPPi(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is inside y and touches the boundary of y. It's the inverse of TPP(x,y).
2. NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. It's the inverse of NTPP(y,z).

Given these:
- x is inside y and touches the boundary of y.
- y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

By transitivity, x is inside z. But does x touch the boundary of z? Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is inside y (touching the boundary of y), x can't touch the boundary of z.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I've been interpreting the predicates differently. Let me review the definitions provided in the prompt.

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So, TPPi(x,y) implies:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, NTPPi(y,z) implies:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these, let's reason about the relation between x and z:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).

But does z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. This is because z is strictly inside y, and the boundary of y separates z from the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x).

Given the definition from the prompt, NTPP(z,x) means z is part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. The inverse of this is NTPPi(x,z), which means x is part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Wait, that's not right. I just said z is inside x, so x cannot be inside z. Let me re-evaluate.

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So, TPPi(x,y) implies:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, NTPPi(y,z) implies:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these, let's reason about the relation between x and z:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).

Does z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, z doesn't touch the boundary of x. z is strictly inside y, and y, while touching the boundary of x, also has parts that are not on the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In the RCC-8 calculus, the inverse of this relation is NTPPi(x,z), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Wait, that's wrong. If z is inside x, then NTPPi(x,z) would imply x is inside z, which is a contradiction. I think I'm making a simple logical error.

NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In the RCC-8 calculus, the inverse of this relation is NTPPi(x,z).

I think I'm getting confused because of the naming. Let's be clear:

NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Given our reasoning, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

To check this, let's refer to the definitions provided in the prompt:

TPPi(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Given these, let's reason:
1. x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. y is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
3. By transitivity, x is part of z (because x is part of y, and y is part of z).

Does x touch the boundary of z? Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is inside y (touching the boundary of y), x can't touch the boundary of z. x is confined to y, and since y doesn't reach the boundary of z, neither can x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Wait, I think I've been interpreting the predicates incorrectly, because of the inversive notation. Let me re-evaluate.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y). TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. So, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies:
- y is inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This implies:
- z is inside y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these, let's reason about the relation between x and z:
1. y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. z is inside y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.
3. By transitivity, z is inside x (because z is inside y, and y is inside x).

Does z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x. It's enclosed within y, which itself is enclosed within x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Ok so the final answer is NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I realize I need to be unambiguous. Let me be crystal clear.

If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x).

But also, NTPPi(x,z) means the same thing as NTPP(z,x). So NTPPi(x,z) is another valid answer.

So the answer is either NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z). These two mean the same thing.

Actually, the question is asking "what are the possible relationships between x and z", so I should list all the possibilities. But I've concluded that there's only one possibility.

So to summarize and answer the original question:

If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what these relations mean and how they combine.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y without touching y's boundary.

Let's determine the relationship between x and z:
1. y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.
2. z is contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
3. By transitivity, z is contained within x (since z is in y and y is in x).
4. Since z doesn't even touch the boundary of y, and y only touches the boundary of x at certain points, z cannot reach the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary, which means:

### Answer: NTPP(z,x)
