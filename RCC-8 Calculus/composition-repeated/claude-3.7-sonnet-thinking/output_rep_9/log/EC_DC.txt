PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out what are the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $EC(x,y)$ and $DC(y,z)$.

Let's think about what we know:
- $EC(x,y)$ means that $x$ and $y$ touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- $DC(y,z)$ means that $y$ and $z$ are disconnected and don't share any spatial parts.

Now I need to determine what are the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ from the set of RCC-8 relations:
- $DC(x,z)$ (disconnected)
- $EC(x,z)$ (externally connected)
- $PO(x,z)$ (partially overlapping)
- $TPP(x,z)$ (tangential proper part)
- $NTPP(x,z)$ (non-tangential proper part)
- $TPPi(x,z)$ (tangential proper part inverse)
- $NTPPi(x,z)$ (non-tangential proper part inverse)
- $EQ(x,z)$ (equal)

Since $y$ and $z$ are disconnected, and $x$ only touches $y$ at the boundary, there's no constraint that would force $x$ and $z$ to be connected in any way. 

Let's analyze each possible relation:

1. $DC(x,z)$: This is certainly possible. $x$ can be completely disconnected from $z$, since $y$ is disconnected from $z$ and $x$ only touches $y$ at the boundary.

2. $EC(x,z)$: This is also possible. $x$ can touch $z$ at the boundary, while still being externally connected to $y$.

3. $PO(x,z)$: This is possible too. $x$ can partially overlap with $z$, as long as the part of $x$ that overlaps with $z$ doesn't overlap with $y$ (since $y$ and $z$ are disconnected).

4. $TPP(x,z)$: This is possible. $x$ can be a tangential proper part of $z$, as long as the boundary of $x$ that touches $y$ also coincides with the boundary of $z$.

5. $NTPP(x,z)$: This is possible. $x$ can be completely inside $z$ (not touching $z$'s boundary), as long as the boundary of $x$ that touches $y$ doesn't overlap with $z$.

Wait, I think I need to be more careful here. Let me think again about what it means for $x$ to be a non-tangential proper part of $z$. It means that $x$ is completely inside $z$ and doesn't touch $z$'s boundary. But if $x$ touches $y$'s boundary (due to $EC(x,y)$), and $y$ is disconnected from $z$ (due to $DC(y,z)$), then the part of $x$ that touches $y$ can't also be inside $z$. So actually, I don't think $NTPP(x,z)$ is possible.

Let me reconsider point 5:

5. $NTPP(x,z)$: This is NOT possible. If $x$ is completely inside $z$ (not touching $z$'s boundary), then $x$ can't also touch $y$ which is disconnected from $z$.

Continuing:

6. $TPPi(x,z)$: This is possible. $z$ can be a tangential proper part of $x$, as long as the part of $x$ that touches $y$ doesn't overlap with $z$.

7. $NTPPi(x,z)$: This is possible. $z$ can be completely inside $x$ (not touching $x$'s boundary), as long as the part of $x$ that touches $y$ doesn't overlap with $z$.

8. $EQ(x,z)$: This is NOT possible. If $x$ is equal to $z$, then since $y$ is disconnected from $z$ (due to $DC(y,z)$), it means $y$ is also disconnected from $x$. But this contradicts the given condition that $EC(x,y)$.

Let me double-check each of these:

1. $DC(x,z)$: Yes, this is possible, as illustrated in many scenarios where $x$ and $z$ are completely separate.

2. $EC(x,z)$: Yes, this is possible. $x$ can touch $z$ at a different boundary point than where it touches $y$.

3. $PO(x,z)$: Yes, this is possible. $x$ can partially overlap with $z$, and the part of $x$ that doesn't overlap with $z$ can touch $y$.

4. $TPP(x,z)$: I need to think about this more carefully. If $x$ is a tangential proper part of $z$, it means that $x$ is entirely contained within $z$ but touches $z$'s boundary. Given that $EC(x,y)$, $x$ also touches $y$'s boundary. But since $DC(y,z)$, $y$ and $z$ don't share any parts or boundaries. This seems like a contradiction. If $x$ touches both $y$'s boundary and $z$'s boundary, then there would be a connection between $y$ and $z$ at that point, which contradicts $DC(y,z)$. So, I don't think $TPP(x,z)$ is possible.

5. $NTPP(x,z)$: As I concluded earlier, this is not possible.

6. $TPPi(x,z)$: Yes, this is possible. $z$ can be a tangential proper part of $x$, and the part of $x$ that's not covered by $z$ can touch $y$.

7. $NTPPi(x,z)$: Yes, this is possible. $z$ can be completely inside $x$, and a different part of $x$ can touch $y$.

8. $EQ(x,z)$: As I concluded earlier, this is not possible.

Hmm, let me rethink my analysis for 4. I was too quick to dismiss it. Let's reconsider:

4. $TPP(x,z)$: If $x$ is a tangential proper part of $z$, it means that $x$ is entirely contained within $z$ but touches $z$'s boundary. Given that $EC(x,y)$, $x$ also touches $y$'s boundary. For this to be consistent with $DC(y,z)$, the boundary point where $x$ touches $y$ must be different from the boundary point where $x$ touches $z$. In other words, the boundary of $x$ has two parts: one that touches $y$ and another that touches $z$. 

But wait, if $x$ is entirely contained within $z$ (as required for $TPP(x,z)$), and $x$ touches $y$, then there would be a connection between $y$ and $z$ at that point, which contradicts $DC(y,z)$. So, I still think $TPP(x,z)$ is not possible.

Actually, let me be more careful and make sure I'm thinking about this correctly.

For $EC(x,y)$:
- $x$ and $y$ touch at their boundaries.
- They don't share interior points.

For $DC(y,z)$:
- $y$ and $z$ are completely disconnected, no touching, no overlapping.

For $TPP(x,z)$:
- $x$ is entirely contained within $z$.
- $x$ touches the boundary of $z$.

So if $x$ is entirely contained within $z$ (meaning all of $x$ is in $z$) and $x$ touches $y$, then there must be a point that's both in $z$ and touches $y$. But this contradicts $DC(y,z)$, which says that $y$ and $z$ are completely disconnected.

I believe $TPP(x,z)$ is not possible in this scenario.

Let me sum up the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ given $EC(x,y)$ and $DC(y,z)$:
- $DC(x,z)$ (disconnected)
- $EC(x,z)$ (externally connected)
- $PO(x,z)$ (partially overlapping)
- $TPPi(x,z)$ (tangential proper part inverse)
- $NTPPi(x,z)$ (non-tangential proper part inverse)

The impossible relations are:
- $TPP(x,z)$ (tangential proper part)
- $NTPP(x,z)$ (non-tangential proper part)
- $EQ(x,z)$ (equal)

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused about the spatial interpretation of these relations. Let me step back and think geometrically.

If $x$ and $y$ are externally connected ($EC(x,y)$), they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

If $y$ and $z$ are disconnected ($DC(y,z)$), they don't touch or overlap at all.

Now, considering the relationship between $x$ and $z$:

1. $DC(x,z)$: $x$ and $z$ don't touch or overlap. This is possible; $x$ can be touching $y$ on one side and $z$ can be completely separate from both $x$ and $y$.

2. $EC(x,z)$: $x$ and $z$ touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible; $x$ can touch $y$ on one side and touch $z$ on another side.

3. $PO(x,z)$: $x$ and $z$ partially overlap. This is possible; the part of $x$ that overlaps with $z$ doesn't touch $y$ (since $y$ and $z$ are disconnected).

4. $TPP(x,z)$: $x$ is a tangential proper part of $z$, meaning $x$ is entirely within $z$ but touches $z$'s boundary. This means that if $x$ touches $y$ (due to $EC(x,y)$), then there's a boundary point where $x$, $y$, and $z$ all meet. But this contradicts $DC(y,z)$ because if $y$ and $z$ share a boundary point (via $x$), they are not disconnected. So, $TPP(x,z)$ is not possible.

5. $NTPP(x,z)$: $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $z$, meaning $x$ is entirely within $z$ and doesn't touch $z$'s boundary. Given that $x$ touches $y$ (due to $EC(x,y)$) and $y$ is disconnected from $z$ (due to $DC(y,z)$), if $x$ is entirely within $z$, then there would be a point that's both in $z$ and touches $y$, which contradicts $DC(y,z)$. So, $NTPP(x,z)$ is not possible.

6. $TPPi(x,z)$: $z$ is a tangential proper part of $x$, meaning $z$ is entirely within $x$ but touches $x$'s boundary. This is possible; the part of $x$ that touches $y$ can be different from the part that contains or touches $z$.

7. $NTPPi(x,z)$: $z$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$, meaning $z$ is entirely within $x$ and doesn't touch $x$'s boundary. This is possible; $z$ can be completely inside $x$, and a different part of $x$ can touch $y$.

8. $EQ(x,z)$: $x$ and $z$ are equal. If $x$ is equal to $z$, and $x$ touches $y$ (due to $EC(x,y)$), then $z$ also touches $y$, which contradicts $DC(y,z)$. So, $EQ(x,z)$ is not possible.

Actually, wait, I think I'm still not getting this right. Let me redo the analysis for $TPP(x,z)$ and $NTPP(x,z)$ cases again:

For $TPP(x,z)$:
- $x$ is a proper part of $z$ (meaning all of $x$ is inside $z$).
- $x$ touches $z$'s boundary.

If $x$ touches $y$ (due to $EC(x,y)$), and $x$ is completely inside $z$, then $y$ would be connecting with $z$ at the point where $x$ touches $y$. But this contradicts $DC(y,z)$, which states that $y$ and $z$ are disconnected.

For $NTPP(x,z)$:
- $x$ is a proper part of $z$ (meaning all of $x$ is inside $z$).
- $x$ does not touch $z$'s boundary.

The same contradiction arises: if $x$ touches $y$ and $x$ is completely inside $z$, then $y$ would be connecting with $z$ at the point where $x$ touches $y$. But this contradicts $DC(y,z)$.

Ok, let me be 100% certain by reasoning in a more formal, logical way.

From $EC(x,y)$, we know that $\exists p: p \in \text{boundary}(x) \cap \text{boundary}(y)$.

From $DC(y,z)$, we know that $\forall q: q \notin (y \cup \text{boundary}(y)) \cap (z \cup \text{boundary}(z))$.

For $TPP(x,z)$, $x$ is a proper part of $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary. Formally, $x \subset z$ and $\exists r: r \in \text{boundary}(x) \cap \text{boundary}(z)$.

Now, consider the point $p$ from $EC(x,y)$. Since $p \in \text{boundary}(x)$ and $x \subset z$ (from $TPP(x,z)$), $p$ must also be in $z$ or its boundary. If $p$ is in the interior of $z$, then since $p \in \text{boundary}(y)$, it means $y$ and $z$ are not disconnected. If $p$ is on the boundary of $z$, then again, since $p \in \text{boundary}(y)$, $y$ and $z$ are not disconnected. This contradicts $DC(y,z)$.

So, $TPP(x,z)$ is indeed not possible.

A similar contradiction arises for $NTPP(x,z)$, which also requires that $x \subset z$.

I've analyzed this in different ways and I'm now confident in my answer.

The possible relations between $x$ and $z$ given $EC(x,y)$ and $DC(y,z)$ are:
- $DC(x,z)$ (disconnected)
- $EC(x,z)$ (externally connected)
- $PO(x,z)$ (partially overlapping)
- $TPPi(x,z)$ (tangential proper part inverse)
- $NTPPi(x,z)$ (non-tangential proper part inverse)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what constraints are imposed by EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- DC(y,z): y and z are completely disconnected (no touching, no overlapping)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be touching y at the boundary while z is completely disconnected from both.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at one boundary point and touch z at a different boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z while the non-overlapping part of x touches y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary, then since x also touches y (from EC(x,y)), this would create a connection between y and z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then since x touches y, this would create a connection between y and z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be contained within x while touching x's boundary, and x can touch y at a different boundary point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, and x can touch y at its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are identical, and x touches y, then z must also touch y, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
