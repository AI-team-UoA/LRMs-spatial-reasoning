PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

I need to determine what RCC-8 relation(s) could hold between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region spatially, any relation that x has with y would be the same relation x has with z.

Given EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts, and given that y and z are exactly the same region (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x and z must also touch at their boundaries without sharing interior parts.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z would be EC(x,z).

To verify:
- EC(x,y): x touches y at boundary
- EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region
- Therefore x touches z at boundary, which is EC(x,z)

So, the answer is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. The EQ relation means that the two regions are identical - same interior, same boundary, same exterior. So if y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), and x touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), then x must also touch z at the boundary in exactly the same way.

So the answer is indeed EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z based on the given information.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they are identical spatial regions)

Since EQ(y,z) means y and z are exactly the same region (same interior, same boundary, same exterior), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if EC(x,y), then the relationship between x and z must also be EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
