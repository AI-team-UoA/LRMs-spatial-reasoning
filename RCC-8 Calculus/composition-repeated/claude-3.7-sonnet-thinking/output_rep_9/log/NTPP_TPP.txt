PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given relations:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these conditions.

First, let's think about what we know:
- x is a proper part of y (and doesn't touch y's boundary).
- y is a proper part of z (and touches z's boundary).

From this, we can infer that x is definitely a proper part of z, since parthood is transitive. So x is a proper part of z.

Now, we need to determine if x touches z's boundary or not. We have two cases to consider:

Case 1: x touches z's boundary.
If x touches z's boundary, then the relation between x and z would be TPP(x,z).

Case 2: x does not touch z's boundary.
If x does not touch z's boundary, then the relation between x and z would be NTPP(x,z).

Let's reason through these cases carefully to see if both are possible.

In the first case, for TPP(x,z) to hold, x needs to touch z's boundary. Given that y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), and x is within y without touching y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), it's possible for x to touch the same part of z's boundary that y touches. 

Wait, let me reconsider. Actually, if NTPP(x,y), then x doesn't touch y's boundary. And if TPP(y,z), then y touches z's boundary. Can x still touch z's boundary? 

Let's think of it spatially. Since x is completely within y (not touching y's boundary), and y touches z's boundary, x cannot reach z's boundary through y. So, x cannot touch z's boundary.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm second-guessing myself. Let's think about this more carefully with a clear example.

Imagine three circles:
- Circle z is the largest.
- Circle y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some point.
- Circle x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary at any point.

In this scenario:
- NTPP(x,y) holds because x is inside y without touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) holds because y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x is clearly inside z (due to transitivity of "inside").
- x doesn't touch z's boundary because it's completely within y, which is then inside z.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

This seems correct now. The only possible relationship between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) is NTPP(x,z).

Let me actually double-check with a slightly different example to be sure.

Consider:
- z is a large rectangle.
- y is a smaller rectangle inside z, with one side of y touching one side of z.
- x is a circle inside y, not touching any side of y.

In this case:
- NTPP(x,y) holds because x is inside y without touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) holds because y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

And for the relation between x and z:
- x is inside z.
- x doesn't touch z's boundary because it's completely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch z's boundary.

So again, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

This confirms my reasoning, and I'm now confident that the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I need to reconsider this once more. The reason is that I'm not sure if the scenario I described is the only possible configuration.

Let's revisit the definitions:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

From these, we know:
1. x is completely contained within y.
2. y is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Given these conditions, I'm thinking about whether it's possible for x to touch z's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary:
1. x must extend to the boundary of y (which contradicts NTPP(x,y)), and
2. that part of y's boundary must be the same as a part of z's boundary.

But if NTPP(x,y), then x is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So, x is separated from z's boundary by at least the boundary of y. Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I just realized that I might be misunderstanding the boundary touching conditions. Let me clarify with a clearer example using points and regions.

Consider a 2D space where:
- z is the entire plane.
- y is a circle within z.
- x is a smaller circle inside y.

Here:
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. But z is the entire plane, so it has no boundary. This doesn't work for our example.

Let me adjust:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a point.
- x is an even smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary.

In this case:
- NTPP(x,y) holds because x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) holds because y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x is a proper part of z (due to transitivity).
- x doesn't touch z's boundary because it doesn't touch y's boundary, and y only touches z's boundary at specific points.

So, the relation is NTPP(x,z).

But now I wonder if there are more complex geometries where other relations might hold.

For instance, could x be disconnected from z? No, because x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, so x must be a part of z.

Could x be an equal part of z? No, because x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x must be a proper part of z.

Could x externally connect to z? No, for the reasons explained earlier.

Could x partially overlap with z? No, because x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x must be a proper part of z.

Could x be a tangential proper part of z? As I reasoned earlier, this isn't possible because x doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch z's boundary.

Could z be a proper part of x? No, because y is a proper part of z, and x is a proper part of y, so z cannot be a part of x.

So, after considering all the RCC-8 relations, the only possible relation between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) is NTPP(x,z).

To be absolutely certain, let me reason through this one more time with a clear understanding of the definitions.

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is entirely contained within y).
- x does not touch the boundary of y.

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is entirely contained within z).
- y touches the boundary of z.

From these, we can infer:
- x is entirely contained within y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- y is entirely contained within z (from TPP(y,z)).
- x is entirely contained within z (by transitivity).
- x does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)).

Now, for x to touch the boundary of z, it would need to extend to the boundary of y, and that part of y's boundary would need to be on z's boundary. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary (as per NTPP(x,y)), x can't touch z's boundary.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I made an error in my reasoning above. Even if x doesn't touch y's boundary, y might have parts of its boundary that don't touch z's boundary. So, the statement "for x to touch the boundary of z, it would need to extend to the boundary of y" isn't necessarily true.

But still, since x is completely contained within y (not touching y's boundary), and y is inside z, x must be completely contained within z and not touching z's boundary. That gives us NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, I'm overthinking this, but I want to be precise. Let's use the definitions strictly. I feel like I'm making it unnecessarily complicated.

NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, from these, we have:
1. x is a proper part of y.
2. y is a proper part of z.
3. x does not touch y's boundary.
4. y touches z's boundary.

Due to the transitivity of the "proper part" relation:
5. x is a proper part of z (from 1 and 2).

Now, the question is: Does x touch z's boundary?

For x to touch z's boundary, x needs to have a point on z's boundary. Since x is completely contained within y (from 3), the only way for x to touch z's boundary is if part of y's boundary is also part of z's boundary, and x touches that part of y's boundary. But we're given that x doesn't touch y's boundary (from 3). So, x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hang on. I'm forgetting a subtlety. 

The way the RCC-8 relations are defined, they're based on the notion of "connects." Two regions x and y "connect" (C(x,y)) if they share at least one point. 

Then:
- DC(x,y): not C(x,y).
- EC(x,y): C(x,y) and the interiors of x and y don't overlap.
- PO(x,y): The interiors of x and y overlap, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(x,y): The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and x shares at least one boundary point with y.
- NTPP(x,y): The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and x doesn't share any boundary point with y.
- EQ(x,y): x and y have the same interior.
- TPPi(x,y): TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): NTPP(y,x).

Given this precise understanding:

NTPP(x,y) means:
- The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y.
- x doesn't share any boundary point with y.

TPP(y,z) means:
- The interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of z.
- y shares at least one boundary point with z.

From these, we can infer:
- The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- The interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z (by transitivity).
- x doesn't share any boundary point with y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- y shares at least one boundary point with z (from TPP(y,z)).

Now, does x share any boundary point with z?

For x to share a boundary point with z, that point must be on both the boundary of x and the boundary of z. Since x doesn't share any boundary point with y, any boundary point of x is strictly inside the interior of y. And since y is a proper subset of z, any point inside the interior of y is inside the interior of z, not on its boundary.

Therefore, x doesn't share any boundary point with z, which means NTPP(x,z).

So, the final answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I want to revisit this once more because I'm confusing myself with the boundaries.

Let me go back to the basic definitions of the RCC-8 relations. I'm using the original definitions by Randell, Cui, and Cohn.

The RCC-8 relations are based on the notion of connection (C). Two regions x and y are connected (C(x,y)) if and only if their closures share a common point.

From this, the other relations are defined:

DC(x,y) (disconnected): not C(x,y).
EC(x,y) (externally connected): C(x,y) and not O(x,y).
PO(x,y) (partially overlapping): O(x,y) and not P(x,y) and not P(y,x).
TPP(x,y) (tangential proper part): P(x,y) and not P(y,x) and C(x, complement of y).
NTPP(x,y) (non-tangential proper part): P(x,y) and not P(y,x) and not C(x, complement of y).
EQ(x,y) (equal): P(x,y) and P(y,x).
TPPi(x,y) (inverse of TPP): TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y) (inverse of NTPP): NTPP(y,x).

Here, O(x,y) means "x overlaps y", which is true if they share a point with a neighborhood that's in both x and y. P(x,y) means "x is a part of y", which is true if every point of x is also in y.

Now, given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), let's determine the relation between x and z.

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a part of y (P(x,y)).
- y is not a part of x (not P(y,x)).
- x does not connect with the complement of y (not C(x, complement of y)).

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a part of z (P(y,z)).
- z is not a part of y (not P(z,y)).
- y connects with the complement of z (C(y, complement of z)).

From these, we can infer:
- x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, so x is a part of z (P(x,z)).
- z is not a part of y, and y is not a part of x, so z is not a part of x (not P(z,x)).

So, x is a proper part of z (P(x,z) and not P(z,x)).

Now, we need to determine if x connects with the complement of z (C(x, complement of z)).

For x to connect with the complement of z, x and the complement of z must share a common point. Given that:
- x does not connect with the complement of y (not C(x, complement of y)).
- y connects with the complement of z (C(y, complement of z)).

Since x is a part of y, the only way for x to connect with the complement of z is if a part of the boundary of y that's also the boundary of x is outside of z. But we know that x doesn't connect with the complement of y, which means x doesn't touch the boundary of y. So, x can't connect with the complement of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me reason through it more straightforwardly.

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we know:
- x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

From these, we can infer:
- x is a proper part of z (because x is part of y, and y is part of z).
- x doesn't touch z's boundary (because x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is a proper part of z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Ah, I realize the issue in my reasoning. It's about the "touching the boundary" part. Let me clarify:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This means x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This means y is inside z, with at least one point of y touching z's boundary.

Given these, can x touch z's boundary? No, because x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary. And y, while it touches z's boundary, is still a proper part of z. So, x, being inside y, is also completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to consider some simpler cases to make sure my understanding is correct.

Let's suppose we have three 2D regions: x, y, and z. x is a circle, y is a slightly larger circle that contains x, and z is an even larger circle that contains y. The center of all three circles is the same.

In this case:
- x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y).
- y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(y,z).

Given these, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z), which seems reasonable.

Now, let's modify the example. Let x and y be as before, but now y touches the boundary of z.

In this case:
- x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y).
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(y,z).

Given these, what's the relation between x and z? x is still completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so the relation is NTPP(x,z).

I think this confirms my understanding. The relation between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) is NTPP(x,z).

But just to make absolutely sure, let me try one more example with a slightly different configuration.

Let's imagine a region z, which is a large square. Inside z, we have a region y, which is a smaller square positioned such that one side of y is flush with one side of z. Inside y, we have a region x, which is a circle positioned such that it's completely inside y and doesn't touch any side of y.

In this case:
- x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y).
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(y,z).

Given these, what's the relation between x and z? x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so the relation is NTPP(x,z).

This confirms my understanding once more. So, the answer is: 

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me double-check whether x could touch z's boundary.

Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. And given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary, x would need to touch a part of y that's on z's boundary. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary at all (from NTPP(x,y)), and y only touches z's boundary at some points (from TPP(y,z)), x can't touch z's boundary.

So again, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I really am overthinking this. The answer is simply NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me analyze what we know:
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

From these relations, I can determine:
1. x is part of y (from NTPP(x,y))
2. y is part of z (from TPP(y,z))
3. Therefore, x is part of z (by transitivity of the part-of relation)

Now I need to determine if x touches z's boundary:
- Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y))
- And y only touches z's boundary at certain points (from TPP(y,z))
- x cannot reach z's boundary because it's completely contained within y without touching y's boundary

Therefore, x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary, which means:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
