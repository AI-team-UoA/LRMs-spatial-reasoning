PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step-by-step:

We know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about what EC(x,y) tells us: x and y touch only at their boundaries. They don't overlap in their interiors.

And NTPPi(y,z) tells us that z is a proper part of y, and z is fully contained in the interior of y, not touching y's boundary.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is fully contained in the interior of y, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot share any points. They must be disconnected.

So, x and z must be in the DC (disconnected) relation.

Let's double-check this reasoning: 
- x only touches y at the boundary (EC)
- z is entirely in the interior of y, away from the boundary (NTPP)
- Therefore, x and z cannot have any points in common, which means they are disconnected (DC)

So, the relationship between x and z is DC.

Actually, wait. Let me be careful here. I need to consider all possibilities.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
NTPPi(y,z) means z contains y completely in its interior, with y not touching the boundary of z.

So, y is properly inside z, and x touches y at the boundary. What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

If y is properly inside z, and x touches the boundary of y, then x might also intersect with z. In fact, since y is properly inside z, and x touches y, x must also intersect with z. But the nature of that intersection depends on how x and z are positioned.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But this is impossible because x touches y, and y is inside z, so x must at least touch z.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if x touches the boundary of z at the same point where it touches the boundary of y.

No, that's still wrong. If y is properly inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, then x must be inside z to some extent.

Let's revisit:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Since y is entirely within the interior of z (away from z's boundary), and x touches the boundary of y, x must penetrate the interior of z to some extent. This could be in several ways:

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some regions.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely within z but touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the interior of z, not touching z's boundary.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me reconsider the constraints carefully.

EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y. z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, we have z inside y, and x touching y's boundary. Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. This means x and z are disconnected.

So, the relationship between x and z is DC.

Actually, I think my first answer was correct. Let me reason it through one more time to be sure:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. Therefore, x and z are disconnected (DC).

Actually, I think I'm confused because I misinterpreted NTPPi(y,z). Let me correct this:

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which is z is a non-tangential proper part of y. But that's not right either...

NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That means y is fully contained in the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

Now, with this understanding:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is fully contained in the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is inside z, and x touches y's boundary, x must at least touch or overlap with z. The possible relationships could be:

1. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x touches z's boundary but doesn't penetrate its interior.

2. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends into the interior of z to touch y, but also extends outside of z.

3. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z but touches z's boundary.

4. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the interior of z, not touching z's boundary.

I think 1 and 4 are wrong. Let's examine.

For EC(x,z), if x only touches z's boundary, it wouldn't be able to touch y's boundary since y is in the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), if x is entirely in the interior of z away from z's boundary, it might not be able to touch y's boundary, depending on how y is positioned inside z.

Actually, I think I need to be even more careful. Let me reconsider:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is fully contained in the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

If y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, then x must be inside z to some extent, or at least overlap with z. But x doesn't have to be completely inside z.

The possible relationships between x and z could be:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x penetrates z's interior to touch y's boundary, but also extends outside of z.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the interior of z, not touching z's boundary.

I'm not sure about EC(x,z) because if x only touches z's boundary, it wouldn't be able to touch y's boundary, since y is in the interior of z away from z's boundary.

Let me double check my understanding. I still suspect I may be incorrectly reasoning through this. Let's try a simple example.

Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a small circle touching y's boundary but otherwise outside of y. If x is small enough, it could be entirely inside z, which would make it TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z). If x is larger, it might extend beyond z, which would make it PO(x,z).

But can x be outside of z entirely, making it DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)? If y is inside z away from z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then x must at least penetrate z's interior. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

But what about EC(x,z)? Can x touch the boundary of z while also touching the boundary of y, which is inside z away from z's boundary? I don't think so, because if y is inside z away from z's boundary, then x must penetrate z's interior to touch y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is also impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Ah, I've been conflating the definition of the NTPPi relation. Let me clarify:

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Given the corrected understanding:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. Therefore, x and z are disconnected (DC).

Hmm, I'm still confused. Let me re-read the question and the definitions to ensure I'm understanding correctly.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Given these, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's reason step by step:

If z is a proper part of y, not touching y's boundary, and x touches y only at the boundary, then x and z don't share any points. This is because z is in the interior of y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary.

Therefore, x and z are disconnected (DC).

Actually, that's not quite right. Let me clarify the NTPPi relation again:

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a proper part of y, not touching y's boundary.

So, z is contained entirely within the interior of y, away from y's boundary. And x touches y only at the boundary.

Since z is in the interior of y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z are disconnected (DC).

Let me recheck the definition of NTPPi.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z).

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is contained entirely within the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is contained entirely within the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Wait, that's not right. I'm getting confused with the notation.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z).

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means that y is contained entirely within z, away from the boundary of z. In other words, y is properly inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Given this:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is properly inside z, and x touches y's boundary, x must also interact with z. The exact relationship depends on how x and z are positioned.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some regions.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z but touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the interior of z, not touching z's boundary.

4. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This could be possible if x touches z's boundary but doesn't penetrate its interior, but given that y is properly inside z, and x touches y, I'm not sure if this configuration is valid.

Let me try to determine if EC(x,z) is valid.

If y is properly inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, then x must penetrate z's interior to at least touch y's boundary. If x only touches z's boundary, it can't touch y's boundary since y is away from z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not valid.

What about DC(x,z)? If x and z are disconnected, then x can't touch y's boundary since y is properly inside z. So, DC(x,z) is also not valid.

The relationships TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are also not valid because they would imply that z is a proper part of x, which doesn't make sense given that y is properly inside z and x touches y's boundary.

Similarly, EQ(x,z) is not valid because it would imply that x and z are the same, which doesn't align with the constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think this through once more. I think NTPP(x,z) might not be valid.

If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely within the interior of z, away from z's boundary. But x also touches y's boundary. If y is properly inside z, and x is also entirely inside z, then there's a configuration where x doesn't touch y's boundary (if x is in a region of z away from y). But given that EC(x,y), x must touch y's boundary.

So, can NTPP(x,z) be valid? Yes, it can be. If x is entirely within the interior of z, and y is also within the interior of z, x can touch y's boundary while still being away from z's boundary.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Ugh, let me try again carefully. I think I was conflating the definition of NTPPi.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z, not touching z's boundary, and the inverse of y and z.

Wait, that's not right.

Let me clarify:

- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means that z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Given this:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Now, since z is in the interior of y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. Therefore, x and z are disconnected (DC).

I think that's the correct answer: DC(x,z).

Actually, let me triple check the definition of NTPPi again. It's easy to confuse the "Non-Tangential Proper Part inverse" relationship.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is properly inside y, away from y's boundary.

With this understanding:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is properly inside y, away from y's boundary.

Since z is in the interior of y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. Therefore, x and z are disconnected (DC).

So, the relationship between x and z is DC.

Actually, I think I was right the third time. Let me clarify:

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is properly inside y, away from y's boundary.

So if z is inside y, y is outside z. If x is external to y (only touching at boundary), then x must be external to z, specifically, disconnected from z (since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary).

So, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me once more clearly understand NTPPi.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z).

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is contained entirely within the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is contained entirely within the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

With this understanding:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is contained entirely within the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Since z is in the interior of y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. Therefore, x and z are disconnected (DC).

Actually, I think I was right the last time. Let me try to be crystal clear and break it down step by step:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
2. NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained entirely within the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Now, since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z can't have any points in common. They are disconnected.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me double check using RCC-8 composition table, if I can infer a direct result.

The RCC-8 composition table gives the possible relations for (x,z) given the relations (x,y) and (y,z).

For EC(x,y) composed with NTPPi(y,z), the result is DC(x,z).

This confirms my reasoning. The relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let's make sure by visualizing this. Consider a circle y, with another circle z inside y, away from y's boundary. Now, consider a circle x that touches y's boundary. It's clear that x and z don't share any points; they are disconnected.

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, the composition table might not have the exact entry we're looking for, since it's usually presented in terms of the relation between (x,z) given the relations (x,y) and (y,z). But in our case, we have (x,y) and (y,z), and we want (x,z).

But the reasoning is sound. If z is entirely inside y away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, then x and z are disconnected.

Therefore, the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me visualize this using different shapes to ensure clarity:

Imagine y as a large square, z as a smaller square inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that touches y's boundary at a point but is otherwise outside of y. It's clear that x and z don't share any points; they are disconnected.

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, I think I misunderstood the problem from the start. Let me ensure clarity.

We're given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is contained entirely within the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

And we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given these, y is properly inside z, and x touches y's boundary. The relationship between x and z depends on how x extends (or doesn't extend) into or outside of z.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends into the interior of z to touch y's boundary, but also extends outside of z.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the interior of z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

I don't think EC(x,z) or DC(x,z) are possible, because x must at least touch or overlap with z to touch y's boundary, given that y is inside z.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me visualize this:

Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle fully inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as another shape touching y's boundary:

1. If x is a circle entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching y's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

2. If x is a circle entirely inside z, touching both y's boundary and z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).

3. If x is a shape that touches y's boundary but also extends beyond z's boundary, then PO(x,z).

Given these considerations, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think my confusion stemmed from misinterpreting NTPPi. Let me be crystal clear:

NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is contained entirely within the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

Given this:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, away from z's boundary.

Now, since y is inside z and x touches y's boundary, x must at least touch or overlap with z. The possible relationships could be:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends outside of z while also touching y's boundary.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the interior of z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Other relationships (DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) aren't possible given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm just going to assume that NTPPi(y,z) means "y is a non-tangential proper part of z".

Given that:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, away from z's boundary.

Since y is inside z and x touches y's boundary, x must at least touch or overlap with z. The possible relationships are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends outside of z while also touching y's boundary.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the interior of z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, so to check if I'm understanding these relations correctly:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

In the question, we're given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, z is inside y, away from y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary. Since z is away from y's boundary and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. They are disconnected.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Okay, so my interpretation might not be correct. Let me double check the definition of NTPPi in the context of RCC-8.

In RCC-8, NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is properly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given this:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is properly inside z, away from z's boundary.

Now, let's reason through this step by step:

If y is properly inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, then x must at least intersect with z to touch y's boundary. The possible relationships could be:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends outside of z while also touching y's boundary.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within the interior of z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Other relationships (DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) aren't possible given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I might be mixing up the definition of NTPPi. Let me consult the original definition from the RCC-8 calculus.

In RCC-8:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is properly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), i.e., NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which is y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Given this correct understanding:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. They are disconnected.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me ensure I'm understanding the notation correctly. In the context of RCC-8:

- NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse relation of NTPP(y,z).
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is properly inside z, away from z's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is properly inside y, away from y's boundary.

Given this:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is properly inside y, away from y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. They are disconnected.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Okay, I think my confusion was mainly due to inconsistently interpreting NTPPi. The correct interpretation is:

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

With this understanding:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is fully contained in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x and z don't share any points. They are disconnected.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me triple check by visualizing this: Imagine y as a circle, z as a smaller circle fully inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a shape that touches y's boundary. It's clear that x and z don't share any points; they are disconnected.

The answer is DC(x,z).

Let me very carefully walk through all the cases and possibilities:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries, but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

We want to find all possible relations between x and z.

First, let's visualize this: y contains z (away from its boundary), and x touches y's boundary. If x only touches y's boundary, and z is away from y's boundary, then x and z can't intersect. They're disconnected.

So, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I'm just going to double check this by referencing the actual RCC-8 composition table. According to the composition table for RCC-8:

For EC(x,y) composed with NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationship for (x,z) is DC(x,z).

This confirms our reasoning. The answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, let's think of some examples to double check:

Example 1: Imagine y as a big circle on a 2D plane, z as a smaller circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x as a circle outside y that touches y's boundary at a single point. In this case, x and z are clearly disconnected, so DC(x,z).

I can't think of a counter-example where x and z would have a relationship other than DC. So, our answer DC(x,z) seems correct.

Actually, let me double check my work by reasoning from first principles:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries, but don't overlap.
NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

If z is inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary (not overlapping with y), then x and z can't have any points in common. They are disconnected.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me understand what these relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Now I can reason about x and z:
- Since z is completely inside y (away from y's boundary)
- And x only touches y at the boundary (without sharing interior parts)
- Then x and z cannot share any points

Since x and z have no points in common, they must be disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
