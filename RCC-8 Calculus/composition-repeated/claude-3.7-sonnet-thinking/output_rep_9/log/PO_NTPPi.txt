PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step-by-step. We have the following information:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap - they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y - so z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let me think about this spatially.

Given that:
- y and x partially overlap (they share some region)
- z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)

The possible relationships between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be disconnected, if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could externally connect (touch at the boundary), if z reaches to a part of y's interior that touches the boundary of the x-y overlap.
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap, if z extends into the region where x and y overlap.
4. TPP(z,x): z could be a tangential proper part of x, if z is inside x and touches x's boundary (but this boundary would have to be inside y, since z doesn't touch y's boundary).
5. NTPP(z,x): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, if z is completely inside the region where x and y overlap.
6. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z, if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
7. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, if x is completely inside z.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal, if the region of x overlapping with y exactly matches z.

Let me analyze each of these possibilities more carefully to determine which ones are actually possible.

Let's first clarify the conditions:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some region, but neither is contained in the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Since NTPPi(y,z) means z is completely inside y, and PO(x,y) means x partially overlaps with y, let's examine each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, that means they don't share any points. Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, this is possible if the part of y that contains z doesn't overlap with x. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary (because NTPPi(y,z)), and x overlaps with y, the only way for x and z to externally connect would be if the boundary of x passes through the interior of y in such a way that it just touches z's boundary. This is possible, so EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since z is inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible for x and z to partially overlap if x extends into z but also outside of z (still within y or outside y). So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, this is possible if x contains z and z touches x's boundary (which would be inside y). So TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary). Since z is inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, this is possible if the region of overlap between x and y completely contains z. So NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). However, this contradicts PO(x,y) because if x is inside z, and z is inside y, then x must be inside y, which contradicts partial overlap. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary). Again, this contradicts PO(x,y) for the same reason as above. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. If x and z are identical, and z is completely inside y, then x would also be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check these conclusions:

For TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z):
- If any of these were true, then x would be contained in z.
- Since NTPPi(y,z) means z is contained in y, transitivity would imply that x is contained in y.
- But PO(x,y) explicitly states that x is not contained in y.
- Therefore, TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Actually, let me draw a diagram on paper to verify these conclusions... 

Wait, I need to carefully think about TPP(z,x) again. If TPP(z,x), then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since z is completely inside y (due to NTPPi(y,z)), z doesn't touch y's boundary. So if z touches x's boundary, that boundary point must be strictly inside y. Is this possible while maintaining PO(x,y)? 

Yes, it's possible. If x partially overlaps with y, there's a part of x inside y and a part outside. The part of x's boundary that's inside y could be touching z, while z remains completely inside y. So TPP(z,x) is possible.

Similarly, NTPP(z,x) means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also compatible with the given conditions, as z can be completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y.

Let me reconfirm each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
2. EC(x,z): Possible if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y, but doesn't extend outside that region.
3. PO(x,z): Possible if z extends into the overlapping region between x and y, but also covers some part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
4. TPP(z,x): Possible if z is completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and touches the boundary of this overlapping region (but not y's boundary).
5. NTPP(z,x): Possible if z is completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and doesn't touch the boundary of this overlapping region.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Actually, I need to be careful about TPP(z,x). TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z touches x's boundary. However, since z is strictly inside y (doesn't touch y's boundary due to NTPPi(y,z)), z can only touch the part of x's boundary that's inside y. This is still compatible with PO(x,y), so TPP(z,x) is possible.

OK, so the final list of possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Hmm, actually let me make sure EC(x,z) is really possible. EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since z is completely inside y (due to NTPPi(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y, the only way for x and z to externally connect would be if the boundary of x passes through the interior of y in such a way that it just touches z's boundary.

Let's see... if z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x overlaps partially with y, can the boundary of x touch the boundary of z without x and z sharing any interior points? I think this is possible. The boundary of x can pass through the interior of y, and this boundary can touch z's boundary without x and z sharing interior points.

So EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me double-check all of these again. We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (or y is a non-tangential proper inverse of z).

Given these conditions, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): Possible if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
- EC(x,z): Possible if the boundary of x passes through the interior of y and touches z's boundary.
- PO(x,z): Possible if z extends into the overlapping region between x and y, but also covers some part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
- TPP(z,x): Possible if z is completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and touches the boundary of this overlapping region (but not y's boundary).
- NTPP(z,x): Possible if z is completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and doesn't touch the boundary of this overlapping region.

Actually, I need to be a bit more careful. Let's analyze TPP(z,x) more closely:

TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x, which means:
1. z is a proper part of x (z is inside x).
2. z touches x's boundary.

Now, NTPPi(y,z) means z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary. If z is touching x's boundary, where could this boundary be? It has to be inside y, since z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Is this scenario compatible with PO(x,y)? PO(x,y) means x and y share some region, but neither is contained in the other. If the boundary of x is inside y, does that mean x is contained in y? No, not necessarily. The boundary of x can partially be inside y and partially outside y. So TPP(z,x) is compatible with the given conditions.

Let's use a concrete example: Imagine y is a big circle, and z is a smaller circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary). Now, imagine x is a shape that partially overlaps with y, such that it contains z completely, and the boundary of x that z touches is inside y. This satisfies all the conditions.

So, the final list of possible relationships between x and z is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Let me triple-check one last time:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if the boundary of x passes through the interior of y and touches z's boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z extends into the overlapping region between x and y, but also covers some part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and touches the boundary of x somewhere inside y.
5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So the answer is DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I should double-check the details again. TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) (i.e. TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x)) have to be possible because it's possible that the region where x and y overlap contains z.

So, the complete list of possible relationships between x and z is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Actually, upon further reflection, I think I need to be a bit more careful about EC(x,z). EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary due to NTPPi(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y, can the boundary of x pass through the interior of y in such a way that it just touches z's boundary?

I think this is indeed possible. The boundary of x can pass through the interior of y, and this boundary can touch z's boundary without x and z sharing interior points. So EC(x,z) is possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some region, but neither is contained in the other)
- NTPPi(y,z): which means NTPP(z,y) - z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Possible if the boundary of x passes through y's interior and just touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if z partially extends into the overlapping region of x and y.

4. TPP(z,x): Possible if z is completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, and z touches x's boundary (which would be inside y).

5. NTPP(z,x): Possible if z is completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, not touching x's boundary.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because they would require x to be contained in z, which would mean x is contained in y (since z is contained in y), contradicting the PO(x,y) relation.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)
