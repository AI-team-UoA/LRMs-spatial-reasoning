PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we know and then determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): This means y and z are coincident or equal.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are the same region. This means any relation that holds between y and another region also holds between z and that region.

Since TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), y is a tangential proper part of x. Since y and z are the same (EQ(y,z)), z is also a tangential proper part of x.

So, TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

Let's double-check by considering the definitions of the RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,z): Disconnected. This can't be the case because z is the same as y, and y is a part of x, so z must also be a part of x.
- EC(x,z): Externally connected. This can't be the case for the same reason; z must be a part of x.
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. This also can't be the case because z is the same as y, and y is a proper part of x, not just partially overlapping.
- TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part. This would mean x is a proper part of z. But since z is the same as y, and y is a proper part of x, this can't be the case.
- TPPi(x,z): Inverse of tangential proper part. This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Since z is the same as y, and y is a tangential proper part of x, this is the correct relation.
- NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part. This would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this can't be the case.
- NTPPi(x,z): Inverse of non-tangential proper part. This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But since z is the same as y, and y is a tangential proper part of x (touches x's boundary), this can't be the case.
- EQ(x,z): Equal. This would mean x and z are the same. But since z is the same as y, and y is a proper part of x (not the same as x), this can't be the case.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z), which means TPP(z,x).

Wait, I need to be more careful with the reasoning here.

From TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

From EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are the same spatial region.

Given these two facts, we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since y and z are the same (EQ(y,z)), and y is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(y,x)), it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x, which can be written as TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

But I think I should be more careful and consider the formal definitions and rules for RCC-8 relations.

In RCC-8, given EQ(y,z), and any relationship R(x,y), the same relationship should hold between x and z, i.e., R(x,z). This is because y and z are the same region in space.

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), and EQ(y,z), we can say TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Let me check this:

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x (y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary).
If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same spatial region.

Given these, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since y and z are the same, and y is a tangential proper part of x, z is also a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me approach this more systematically.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, x is the inverse of a tangential proper part of y.
- EQ(y,z): This means y and z are coincident or equal.

First, let's understand what EQ(y,z) means in terms of reasoning. When two regions are equal, they can be used interchangeably in any spatial relation. This means if we have a relation R(a,b) and EQ(b,c), then R(a,c) holds as well. This is due to the principle of substitution, where equals can be substituted for equals.

In our case, we have TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z). Using the principle of substitution, we can substitute z for y in the first relation, which gives us TPPi(x,z).

Let's verify this by considering the definitions again:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same.

Given these two, z must also be a tangential proper part of x, which means TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

So the answer is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of TPPi(x,y). 

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y). TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. So, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. 

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y.
- x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

Given TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we can say:
- y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- y and z are the same (from EQ(y,z)).

From these, we can conclude:
- z is a proper part of x (since z is the same as y, and y is a proper part of x).
- z touches the boundary of x (since z is the same as y, and y touches the boundary of x).

These conditions satisfy the definition of TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

OK so the answer is
TPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the given relations TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a tangential proper part of x
- y is contained in x and touches x's boundary

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- y and z are interchangeable in any spatial relation

When two regions are equal (EQ), we can substitute one for the other in any relation while preserving the truth of that relation.

Since y and z are equal, and y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), it follows that z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, TPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).
