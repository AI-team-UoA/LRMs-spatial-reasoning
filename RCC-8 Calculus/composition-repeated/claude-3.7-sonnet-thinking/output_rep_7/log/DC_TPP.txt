PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We need to find all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's break down what we know:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now I need to analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z. I'll consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with the given information.

First, let's visualize this situation:
- x is disconnected from y
- y is a tangential proper part of z (inside z, touching z's boundary)

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible for x to be disconnected from z?
   If y is inside z and x is disconnected from y, then x could be completely outside of z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible for x to externally connect to z?
   If y is inside z (touching z's boundary) and x is disconnected from y, then x could touch z's boundary without touching y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible for x to partially overlap z?
   If y is inside z and x is disconnected from y, then x could overlap with parts of z without touching y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z?
   If y is inside z and x is disconnected from y, then x could be inside z (touching z's boundary) in a different region than y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   If y is inside z and x is disconnected from y, then x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary and without touching y. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x?
   If y is inside z, and z is inside x (touching x's boundary), then y would also have to be inside x. But we know DC(x,y), which means y is disconnected from x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to the above, if z is inside x, then y would also have to be inside x. But we know DC(x,y), which means y is disconnected from x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible for x to be equal to z?
   If x equals z and y is inside z, then y would be inside x. But we know DC(x,y), which means y is disconnected from x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check the reasoning for 6, 7, and 8:

For TPPi(x,z), this would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Since TPP(y,z), y is inside z. If z is inside x, then y must also be inside x. But DC(x,y) says x and y are disconnected, which contradicts y being inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), this would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The reasoning is similar to TPPi. If z is inside x, then y must also be inside x (since y is inside z). But DC(x,y) says x and y are disconnected, which contradicts y being inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), this would mean x and z are identical. Since TPP(y,z), y is inside z. If x equals z, then y would be inside x. But DC(x,y) says x and y are disconnected, which contradicts y being inside x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me verify these conclusions once more:

DC(x,z): x could be completely outside of z, separate from both z and y.
EC(x,z): x could touch the boundary of z without overlapping with y.
PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z in regions where y is not present.
TPP(x,z): x could be inside z, touching z's boundary, but in a separate region from y.
NTPP(x,z): x could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and still separate from y.

These all seem consistent with the given constraints that DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Wait, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z) and TPP(x,z) more carefully. I need to ensure that these are consistent with DC(x,y).

For TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. We also know that y is inside z and touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)). For x and y to be disconnected (DC(x,y)), they must be in separate regions of z without touching. This seems possible as long as z is large enough to contain both x and y with some space between them.

For NTPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, as long as x and y don't touch inside z, this is consistent with DC(x,y).

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no spatial parts)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be completely outside z while y is inside z
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can touch z's boundary without touching y inside z
3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap z without intersecting y
4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be inside z touching z's boundary in a region separate from y
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z (not touching boundary) while still separate from y
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible - if z were inside x, then y would also have to be inside x (contradicting DC(x,y))
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - same reasoning as TPPi
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x=z and y is inside z, then y would be inside x (contradicting DC(x,y))

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
