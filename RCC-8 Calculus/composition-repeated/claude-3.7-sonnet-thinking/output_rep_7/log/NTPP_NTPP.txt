PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we know:
1. NTPP(x, y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y, z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Given these two relations, we need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z.

Since x is entirely contained within y, and y is entirely contained within z, it follows that x is also entirely contained within z. This is a transitivity property.

Now, I need to determine if x touches the boundary of z or not.

Since x does not touch the boundary of y (because NTPP(x, y)), and y does not touch the boundary of z (because NTPP(y, z)), it follows that x cannot touch the boundary of z.

This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x, z).

Let me verify this by considering other possible relations:

- DC(x, z)? No, this means x and z are disconnected, but we know x is contained within z.
- EC(x, z)? No, this means x and z touch at a boundary, but x is strictly inside z.
- PO(x, z)? No, this means x and z overlap but neither is contained in the other, but x is contained within z.
- TPP(x, z)? No, this means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary.
- NTPP(x, z)? Yes, x is contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x, z)? No, this means z is a tangential proper part of x, which is impossible given the initial relations.
- NTPPi(x, z)? No, this means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is impossible given the initial relations.
- EQ(x, z)? No, this means x and z are coincident, which is impossible given the initial relations.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x, z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning about TPP(x, z). I said that x cannot touch z's boundary because x doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary. This reasoning is correct: if x is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside z, then x must also be strictly inside z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x, z).

Actually, now I realized I should be more systematic. Let's consider the formal definition of NTPP.

NTPP(x, y) means that x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is a part of y but y is not a part of x) and x does not share any boundary points with y.

Now, given NTPP(x, y) and NTPP(y, z), I want to establish what relation holds between x and z.

First, since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, by the transitivity of the "part of" relation, x is a part of z.

Next, I need to determine if x shares any boundary points with z. Since x does not share any boundary points with y (from NTPP(x, y)), and y does not share any boundary points with z (from NTPP(y, z)), it follows that x does not share any boundary points with z.

So, x is a proper part of z and does not share any boundary points with z, which is exactly the definition of NTPP(x, z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x, z).

Ah, I see that I've been overthinking this. Let me approach this more directly.

Given:
- NTPP(x, y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's visualize this: x is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside z. Clearly, x is also strictly inside z.

This means NTPP(x, z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x, z).

Hmm, actually, let me double-check if NTPP is transitive.

NTPP(x, y) means x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
NTPP(y, z) means y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary.

If we visualize it, x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary. It follows that x is inside z without touching z's boundary.

So, NTPP is indeed transitive, and NTPP(x, z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

Actually, I was correct in my original analysis. Let me be entirely sure. Given NTPP(x, y) and NTPP(y, z), I want to determine the possible relation(s) between x and z.

NTPP(x, y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In the RCC-8 calculus, this means that x is a proper part of y (x is contained within y) and x is surrounded by y (i.e., x does not touch the boundary of y).

Similarly, NTPP(y, z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Given these two relations, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

First, we know that x is contained within y, and y is contained within z. By transitivity, x is contained within z. So, x is a proper part of z.

Next, we need to determine if x touches the boundary of z. Since x is surrounded by y (from NTPP(x, y)), and y is surrounded by z (from NTPP(y, z)), it follows that x is surrounded by z. In other words, x does not touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which is NTPP(x, z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x, z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what the composition of NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) tells us about the possible relationship between x and z.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary

Since x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must be:
1. Completely inside z (because x is inside y which is inside z)
2. Cannot touch z's boundary (because x doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary)

This situation precisely matches the definition of NTPP(x,z).

I can verify this is the only possible relation by checking each RCC-8 relation:
- DC, EC: Impossible as x must be inside z
- PO: Impossible as x must be completely inside z
- TPP: Impossible as x cannot touch z's boundary
- NTPP: âœ“ (x is inside z without touching its boundary)
- TPPi, NTPPi: Impossible as z cannot be inside x
- EQ: Impossible as x is strictly smaller than z

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
