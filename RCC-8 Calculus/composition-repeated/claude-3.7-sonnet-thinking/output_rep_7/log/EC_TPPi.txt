PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's figure out what we know:

1. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now I need to determine what relationship could hold between x and z given these two facts.

Let me think about what EC(x,y) means spatially. It means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. They share boundary points but no interior points.

And TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y, and z touches the boundary of y. So z is contained in y, and at least part of z touches the boundary of y.

So what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Well, z is inside y and touches y's boundary. x is outside y but touches y's boundary. 

There are several possibilities:
1. x and z might touch at the boundary of y, in which case EC(x,z) would hold.
2. x and z might be completely separate, not touching at all, in which case DC(x,z) would hold.

Let me think more carefully. Since z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), z touches the boundary of y. But that doesn't mean z touches all of the boundary of y. It could touch some part of the boundary that x doesn't touch. In that case, x and z would be disconnected (DC).

On the other hand, if z touches a part of the boundary of y that x also touches, then x and z would be externally connected (EC).

So the possible relationships are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.

Let me double-check if there are any other possibilities.

Could x and z overlap (PO)? No, because z is entirely within y, and x is entirely outside y except for possibly boundary points. So x and z cannot share any interior points, which means they cannot partially overlap.

Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))? No, because x is outside y except for boundary points, while z is inside y. So x cannot be inside z.

Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))? No, for the same reason as above.

Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x))? No, because z is inside y, while x is outside y except for boundary points. So z cannot be inside x.

Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x))? No, for the same reason as above.

Could x and z be equal (EQ(x,z))? No, because z is inside y, while x is outside y except for boundary points. So x and z cannot be equal.

So the only possible relations between x and z are DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected).

Actually, let me make sure I understand these constraints properly. In RCC-8:

- DC(x,y): x and y have no common points.
- EC(x,y): x and y have common boundary points but no common interior points.
- PO(x,y): x and y have common interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not share boundary points with y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and shares boundary points with x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not share boundary points with x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.

Given EC(x,y), x and y have common boundary points but no common interior points.
Given TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y), z is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y.

So z is inside y and touches y's boundary. x is outside y but touches y's boundary. 

There are two cases:
1. If x and z touch the same part of y's boundary, then EC(x,z) holds.
2. If x and z touch different parts of y's boundary, then DC(x,z) holds.

So the answer is: DC or EC.

Actually, let me think about this one more time. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y have common boundary points but no common interior points.
- TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y.

So x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

The relationship between x and z depends on whether they touch the same part of y's boundary:
1. If they do, then EC(x,z) holds.
2. If they don't, then DC(x,z) holds.

Actually, I think I need to consider one more possibility. Could x and z partially overlap (PO)? No, because z is entirely within y, and x is entirely outside y except for possibly boundary points. So x and z cannot share any interior points, which means they cannot partially overlap.

So the only possible relations between x and z are DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected).

Actually, wait. Let me visualize this to make sure:

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. 
TPPi(y,z) means that z contains y, and y touches z's boundary.

Wait, I may have been thinking about this wrong. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. So y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So the situation is:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

In other words, x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

OK so the question is now: what's the relationship between x and z?

If y is a tangential proper part of z (TPPi(y,z)), then z extends beyond y. Since x touches y at the boundary, x could also touch z, or x could be partially inside z, or x could be completely inside z. Let's consider these:

1. If x touches z at the boundary but doesn't overlap with z, then EC(x,z) holds.
2. If x partially overlaps with z, then PO(x,z) holds.
3. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then TPP(x,z) holds.
4. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

I think these are all the possibilities.

Actually, wait. I think I've been interpreting TPPi incorrectly. Let me review the definitions:

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y.
- TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP, so y is a proper part of x and shares boundary points with x.

Given TPPi(y,z), this means that z is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y.

So the situation is:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Alright, so x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y and touches y's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary but is outside y, the relationship between x and z depends on whether they touch the same part of y's boundary:
1. If they do, then EC(x,z) holds.
2. If they don't, then DC(x,z) holds.

So the answer is: DC or EC.

Ah, but let me make sure we're right about the interpretation of TPPi. In the RCC-8 calculus, TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. 

Let me clarify the definitions:

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

Given TPPi(y,z), this means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. So y properly contains z, and z touches the boundary of y.

Now our scenario is:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, and z touches the boundary of y.

So x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

The relationship between x and z depends on whether they touch the same part of y's boundary:
1. If they do, then EC(x,z) holds.
2. If they don't, then DC(x,z) holds.

So the answer is: DC or EC.

Actually, wait, I don't think I'm being clear about the definition of TPPi. Let me review it one more time:

If TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y, then TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and shares boundary points with x. In other words, TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x).

So TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y.

So our scenario is:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y.

So x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

The relationship between x and z depends on whether they touch the same part of y's boundary:
1. If they touch the same part of y's boundary, then EC(x,z) holds.
2. If they touch different parts of y's boundary, then DC(x,z) holds.

So the answer is: DC or EC.

Hmm, I keep getting confused about whether TPPi(y,z) means y is part of z or z is part of y. Let me think about it in another way:

If TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, then TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of this, meaning that y is a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x).

Given this, TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

So the scenario is:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

So x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

The relationship between x and z depends on whether they touch the same part of y's boundary:
1. If they touch the same part of y's boundary, then EC(x,z) holds.
2. If they touch different parts of y's boundary, then DC(x,z) holds.

So the answer is: DC or EC.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's go back to the definition:

- TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

OK so our scenario is:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So x is outside y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

The relationship between x and z depends on whether they touch the same part of y's boundary:
1. If they touch the same part of y's boundary, then EC(x,z) holds.
2. If they touch different parts of y's boundary, then DC(x,z) holds.

So the answer is: DC or EC.

Great, I think I have the answer: DC or EC.

Actually, let me double-check using a concrete example:

Imagine a scenario where:
- y is a circle.
- x is a square outside the circle, touching the circle at one point on the boundary.
- z is a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at the same point where x touches it.

In this case, x and z touch at the boundary, so EC(x,z) holds.

Now imagine another scenario:
- y is a circle.
- x is a square outside the circle, touching the circle at the left side of the boundary.
- z is a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at the right side.

In this case, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z) holds.

These examples confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are DC and EC.

Actually, I need to make sure. Is it possible for the relationship to be PO (partial overlap) or TPP (tangential proper part)? Let's see:

- Can x and z partially overlap (PO)? No, because z is entirely within y, and x is entirely outside y except for possibly boundary points. So x and z cannot share any interior points, which means they cannot partially overlap.

- Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))? No, because x is outside y except for boundary points, while z is inside y. So x cannot be inside z.

- Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x))? No, because z is inside y, while x is outside y except for boundary points. So z cannot be inside x.

- Can x and z be equal (EQ(x,z))? No, because z is inside y, while x is outside y except for boundary points. So x and z cannot be equal.

So the only possible relations between x and z are DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected).

Actually, let me try one more approach to make sure I'm right. I'll think about the composition table for RCC-8.

In the composition table for RCC-8, the entry for EC ∘ TPPi (that is, the composition of EC and TPPi) should give us the possible relations between x and z.

According to the composition table, the result of EC ∘ TPPi is DC or EC.

So the possible relationships between x and z are DC and EC, which matches our analysis.

Final answer: DC or EC.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships can exist between x and z given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share interior parts
- TPPi(y,z): which means TPP(z,y), so z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary

From these facts:
- x is outside y but touches y's boundary
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary

Now I need to determine what relationship can hold between x and z. Since z is inside y and x is outside y, the relationship depends on whether they touch at the same part of y's boundary:

1. If x and z touch the same part of y's boundary, then EC(x,z) would hold (they touch but don't overlap)
2. If x and z touch different parts of y's boundary, then DC(x,z) would hold (they are completely disconnected)

No other relationship is possible because z is entirely within y while x is entirely outside y (except at boundary points).
