PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm given two spatial relationships:
1. NTPPi(x, y): NTPP(y, x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary).
2. NTPPi(y, z): NTPP(z, y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary).

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationship(s) between x and z.

Given:
- y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)

This implies that z is completely inside x. Since z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, z must be even further inside x than y is. Therefore, z cannot touch x's boundary.

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(z, x), which means NTPP(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Wait, I need to double-check this. 

NTPPi(x, y) means NTPP(y, x): y is completely inside x
NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y): z is completely inside y

So we have:
- y is completely inside x
- z is completely inside y

Therefore, z is completely inside x, which means NTPP(z, x) or equivalently NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, let me be even more careful about the notation to make sure I'm getting this right.

NTPPi(x, y) means NTPP(y, x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This implies that z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Given these two facts, we can conclude that z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is because z is inside y, which is itself inside x and away from x's boundary. So z must be even further inside x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z, x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x, z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning with a simple diagram. Imagine three concentric circles:
- The largest circle is x
- The middle circle is y (completely inside x, not touching x's boundary)
- The smallest circle is z (completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)

In this scenario, z is clearly completely inside x and not touching x's boundary, which confirms that NTPP(z, x) or equivalently NTPPi(x, z) is the correct relationship.

So the final answer is: NTPPi(x, z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship between x and z follows from the given relationships NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these relationships mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)

From these facts:
- If z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x
- Then z must be completely inside x
- Additionally, since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).
