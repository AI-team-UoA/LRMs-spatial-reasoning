PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We are asked to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's recall the definitions of the RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), meaning y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same region).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

What are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's think through this systematically by considering each possible relationship and whether it's consistent with the given constraints:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is certainly possible. For example, imagine x and z as two separate circles, and y as a third circle that touches both x and z at different points.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   This is also possible. Imagine x, y, and z as three circles arranged in a line, where x touches y, y touches z, and x also touches z at a point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap partially.
   This is possible too. Imagine x and z as two circles that overlap, and y as a third shape that touches both x and z at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to be inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is strictly contained within z without touching z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, it seems inconsistent for x to be strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. But I need to be careful here. Let me think more about this...

   Wait, it could be possible if y penetrates into z, and x is inside z but touches y at a point inside z. So NTPP(x,z) seems possible too.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPP, but with roles reversed. This is possible for the same reasons.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to NTPP, but with roles reversed. This is possible for the same reasons.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   If x and z are the same, and both EC to y, this seems consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful with my reasoning, especially for cases 5-8. Let me reconsider some of these.

Actually, I think I was right about NTPP(x,z) being possible. Imagine a scenario where z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle that touches z from the inside (so it's a TPP of z), and x is an even smaller circle inside z that touches y but is far from z's boundary. In this case, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), imagine z as a small circle inside x, and y as a circle that touches both x and z from inside x. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

For EQ(x,z), I think I was wrong. If x and z are the same region, and both are EC to y, then y would have to touch the same region at two different points, which contradicts the definition of EC. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check all of these with more careful reasoning:

1. DC(x,z): Possible, as explained above.

2. EC(x,z): Possible, as explained above.

3. PO(x,z): Possible, as explained above.

4. TPP(x,z): 
   Let's consider this more carefully. If x is a TPP of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), y must either be partially inside z or touching z from the outside. Since EC(y,z), y must be touching z from the outside. But then, if x is inside z and touches y which is outside z, x must touch z's boundary at exactly the point where y touches z. This seems like a very specific and unlikely scenario, but it's not impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is NTPP of z, then x is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. But x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (EC(y,z)). If y is outside z, then x can't touch y. If y is partially inside z, then for x to touch y without touching z's boundary, y must penetrate inside z. This seems inconsistent with EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   Similar to TPP, but with roles reversed. If z is a TPP of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary (EC(y,z)), y must either be partially inside x or touching x from the outside. If EC(x,y), then y must be touching x from the outside. But then, if z is inside x and touches y which is outside x, z must touch x's boundary at exactly the point where y touches x. This is a very specific scenario, but it's not impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   Similar to NTPP, but with roles reversed. If z is NTPP of x, then z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. But z touches y's boundary (EC(y,z)), and y touches x's boundary (EC(x,y)). This leads to the same inconsistency as in case 5. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
   If x and z are the same region, and both are EC to y, then there's only one region (call it x/z) that's EC to y. This is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

Hmm, I seem to be contradicting myself. Let me think more carefully...

For NTPP(x,z), I initially thought it was possible, but then I decided it wasn't. Let me reconsider:

If x is NTPP of z, then x is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (EC(y,z)).

For this to be consistent, y must partially penetrate into z, touching z's boundary from the outside, and also touching x from inside z. This doesn't contradict EC(y,z) or EC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) seems possible after all.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), if z is NTPP of x, it's consistent if y partially penetrates into x, touching x's boundary from the outside and touching z from inside x.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, and both are EC to y, then it's as if one region (x/z) is EC to y. This is consistent.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it differently:

The RCC-8 relations are based on the relationships between the interiors, boundaries, and exteriors of regions. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), it means that the boundaries of x and y intersect, and the boundaries of y and z intersect, but their interiors don't intersect.

Given this, let's systematically check each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): The boundaries and interiors of x and z don't intersect. This is consistent with the given constraints because x can touch y at one point, y can touch z at another point, and x and z can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): The boundaries of x and z intersect, but their interiors don't. This is consistent because x, y, and z can be arranged in a way that they all touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): The interiors of x and z intersect, but neither is a subset of the other. This is consistent because x and z can overlap in a region that doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and their boundaries intersect. This is consistent because x can be inside z, touching z's boundary at the same point where y touches both x and z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and their boundaries don't intersect. As I discussed, this is also consistent because y can penetrate into z, touching z's boundary from the outside and touching x from inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and their boundaries intersect. This is consistent for the same reasons as TPP, but with roles reversed.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and their boundaries don't intersect. This is consistent for the same reasons as NTPP, but with roles reversed.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is consistent because then it's just one region that's EC to y.

So, all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

However, I'm not feeling 100% confident in this. Let me try to think about this more carefully and see if I can find a contradiction for any of these cases.

Actually, there are some conceptual difficulties I'm facing. For example, in the case of NTPP(x,z), I've said that y can penetrate into z. But if y penetrates into z, then we have more than just a boundary intersection, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) should not be possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), if y penetrates into x, it contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me reconsider these cases:

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and their boundaries don't intersect. If x is strictly inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then y must reach inside z to touch x. But then, y would have more than just a boundary intersection with z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and their boundaries don't intersect. Similarly, if z is strictly inside x, and z touches y's boundary, then y must reach inside x to touch z. But then, y would have more than just a boundary intersection with x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For the other cases, I stand by my earlier assessments.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

Wait, I need to be more careful about EQ(x,z) as well. If x and z are the same region, and both are EC to y, then it's as if one region (x/z) is EC to y. This is consistent.

So, the final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

Actually, let's question EQ(x,z) too: 

If x is the same as z (EQ(x,z)), then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) mean the same thing: the region x/z has a boundary contact with y. This is consistent.

So my previous list is correct. Let me double check once more, consider DC(x,z) to NTPPi(x,z) to EQ(x,z) and see if they're consistent with the given constraints.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no points. This is consistent because x can touch y at one point, y can touch z at another point, and x and z can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. This is consistent because x, y, and z can be arranged so that they all touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap partially, but neither is part of the other. This is consistent because x and z can overlap in a region that doesn't include the points where they touch y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch x and z at the same point on their boundaries. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must penetrate into z to touch x. But if y penetrates into z, it contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch x and z at the same point on their boundaries. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must penetrate into x to touch z. But if y penetrates into x, it contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) describe the same relationship: y touches the boundary of the region x/z. This is consistent.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

That's our final answer.

Actually, let me double check the TPP case once more. I'm not sure if the reasoning I used was correct, and I want to check against the actual definitions of the RCC-8 relations.

The RCC-8 relations are based on the topological relationships between the interiors and boundaries of regions.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z, and their boundaries intersect. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and both x and z touch y at their boundaries, it seems consistent for x and z to touch y at the same point on their respective boundaries. However, this implies a very specific configuration. Let me visualize it:

Imagine z as a large circle. x is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a specific point. y is another circle outside z, touching z's boundary at the same point where x touches z. In this configuration, x and y both touch z's boundary at the same point, but they don't touch each other.

Wait, for TPP(x,z) we have EC(x,y) too. So, the configuration I described doesn't work. 

If TPP(x,z) and EC(x,y), then x is inside z, touching z's boundary, and also touching y's boundary. For EC(y,z), y must touch z's boundary but not its interior.

Let's visualize again: z is a large circle. x is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a specific point. y is another circle outside z, touching z's boundary at the same point where x touches z. In this configuration, x touches z's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, but x and y don't necessarily touch each other.

Actually, in this configuration, x and y would touch at the same point where both touch z's boundary. So, the configuration is consistent with EC(x,y).

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), the configuration is consistent.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) describe the same relationship: y touches the boundary of the region x/z. This is consistent.

So, I stand by my earlier answer. The possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me double check the EQ case once more. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same region, and both are EC to y, then it's as if one region (x/z) is EC to y. This is consistent.

But one could argue that the original statements EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are not redundant, but refer to two different boundary intersections between y and the region x/z. But, if x/z is a single region, and it externally connects to y at two different points, then y would still be externally connected to x/z, which is consistent with the RCC-8 relation EC.

Actually, I need to be careful, we're not making any assumptions of the shapes of the regions. In the RCC-8 relations, the regions can be of arbitrary shape. 

So, for TPP(x,z), if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, it's possible for y to touch z's boundary and also touch x's boundary at the point where x touches z's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, it's possible for y to touch x's boundary and also touch z's boundary at the point where z touches x's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) describe the same relationship: y touches the boundary of the region x/z. This is consistent.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Hmm, I keep circling back to the same answer. Let me see if I can find a counterexample for any of these relationships to be sure.

Actually, I think the EQ(x,z) case might be more complex. Let's think of it this way: if x and z are the same region, then the statements EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are identical. They both say that y touches the boundary of the region x/z.

But we usually expect two different statements to provide different information. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are given as separate constraints, it suggests that y touches x at one point and z at another point. If x and z are the same region, this would mean y touches the region x/z at two different points, which is still an external connection, consistent with EC.

So, I believe EQ(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

For the TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) cases, my earlier reasoning holds. These are possible relationships, but they require a specific configuration.

For the cases where I claimed the relationship is not possible (NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)), my reasoning stands as well. These would require y to penetrate into the outer region, which contradicts the external connection.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let's accept this as the final answer and move on.

Let me look more closely at the case TPP(x,z) with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). In this case, x is a proper part of z, and x touches z's boundary. Also, y touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary.

For this to be consistent, y must touch both x and z at the point where x touches z. This ensures that y has an external connection to both x and z.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x, and z touches x's boundary. y touches z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary. For this to be consistent, y must touch both x and z at the point where z touches x.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. In this case, EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) describe the same relationship: y touches the boundary of the region x/z. This is consistent.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

I believe this answer is correct.

I'll double check with the composition table for RCC-8. 

For the composition EC(x,y) ∘ EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are the union of: 
{DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ}

This matches our answer. So the answer is:

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Wait, just to double check, I want to make sure I'm getting the right answer.

Looks like we've been asked to give the RCC-8 composition EC ∘ EC, which should be equivalent to the set:
{DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ}

But I want to double check once more to make sure we haven't missed anything. We eliminated NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). 

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z's boundary. If x is strictly inside z without touching z's boundary, it's hard to see how y can touch both x's boundary and z's boundary without penetrating into z. And if y penetrates into z, it contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), y touches x's boundary. If z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, it's hard to see how y can touch both z's boundary and x's boundary without penetrating into x. And if y penetrates into x, it contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

This is our final answer.

Actually, I'm not convinced EQ(x,z) is a valid answer. If x and z are identical, then the statements EC(x,y) and EC(z,y) are the same statement. Given that the two statements are not guaranteed to be identical (i.e., they could describe y connecting to the single region x/z at two different points), I think we need to be more cautious.

Actually, no, I think EQ(x,z) is a valid answer. If x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) both describe y touching the boundary of the region x/z. It doesn't specify where on the boundary, so y could touch the region x/z at multiple points, and it would still be an external connection. The key is that the interiors of y and x/z don't intersect, which is consistent with EC.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me finalize the answer.

The possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to find all possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each potential relationship:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine two circles x and z that are completely separate, with a third circle y touching both x and z at different points of their boundaries.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. Three circles can be arranged where each touches the other two at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. Regions x and z can partially overlap while both externally connect to y at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. Region x can be inside z touching z's boundary, and y can touch both x and z at the same point where x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y cannot simultaneously touch x's boundary and z's boundary without penetrating into z, which would violate EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible, by the same reasoning as TPP but with roles reversed.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is not possible, by the same reasoning as NTPP but with roles reversed.

8. EQ(x,z): This is possible. If x and z are the same region, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) describe the same relationship.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
