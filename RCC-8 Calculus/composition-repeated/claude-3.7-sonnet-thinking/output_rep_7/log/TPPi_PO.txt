PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the question carefully. We're told two relations: 
1. TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.
2. PO(y,z), which means that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is contained within the other.

We need to determine what relation or relations could hold between x and z.

Let's think about what TPPi(x,y) tells us. It means that y is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since y touches x's boundary, there are parts of y that are at the boundary of x.

And PO(y,z) tells us that y and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. So some part of z is inside y, and some part of z is outside y.

Given these constraints, what are the possibilities for the relation between x and z?

Since y is inside x and z overlaps with y, at least some part of z must be inside x (the part that overlaps with y). But z also has parts outside of y. These parts could be:
1. Still inside x but not overlapping with y
2. Outside x entirely

Let's consider the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know z shares parts with y, and y is inside x, so z must share parts with x as well. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. However, since z shares interior points with y, and y is inside x, z must share interior points with x. So EC is not possible either.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. Some part of z is inside x (the part that overlaps with y), and some part of z could be outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems unlikely because y is inside x, and z overlaps with y, but doesn't contain y. Since x contains y, it's hard to see how z could contain x. Let me think about this more... Actually, it might be possible if z extends beyond x's boundary in some directions, and x touches z's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, this seems unlikely for the same reason as TPPi. But let me reconsider... If z encompasses x entirely and extends beyond x's boundary in all directions, then x would not touch z's boundary. So NTPPi could be possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. This seems unlikely because z overlaps with y but doesn't contain y, while x does contain y. So x and z can't be identical.

Let me reconsider some of these:

For TPPi(x,z), we would need x to be completely inside z, with x touching z's boundary. Given that TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), this means y is inside x and y partially overlaps with z. It's hard to satisfy all of these constraints, but let's see... If z encompasses both y and x, with x touching z's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) would hold. This seems possible, so let's keep TPPi as a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z), we would need x to be completely inside z, without x touching z's boundary. With the given constraints, this would mean z extends beyond x in all directions. This seems possible, so let's keep NTPPi as a possibility.

For EQ(x,z), we would need x and z to be identical. But given that PO(y,z) means y and z share some parts but neither is contained in the other, while TPPi(x,y) means y is completely contained in x, it doesn't seem possible for x and z to be identical. So EQ is not a possibility.

Let me check my reasoning again:

First, we know that y is completely contained in x (from TPPi(x,y)).
Second, we know that y partially overlaps with z (from PO(y,z)).

Given these two facts, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is inside x and z overlaps with y, there must be some part of z that is inside x. However, since y and z only partially overlap, there must also be some part of z that doesn't overlap with y. This part could be inside x or outside x.

Let's reconsider the possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as explained before.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible, as explained before.
3. PO(x,z): Possible if some part of z is inside x and some part is outside x.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible if z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if z is entirely inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is completely inside x and y partially overlaps with z, this would mean y is completely inside z as well. But that contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z share some parts but neither is contained in the other. So TPPi is not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPPi, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPPi is not possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible, as explained before.

Wait, let me be more careful. For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), I was too quick to rule them out. Let's reconsider:

For TPPi(x,z), we have x completely inside z, touching z's boundary. Now, for PO(y,z), we need y and z to partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other. Given that y is completely inside x, and x is completely inside z, we would have y completely inside z as well. But that contradicts PO(y,z). So TPPi is indeed not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), by the same reasoning, y would have to be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z). So NTPPi is also not possible.

Now let's be careful with TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z), we would have z completely inside x, touching x's boundary. For PO(y,z), we need y and z to partially overlap. Given that y is also completely inside x, it's possible for y and z to partially overlap inside x. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), we would have z completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. Again, given that y is also completely inside x, it's possible for y and z to partially overlap inside x. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I think I've been making an error. For TPP(x,z), we would have z completely inside x, touching x's boundary. If z is completely inside x and y is completely inside x, then the only way for y and z to interact is if they overlap. But PO(y,z) requires that neither y nor z is contained in the other. If z is completely inside x, and y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, then it's possible for z to be partially contained in y. This would contradict PO(y,z), which requires that neither is contained in the other.

Let me think this through more carefully:

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other.

Let's think of it visually. Imagine x as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, and z as another shape that partially overlaps with y.

For the relation between x and z, let's consider each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must also overlap with x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since z shares interior points with y, and y is inside x, z must share interior points with x. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other. This is possible. Part of z overlaps with y (and hence with x), and part of z extends outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that y is a tangential proper part of x and y partially overlaps with z, this would mean y is completely inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So TPPi is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. By the same reasoning as for TPPi, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPPi is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. Given that y is completely inside x and y partially overlaps with z, this would mean y is completely inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But wait, I think I need to be more careful about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). 

For TPP(x,z), we would have z completely inside x, touching x's boundary. For PO(y,z), we need y and z to partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other. If z is completely inside x, and y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, then it's possible for y and z to interact in various ways. 

If z is very small and only overlaps with a small part of y, then neither would be contained in the other, which is consistent with PO(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, it's still possible for y and z to partially overlap with neither being contained in the other. So NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

What about EQ(x,z)? This would mean x and z are identical. Given that y is completely inside x and y partially overlaps with z, this would mean y partially overlaps with x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which says y is completely inside x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think through these graphically. 

1. We know that y is contained in x from TPPi(x,y).
2. We know that y and z partially overlap from PO(y,z).

How can x and z be related?

DC - Disconnected: Not possible, because z must overlap with x since it overlaps with y, which is inside x.
EC - Externally connected: Not possible, because z must share interior points with x since it overlaps with y, which is inside x.
PO - Partially overlapping: Possible, if some of z is inside x and some is outside.
TPP - Tangential proper part: Possible, if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPP - Non-tangential proper part: Possible, if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPPi - Inverse tangential proper part: This would mean x is inside z. If x is inside z, then y must also be inside z (since y is inside x). But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap with neither being contained in the other. So TPPi is not possible.
NTPPi - Inverse non-tangential proper part: By the same reasoning as for TPPi, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPPi is not possible.
EQ - Equal: This would mean x and z are the same. But if x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y must be inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ is not possible.

Actually, let me be extra careful about my logic. 

For TPPi(x,z), we would have x inside z, touching z's boundary. For TPPi(x,y), we have y inside x, touching x's boundary. This means y is inside z (by transitivity), and y might or might not touch z's boundary. For PO(y,z), we need y and z to partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other. But if y is inside z, this contradicts PO(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), we would have x inside z, not touching z's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPPi, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I've been making an error in my understanding of TPPi. Let me clarify:

TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is completely contained within y, and x touches y's boundary.

That doesn't seem right either. Let me define these clearly:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is completely contained within y and x ≠ y), and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), so it means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x, y ≠ x, and y touches the boundary of x.

Now, back to the problem:

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is completely inside x, y ≠ x, and y touches x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other.

Let's reconsider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must also overlap with x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since z shares interior points with y, and y is inside x, z must share interior points with x. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other. This is possible. Part of z overlaps with y (and hence with x), and part of z extends outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x). This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. By the same reasoning as for TPP, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Since y is also inside x, it's possible for y and z to partially overlap within x, satisfying PO(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, since y is also inside x, y and z can partially overlap within x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. If x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I've been inconsistent with my deductions. Let me try one more time, working more carefully.

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is completely inside x, y ≠ x, and y touches x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other.

Let's reconsider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must also overlap with x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since z shares interior points with y, and y is inside x, z must share interior points with x. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other. This is possible. Part of z overlaps with y (and hence with x), and part of z extends outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x). This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. By the same reasoning as for TPP, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This doesn't contradict any of the given relations. y is inside x, and z is inside x, so y and z can partially overlap within x, satisfying PO(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this doesn't contradict any of the given relations.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. If x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Now let me be extra careful and check each of these by drawing out what they would look like:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Part of z is inside x, and part of z is outside x. This is consistent with y being inside x and y partially overlapping with z.

2. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside x and y partially overlapping with z. y and z could be two shapes inside x that partially overlap.

3. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this is consistent with y being inside x and y partially overlapping with z.

So, these three relations—PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z)—are indeed the possible relationships between x and z.

But wait, let me think about this more. 

For DC(x,z) - Disconnected: If x and z are disconnected, then there's no way for y (which is inside x) to overlap with z. So DC is not possible.

For EC(x,z) - Externally connected: If x and z only touch at their boundaries, then y (which is inside x) can't overlap with z. So EC is not possible.

For PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: If x and z partially overlap, then z could overlap with y (which is inside x) in the region where x and z overlap. This is consistent with PO(y,z). So PO is possible.

For TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z. This means y (which is inside x) is also completely inside z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So TPP is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then, as with TPP, y would be completely inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside x and y partially overlapping with z. Both y and z are inside x, and they partially overlap. So TPPi is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside x and y partially overlapping with z. So NTPPi is possible.

For EQ(x,z) - Equal: If x and z are the same, then y (which is inside x) would be inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me visualize this a bit more. 

For DC(x,z) - Disconnected: If x and z have no points in common, and y is inside x, then there's no way for y and z to have any points in common either. This contradicts PO(y,z). So DC is not possible.

For EC(x,z) - Externally connected: If x and z share boundary points but no interior points, and y is inside x, then y and z can't have any interior points in common. This contradicts PO(y,z), which requires y and z to share interior points. So EC is not possible.

For PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: If x and z partially overlap, then some of z is inside x, and some is outside. y is inside x, and it's possible for y to overlap with the part of z that's inside x. This doesn't contradict any of the given relations. So PO is possible.

For TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) is also completely inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So TPP is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) is also completely inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So NTPP is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, then it's possible for y and z to partially overlap inside x, with neither being contained in the other. This doesn't contradict any of the given relations. So TPPi is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then it's possible for y and z to partially overlap inside x, with neither being contained in the other. This doesn't contradict any of the given relations. So NTPPi is possible.

For EQ(x,z) - Equal: If x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y is inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So EQ is not possible.

Let me also think about the definition of "partially overlaps" one more time. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other. In other words, there's a region that's common to both y and z, but neither y nor z is completely contained in the other.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me check DC(x,z) one more time: If x and z are disconnected, then they share no points. But y is inside x and overlaps with z, so y and z share points. This means x and z must also share points (since y is inside x). So DC(x,z) is not possible. 

EC(x,z): If x and z only share boundary points, then y (which is inside x) can't share interior points with z. But PO(y,z) requires y and z to share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Given the constraints, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me check my work one more time to make sure I haven't missed anything or made any logical errors:

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is completely inside x, y ≠ x, and y touches x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other.

Let's reconsider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must also overlap with x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since z shares interior points with y, and y is inside x, z must share interior points with x. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other. This is possible. Part of z overlaps with y (and hence with x), and part of z extends outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x). This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. By the same reasoning as for TPP, this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This doesn't contradict any of the given relations. y is inside x, and z is inside x, so y and z can partially overlap within x, satisfying PO(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this doesn't contradict any of the given relations.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. If x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to triple check with a visual representation:

TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x, touching x's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither containing the other.

For PO(x,z):
```
     +----------+
     |     x    |
     |  +---+   |
     |  | y |   |
     |  +---+   |
     |          |
     +----------+
   +----------+
   |    z     |
   +----------+
```
In this case, y is inside x (touching x's boundary), and y and z partially overlap. Neither y nor z contains the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
```
     +----------+
     |     x    |
     |  +---+   |
     |  | y |   |
     |  +---+   |
     |  +---+   |
     |  | z |   |
     |  +---+   |
     +----------+
```
In this case, z is inside x (touching x's boundary), y is inside x (touching x's boundary), and y and z partially overlap. Neither y nor z contains the other. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
```
     +----------+
     |     x    |
     |  +---+   |
     |  | y |   |
     |  +---+   |
     |   +---+  |
     |   | z |  |
     |   +---+  |
     +----------+
```
In this case, z is inside x (not touching x's boundary), y is inside x (touching x's boundary), and y and z partially overlap. Neither y nor z contains the other. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

But let me double check PO(x,z) with another visual representation. For PO(x,z), I need to make sure that a part of z is inside x and a part of z is outside x.

```
     +----------+
     |     x    |
     |  +---+   |
     |  | y |...|...
     |  +---+   |   .
     |          |    .
     +----------+     .
                       .
                        .
                     +---.--+
                     |  z    |
                     +-------+
```
In this case, y is inside x (touching x's boundary), and a part of z overlaps with y (and hence with x), while another part of z is outside x. y and z partially overlap, with neither containing the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK. Let me check one last time. I'll be very precise.

Given:
1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is completely inside x, y ≠ x, and y touches x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither being contained in the other.

I need to find the possible relations between x and z. I'll go through each of the eight RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z have no points in common. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must also overlap with x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This means x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since z shares interior points with y (from PO(y,z)), and y is inside x, z must share interior points with x. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This means x and z share some but not all of their points, and neither is completely contained in the other. This is possible. z can overlap with y (which is inside x), and extend outside x. This doesn't contradict any of the given relations.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside z, then y (which is inside x) is also inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So TPP is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. As with TPP, this contradicts PO(y,z) because it would make y completely inside z. So NTPP is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside x and y partially overlapping with z. Both y and z are inside x, and they can partially overlap without one containing the other. So TPPi is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also consistent with y being inside x and y partially overlapping with z. So NTPPi is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is contained in the other. So EQ is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

To summarize:
- DC(x,z) - Not possible because z must overlap with x since it overlaps with y, which is inside x.
- EC(x,z) - Not possible because z must share interior points with x since it overlaps with y, which is inside x.
- PO(x,z) - Possible if part of z is inside x and part is outside.
- TPP(x,z) - Not possible because it would make y inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).
- NTPP(x,z) - Not possible, for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z) - Possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z) - Possible if z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z) - Not possible because it would make y inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me draw one more set of diagrams to make sure I haven't missed anything. 

For PO(x,z): 
- Part of z is inside x, and part is outside.
- y is inside x and partially overlaps with z.
- Neither y nor z is contained in the other.

For TPPi(x,z):
- z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
- y is inside x and partially overlaps with z.
- Neither y nor z is contained in the other.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- y is inside x and partially overlaps with z.
- Neither y nor z is contained in the other.

All three of these relations are consistent with the given constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to find all possible relationships between x and z based on the given constraints.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, meaning they share some spatial part but neither is contained in the other

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Not possible. Since y overlaps with z and y is inside x, z must share points with x.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Not possible. Since y and z share interior points (from their partial overlap) and y is inside x, z must share interior points with x.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Possible. Part of z can overlap with y (which is inside x) while another part of z extends outside x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Not possible. If x were completely inside z, then y would also be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Not possible, for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary, while partially overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
