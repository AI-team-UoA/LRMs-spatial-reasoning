PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the relationships.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely contained within z and does not touch the boundary of z.

I need to determine what relationship exists between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same region. Whatever relationship y has with z, x will have the same relationship with z.

We know that NTPP(y,z), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of z. Since x is equivalent to y (EQ(x,y)), x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the relationship between x and z.

Let me double-check this reasoning:

If x = y (which is what EQ(x,y) implies), and y is contained within z without touching its boundary (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be contained within z without touching its boundary.

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationship exists between x and z based on the given information.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are the same region spatially, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
