PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this. We're told that:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.

I need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z.

Since x is completely contained within y (NTPP(x,y)), and y only touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), let's think about what this means for x and z:

- Can x and z overlap (PO)? No, because x is completely inside y, and y only touches z at the boundary. If x overlapped with z, then y would also overlap with z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

- Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)? No, because x is completely inside y, and y only touches z at the boundary. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would have to touch z's boundary, which means x would also have to touch y's boundary (to "reach" z). But this contradicts NTPP(x,y), which says x doesn't touch y's boundary.

- Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)? No, for similar reasons as above. If x were completely inside z, then y would have to overlap with z significantly, not just touch at the boundary.

- Can x be equal to z (EQ)? No, because x is strictly contained within y, and z is outside y except at their common boundary.

- Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)? No, because x is strictly smaller than y, and z extends outside of y.

- Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)? No, for similar reasons as TPPi.

- Can x and z be externally connected (EC)? This seems possible if x touches y's boundary exactly where y touches z. But wait - NTPP(x,y) specifically means x doesn't touch y's boundary. So x can't touch z either, which means EC is impossible.

- Can x and z be disconnected (DC)? Yes, this seems like the only possible relation. Since x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z must be completely disconnected.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this by thinking about a concrete example:
- Imagine y is a solid circle
- x is a smaller circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- z is another circle that touches y's boundary at just one point

In this scenario, x and z are clearly disconnected (DC). This confirms my reasoning.

Actually, wait. Let me think more carefully. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot share any points. They must be disconnected.

So the relationship between x and z must be DC(x,z) (disconnected).

I can't think of any other possible relationship that could hold between x and z given the constraints, so my final answer is:

The only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap

Since x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary) and z only touches y at y's boundary, x and z cannot:
- Share any points (ruling out PO, TPP, NTPP, EQ, TPPi, NTPPi)
- Touch at their boundaries (ruling out EC)

The only possible relation is that x and z are completely disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
