PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between regions x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relations mean:

1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. This means they share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

2. EC(y,z) - y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, I need to consider what relations are possible between x and z given these constraints.

Let's go through the 8 possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y in a region that doesn't touch z, then x and z could be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected.
   This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y and extends to touch z at the boundary where y and z meet, then x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. If x extends beyond its overlap with y into z, then x and z could partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. If x is contained within z and touches the boundary of z, and x also partially overlaps with y which is externally connected to z, then x could be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. If x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and still partially overlaps with y which is externally connected to z, then x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. If z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x, and y (which partially overlaps with x) is externally connected to z, then z could be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. If z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, and y (which partially overlaps with x) is externally connected to z, then z could be a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   I don't think this is possible. If x and z are equal, and PO(x,y), then y would have to partially overlap with z. But we're given that EC(y,z), which means y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. This contradicts the partial overlap.

Actually, I should double-check my reasoning here. If EQ(x,z), then any relation that holds between x and another region should also hold between z and that region. But we're given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). Since partial overlap (PO) and external connection (EC) are different relations, x and z cannot be equal.

Let me also reconsider TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Given that PO(x,y), x shares some part with y but not all of y. Given that EC(y,z), y only touches z at the boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then x must be entirely within z. But then how can x overlap with y, which is only touching z at the boundary? This seems contradictory, so TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. Again, if x is entirely within z and not touching z's boundary, it's hard to see how x could overlap with y, which is only touching z at the boundary. So NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible either.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Given that EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is a proper part of x, then z is entirely within x. This means that y, which touches z at the boundary, would also have to touch x at some boundary. But given PO(x,y), y and x overlap in their interiors. This seems contradictory, so TPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. Given that EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is entirely within x and not touching x's boundary, then y, which touches z at the boundary, would be inside x. But given PO(x,y), y and x overlap but y is not entirely within x. This seems contradictory, so NTPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Wait, I think I need to be more careful here. Let's think about these one by one, with more specific examples.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   Example: Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z as a circle that touches y at a single point but is far away from x. Then x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected.
   Example: Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z as a circle that touches y at a single point. If x also extends to touch z at that same point, then x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   Example: Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z as a circle that touches y at a single point. If x extends beyond y to overlap with z, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   I need to reconsider this. If x is partially overlapping with y, and y is externally connected to z, could x be entirely within z? I think this might be possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary at the point where y and z meet.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   I need to reconsider this too. If x is partially overlapping with y, and y is externally connected to z, could x be entirely within z without touching z's boundary? This doesn't seem possible, because if x overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x would have to extend to that boundary to overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Example: Imagine x as a large circle, y as a circle that partially overlaps with x, and z as a small circle entirely within x that touches x's boundary and also touches y at that boundary. Then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Example: Imagine x as a large circle, y as a circle that partially overlaps with x, and z as a small circle entirely within x (not touching x's boundary) that touches y at y's boundary. Then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   As I mentioned earlier, this is not possible because it would lead to a contradiction with the given relations.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) with more care. 

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that PO(x,y), x shares some part with y. Given that EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. If x is inside z and also overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x would have to extend to z's boundary at the point where y touches z. This means x would touch z's boundary, which is consistent with TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) seems possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. Given that PO(x,y), x shares some part with y. Given that EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. If x is inside z and also overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x would have to extend to the part of y that touches z's boundary. But this would mean x touches z's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Let me double-check TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) again.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, then y would also have to touch x at x's boundary. But given PO(x,y), y and x overlap in their interiors. This doesn't seem to lead to a contradiction, as y could both overlap with x in their interiors and touch at a boundary. So TPPi(x,z) seems possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. Given that EC(y,z), y touches z at their boundaries. If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, then y would have to extend into the interior of x to touch z. This is consistent with PO(x,y), as y and x would overlap in their interiors. So NTPPi(x,z) also seems possible.

Let me reconsider one more time. I'll try to think about these in a more systematic way. Given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), where can x be in relation to z?

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is definitely possible, as x could overlap with a part of y that's far from z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected.
   This is also possible, as x could overlap with a part of y that touches z.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible as well, as x could extend beyond its overlap with y to overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x would have to be entirely within z and touch z's boundary. But x also has to overlap with y, which only touches z at the boundary. This means x would have to reach the boundary of z where y touches it. This does seem possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x would have to be entirely within z and not touch z's boundary. But x also has to overlap with y, which only touches z at the boundary. This means x would have to reach the boundary of z where y touches it, which contradicts the definition of NTPP. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z would have to be entirely within x and touch x's boundary. z also touches y at the boundary (given EC(y,z)). This means y would have to touch x at the boundary where z touches x. But y also has to overlap with x in their interiors (given PO(x,y)). This doesn't lead to a contradiction, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z would have to be entirely within x and not touch x's boundary. z also touches y at the boundary (given EC(y,z)). This means y would have to extend into the interior of x to touch z. This is consistent with PO(x,y), so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   As I mentioned earlier, this is not possible because it would lead to a contradiction with the given relations. If x and z are equal, then any relation that holds between x and another region should also hold between z and that region. But we're given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), which are different relations.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z) again. I've been assuming that if x overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x must extend to the boundary of z. But that's not necessarily true. x could overlap with a part of y that's away from where y touches z. Then, if x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, NTPP(x,z) would be true.

So, I need to reconsider whether NTPP(x,z) is possible after all.

Actually, I see the problem. If NTPP(x,z), then x is entirely contained within the interior of z. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points. But if EC(y,z), then y and z don't share any interior points; they only touch at their boundaries. So, if x is in the interior of z and also shares interior points with y, then y must also have some points in the interior of z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

But wait, let me think again about TPP(x,z). For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would have to be entirely within z and touch z's boundary. x also overlaps with y. Given that EC(y,z), y only touches z at the boundary. If x is inside z and also overlaps with y, then y would have to extend into the interior of z to overlap with x. But this contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible either.

Actually, I'm getting confused because I'm not being precise enough. Let me more carefully consider each relation.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, and x also overlaps with y, then y would have to extend into the interior of z to overlap with x. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z don't share any interior points. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

But wait, I'm not being clear about what "overlap" means. PO(x,y) means that x and y share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. So, x and y share some interior points. If TPP(x,z), then x is entirely within z, and so the interior points that x shares with y would have to be within z. But this would mean that y has some interior points within z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I need to be more systematic. Let's use the definitions:

- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. x could overlap with a part of y that's away from where y touches z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.
   This is possible. x could overlap with a part of y and extend to touch z at the boundary where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other.
   This is possible. x could extend beyond its overlap with y to overlap with the interior of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
   If x is entirely within z, then all of x's interior points are inside z. But x shares interior points with y (given PO(x,y)), so these shared interior points would have to be inside z. This would mean that y has some interior points inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   Similar to TPP, if x is entirely within z, then all of x's interior points are inside z. But x shares interior points with y, so these shared interior points would have to be inside z. This would mean that y has some interior points inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
   This is possible. z could be entirely within x and touch x's boundary, and y could touch z at the boundary (given EC(y,z)) and also overlap with x in their interiors (given PO(x,y)).

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   This is possible. z could be entirely within x and not touch x's boundary, and y could touch z at the boundary (given EC(y,z)) and also overlap with x in their interiors (given PO(x,y)).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are equal, then any relation that holds between x and another region should also hold between z and that region. But we're given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), which are different relations. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

But I should reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) again, because I think I've been too hasty in dismissing them.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. x also overlaps with y (given PO(x,y)), which means they share some interior points. y touches z at the boundary (given EC(y,z)) but doesn't share any interior points with z. If x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary, and x also shares some interior points with y, then y would have to have some interior points inside z to overlap with x. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z don't share any interior points. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), the reasoning is similar. If x is entirely within the interior of z, and x shares interior points with y, then y would have to have some interior points inside z to overlap with x. But this contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, my conclusion remains the same: the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, wait, I think I've been making a mistake in my reasoning about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. z also touches y at the boundary (given EC(y,z)). But y overlaps with x (given PO(x,y)), which means they share some interior points. If z is entirely within x, then the boundary of z (where y touches it) would be within x or at the boundary of x. If it's within x, then y, which touches z at the boundary, would have to extend into the interior of x. This seems consistent with PO(x,y), so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. z also touches y at the boundary (given EC(y,z)). But y overlaps with x (given PO(x,y)), which means they share some interior points. If z is entirely within the interior of x, then the boundary of z (where y touches it) would be within the interior of x. This means y, which touches z at the boundary, would have to extend into the interior of x. This is consistent with PO(x,y), so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

OK, I'm satisfied with my reasoning now. The possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I realize that I may have missed some nuances. Let me clarify something. If I have a relation PO(x,y), it means that:
(a) x and y share some interior points
(b) Neither is a part of the other

And EC(y,z) means:
(a) y and z touch at their boundaries
(b) They don't share any interior points

Let me reconsider the case of TPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually, I think I might have been using a too strong condition. TPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. 

Let's imagine the following scenario. 
- We have region z. 
- Region x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z at some point.
- Region y is outside of z, but touches z at its boundary.
- Region x extends to the boundary of z at a different point than where y touches z.
- Region y extends to overlap with x, but this overlap is entirely within z.

In this scenario, we would have:
- TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z.
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points (inside z), but neither is a part of the other.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

Wait, let's think about this in more detail. If TPP(x,z), then x is entirely within z. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points. If EC(y,z), then y and z don't share any interior points; they only touch at the boundary.

If x is entirely within z, and x shares interior points with y, then y must have some interior points within z (the ones it shares with x). But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any interior points. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

And a similar argument shows that NTPP(x,z) is not possible either.

Ah, I think I understand the issue. I'm not being precise about what it means to be "inside" or "within."

Let's first define what it means for a region to be a proper part of another region. In the RCC-8 calculus, a region x is a proper part of a region z if all parts of x are also parts of z, but not vice versa. In particular, this means that all points in x are also in z, so x is contained within z.

Now, let's consider the case of TPP(x,z). If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z (i.e., x is contained within z) and x touches the boundary of z.

Since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. Since x is contained within z, these shared interior points are also in z. This means that y and z share some interior points, which contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any interior points.

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible. By a similar argument, NTPP(x,z) is not possible either.

OK, let's now consider TPPi(x,z).

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x (i.e., z is contained within x) and z touches the boundary of x.

Since EC(y,z), y touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z. Since z is contained within x, the boundary of z (where y touches it) is either within the interior of x or at the boundary of x.

If it's within the interior of x, then y, which touches z at the boundary, would have to extend into the interior of x. This means y and x share some interior points, which is consistent with PO(x,y).

If it's at the boundary of x, then y, which touches z at the boundary, could also touch x at the boundary or extend into the interior of x. Either way, this doesn't contradict PO(x,y), which says x and y share some interior points.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. The boundary of z (where y touches it) is within the interior of x. This means y, which touches z at the boundary, would have to extend into the interior of x. This is consistent with PO(x,y), so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me actually carefully re-check TPP and NTPP.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then all points in x are also in z. Since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. These shared interior points are also in z, which means y and z share some interior points. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any interior points.

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then all points in x are also in z. Since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. These shared interior points are also in z, which means y and z share some interior points. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any interior points.

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

With that, I've re-checked all the relations. Here's the final list of possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z):
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

Actually, let me re-check PO(x,z) again, because I think I may have made a mistake.

For PO(x,z), x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This means there are interior points of x that are not in z, and there are interior points of z that are not in x.

The interior points of x that are also in z must not be shared with y, because if they were, then y would have interior points in z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, the interior points that x shares with y must be among the interior points of x that are not in z.

OK, so x overlaps with y in some region, and x also overlaps with z in a different region. This doesn't lead to a contradiction, so PO(x,z) is possible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I realize I've been making a mistake in my thinking about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me try to be clearer. 

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then all interior points of x are also interior points of z. Since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. These shared interior points are also interior points of z, which means y and z share some interior points. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any interior points.

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then all interior points of x are also interior points of z. Since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. These shared interior points are also interior points of z, which means y and z share some interior points. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any interior points.

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I'm not being specific. Let me try to be even more precise.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z, i.e., all points of x are also points of z, and x touches the boundary of z. Given that PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. Since all points of x are also points of z, these shared interior points are also points of z. This means that y and z share some interior points. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says that y and z touch only at their boundaries and don't share any interior points.

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. The same contradiction arises, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

In contrast, for TPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. Since EC(y,z), y touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with z. Since all points of z are also points of x, the boundary of z (where y touches it) is either within the interior of x or at the boundary of x. Either way, this doesn't contradict PO(x,y), which says x and y share some interior points.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. The boundary of z (where y touches it) is within the interior of x. This means y, which touches z at the boundary, would have to extend into the interior of x. This is consistent with PO(x,y), so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let's just double-check once more, focusing on which regions have shared interior parts.

- PO(x,y): x and y have shared interior parts.
- EC(y,z): y and z do not have shared interior parts; they only touch at their boundaries.

Now, let's go through each RCC-8 relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This doesn't imply any shared interior parts between y and z, so it's consistent with the given relations. DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. This doesn't imply any shared interior parts between y and z, so it's consistent with the given relations. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other. This doesn't necessarily imply any shared interior parts between y and z, so it's consistent with the given relations. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then all interior parts of x are also interior parts of z. Since x and y share interior parts (given PO(x,y)), these shared interior parts are also interior parts of z. This means y and z share interior parts, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. The same contradiction as for TPP arises, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This doesn't necessarily imply any shared interior parts between y and z, so it's consistent with the given relations. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This doesn't necessarily imply any shared interior parts between y and z, so it's consistent with the given relations. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, then PO(x,y) implies PO(z,y), which contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

I'm pretty confident in this now, but let me double-check the case of PO(x,z).

For PO(x,z), x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This means there are interior points of x that are also interior points of z. But we also know that x and y share some interior points (given PO(x,y)), and y and z don't share any interior points (given EC(y,z)).

So, the interior points that x shares with z must be different from the interior points that x shares with y. This doesn't lead to a contradiction, so PO(x,z) is possible.

With that, I've re-checked all the relations again. Here's the final list of possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z):
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

Let me add in one final sanity check:

- PO(x,y): This means x and y share some interior points. It doesn't constrain how x relates to z directly.
- EC(y,z): This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior. It doesn't constrain how x relates to z directly, except via its interaction with the PO(x,y) relation.

From these, we've established that the relations where x is a proper part of z (TPP and NTPP) are not possible, because they would imply that y and z share interior points, which contradicts EC(y,z). Similarly, EQ(x,z) is not possible because it would imply that y has the same relation to z as it does to x, which isn't the case.

The remaining relations (DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi) don't introduce any contradictions, so they are all possible. Let's double-check that:

- DC(x,z): This just means x and z are disconnected. It doesn't constrain how x relates to y or how y relates to z, so it's consistent with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is possible.

- EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior. Again, it doesn't constrain how x relates to y or how y relates to z, so it's consistent with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). So EC(x,z) is possible.

- PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. If the interior points that x shares with z are different from the interior points that x shares with y, this is consistent with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is possible.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. The boundary of z (where y touches it) is either within the interior of x or at the boundary of x. Either way, this doesn't contradict PO(x,y) or EC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. The boundary of z (where y touches it) is within the interior of x. This is consistent with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, my final answer remains:
The possible relations between x and z, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

To summarize, we have five possible relations:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between regions x and z, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze what each given relation means:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is contained in the other
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, touching only at their boundaries with no shared interior

Now I'll examine each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Possible. Region x can overlap with parts of y that are completely separate from z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Possible. Region x can overlap with y and extend to touch z at its boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Possible. Region x can overlap with y and also share some interior points with z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Not possible. If x were completely contained in z, then the interior points that x shares with y (from PO(x,y)) would also be in z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Not possible, for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Possible. Region z can be contained within x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Possible. Region z can be completely contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible. If x and z were equal, then y would have to both partially overlap with z (because PO(x,y)) and be externally connected to z (because EC(y,z)), which is contradictory.
