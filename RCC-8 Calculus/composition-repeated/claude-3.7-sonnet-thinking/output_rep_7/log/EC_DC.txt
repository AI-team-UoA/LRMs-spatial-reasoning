PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

The question is asking: if EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's break down what we know:

1. EC(x,y): This means x and y are touching at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.

2. DC(y,z): This means y and z are disconnected; they don't share any parts.

Now, I need to determine what relationship(s) could exist between x and z.

Given that y and z are completely disconnected, and x touches y at the boundary, x and z could have various relationships:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could be touching at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal.

Let's think about each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is completely disconnected from z, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. x could touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part of its boundary, while y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x could partially overlap with z, while still touching y at the boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be a tangential proper part of z, while still touching y at the boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x is surrounded by z. However, x also touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z. This creates a contradiction because if x is inside z and touches y, then y must also have some relationship with z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be a tangential proper part of x, while x touches y at the boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while x touches y at a different part of its boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If x and z are equal, and x touches y at the boundary, then z must also touch y at the boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Hmm, on second thought, let me reason again through NTPP(x,z) and EQ(x,z):

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, then y must intersect with z. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and x touches y at the boundary, then z must also touch y at the boundary. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z) once more:

5. NTPP(x,z): Actually, here's a counterexample to my previous reasoning. Imagine x is a small circle, y is another circle touching x at its boundary, and z is a much larger circle completely containing x but not touching y. In this case, NTPP(x,z) holds, EC(x,y) holds, and DC(y,z) holds. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Now, let me reconsider EQ(x,z):

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and EC(x,y), then EC(z,y) must also hold. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me go through each possible relation once more to check my reasoning:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch y at the boundary, and z can be completely disconnected from both x and y.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part of its boundary, while y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with z, while still touching y at the boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): Actually, let me reconsider this. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and x touches y at the boundary, then y must also have some relationship with z (either touch or overlap). But this contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): I already reasoned that this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x, while x touches y at a different part of its boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while x touches y at its boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): I already reasoned that this is not possible.

I'm second-guessing myself about TPP(x,z) now. Let me try again:

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x touches z's boundary. Also, x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)). But if x touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then y and z might be connected, which contradicts DC(y,z). However, it's possible that x touches z's boundary at a different point than where it touches y's boundary. In that case, y and z can still be disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I'm still not sure about TPP(x,z). Let me reason more carefully:

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. And if EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. Now, if x touches both z's boundary and y's boundary, can y and z be disconnected?

Actually, I think the key is that x can touch z's boundary at one point and y's boundary at a different point. In that case, y and z can remain disconnected.

But there's another issue: If x is inside z and touches y, then y must intersect with the inside of z. But this means y and z would not be disconnected, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I'm still not completely convinced about my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me visualize it differently:

For TPP(x,z):
If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then y must penetrate into z to touch x. But this means y and z are not disconnected, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then y must penetrate deep into z to touch x. But this means y and z are not disconnected, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me go through the reasoning one more time:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch y at the boundary, and z can be completely disconnected from both x and y.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part of its boundary, while y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with z, while still touching y at the boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then y must penetrate into z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x is completely inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then y must penetrate into z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x, while x touches y at a different part of its boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while x touches y at its boundary, and y and z remain disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If x and z are equal, and x touches y at the boundary, then z must also touch y at the boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Let me double-check the reasoning by using concrete examples:

DC(x,z): Imagine three circles: x and y are touching at their boundaries, and z is completely separate.

EC(x,z): Imagine three circles: x is in the middle, touching y on the left and z on the right, while y and z are separate.

PO(x,z): Imagine x and z as overlapping circles, with x also touching y at a point outside of z.

TPP(x,z): If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then y must overlap with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So this is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then y must penetrate into z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So this is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): Imagine z as a small circle inside x, not touching x's boundary, and y as another circle touching x at its boundary but not overlapping with z.

NTPPi(x,z): Imagine z as a small circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and y as another circle touching x at its boundary but not overlapping with z.

EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and x touches y at the boundary, then z must also touch y at the boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z). So this is not possible.

Actually, let me rethink TPPi(x,z) with a visual:

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, or x contains z and z touches x's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. But if z touches x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, there's a possibility that z and y might touch, which would contradict DC(y,z). However, z can touch x's boundary at a point that's not where x touches y. In that case, y and z can remain disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

I'm becoming confused about my own reasoning. Let me recheck with more rigorous definitions:

- EC(x,y): The exteriors of x and y are disconnected, and the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y, but the interior of x does not intersect with the interior of y.

- DC(y,z): The exterior, interior, and boundary of y do not intersect with the exterior, interior, or boundary of z.

Now, if EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let me think step by step:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. The boundaries of x and y can intersect at a point, and z can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. The boundaries of x and y can intersect at one point, and the boundaries of x and z can intersect at another point, with y and z remaining disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can overlap partially, with the boundary of x intersecting with the boundary of y at a point outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of z. Also, the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y. If these intersection points are the same, then y and z would be connected, which contradicts DC(y,z). 

Wait, actually I think I'm being sloppy. Let's be more precise. 

TPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries. Now, if x is entirely inside z, and x touches y at the boundary, then y must penetrate into z to touch x. But this means y and z are not disconnected, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and x does not touch the boundary of z. If x is entirely inside z, and x touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), then y must penetrate into z to touch x. But this means y and z are not disconnected, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, there's a potential for z and y to be connected. However, z can touch x's boundary at a point that's not where x touches y. In that case, y and z can remain disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and z does not touch the boundary of x. If z is entirely inside x, and x touches y at the boundary, then z and y can remain disconnected as long as y does not penetrate deep into x to touch z. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. If x and z are identical, and x touches y at the boundary, then z must also touch y at the boundary. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me rethink about NTPP(x,z) and TPP(x,z):

I think my earlier statement that NTPP(x,z) and TPP(x,z) are not possible is incorrect. It's true that if x is inside z, and x touches y, then y and z have some relationship. But that doesn't necessarily mean y and z are connected.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, it's still possible for y and z to be disconnected. Imagine x as a small circle inside a larger circle z, touching z's boundary at one point. Now, imagine y as another circle outside of z, but touching x at the point where x touches z's boundary. In this case, y and z would be externally connected (EC), not disconnected. So, TPP(x,z) is not compatible with DC(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then y must penetrate into z to touch x. In this case, y and z would be overlapping, not disconnected. So, NTPP(x,z) is not compatible with DC(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, it means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If x touches y at the boundary, then y and z can be disconnected as long as z touches x's boundary at a point that's not where x touches y.

Ok, I think I've gone through each combination. Here's the final summary:

1. DC(x,z): Possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

But I want to double-check my reasoning once more for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) and x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), then y and z cannot be disconnected (DC(y,z)). This is because if x touches z's boundary and also touches y's boundary, then y and z would be at least externally connected (EC), not disconnected.

Let's think of a concrete example: if x is a small circle inside a larger circle z, touching z's boundary, and x also touches another circle y, then y and z would at least touch at the same point where x touches both of them. This contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)) and x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), then y and z cannot be disconnected (DC(y,z)). This is because if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then y must penetrate into z to touch x. This would make y and z overlapping, not disconnected. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): Disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): Externally connected.
3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me double-check TPPi(x,z):

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary. And if EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. 

If z touches x's boundary at the same point where x touches y, then y and z would be connected, contradicting DC(y,z). But z can touch x's boundary at a different point than where x touches y. In that case, y and z can remain disconnected.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible, but it requires that z touches x's boundary at a point that's not where x touches y.

And let me double-check NTPPi(x,z):

If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. And if EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary.

In this case, y and z can remain disconnected as long as y doesn't penetrate deep into x to touch z.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

Finally, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z): Disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): Externally connected.
3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So the answer is DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, that's 5 possible relations, let me triple-check each possibility to make sure I haven't made a mistake:

1. DC(x,z): Clearly possible. Imagine x and y as two circles touching at their boundaries, and z as a third circle completely separate from both.

2. EC(x,z): Clearly possible. Imagine x as a circle in the middle, touching y on the left and z on the right, with y and z being separate.

3. PO(x,z): Clearly possible. Imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, with x touching y at a point outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then y and z would be connected, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then y must penetrate into z to touch x, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. Imagine z as a small circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a point that's not where x touches y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. Imagine z as a small circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and y as another circle touching x at its boundary but not overlapping with z.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are equal, and x touches y at the boundary, then z must also touch y at the boundary, contradicting DC(y,z).

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Let me quadruple-check the reasoning for TPP(x,z), since I got confused about this earlier. 

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. And if EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. 

Now, if x touches z's boundary at a point p1, and x touches y's boundary at a point p2, then p1 and p2 could be the same point or different points.

If p1 and p2 are the same point, then y and z would also touch at that point, contradicting DC(y,z).

If p1 and p2 are different points, then y must penetrate into z to touch x at p2 (since x is inside z). But this would mean y and z are not disconnected, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Ok so in summary, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, I'm confused about TPPi(x,z) again. Let me think this through once more:

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary. And if EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary.

Now, if z touches x's boundary at a point p1, and x touches y's boundary at a point p2, then p1 and p2 could be the same point or different points.

If p1 and p2 are the same point, then z and y would also touch at that point, contradicting DC(y,z).

If p1 and p2 are different points, then z and y can remain disconnected.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible, but it requires that z touches x's boundary at a point that's not where x touches y.

Actually, I'm overthinking. Let me make a simple check:

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. In this case, z can be placed inside x such that it touches x's boundary at a point different from where x touches y. Then y and z would remain disconnected, consistent with DC(y,z).

So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. In this case, z can be placed well inside x, away from where x touches y. Then y and z would remain disconnected, consistent with DC(y,z).

So NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

Alright, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Now, let me also think about relation PO(x,z) one more time:

PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. If EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. 

In this case, y can touch x at a point that's outside of the region where x and z overlap. Then y and z would remain disconnected, consistent with DC(y,z).

So PO(x,z) is possible.

Ok, so, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Let's summarize all of them:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected. x and z don't share any parts.
2. EC(x,z): Externally connected. x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. x and z share some parts, but neither is entirely contained in the other.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

These are the possible relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

ANSWER:

I'll analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let me understand what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- DC(y,z): y and z are completely disconnected (no shared parts)

Possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch y at a boundary point while z is completely disconnected from both x and y.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part, while y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with z while touching y at a boundary point outside the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z): This is NOT possible. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then y would have to connect with z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is NOT possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then y would have to penetrate z to reach x, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be contained within x, touching x's boundary at a point different from where x touches y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) while x touches y at its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This is NOT possible. If x and z are identical, and x touches y, then z must also touch y, contradicting DC(y,z).
