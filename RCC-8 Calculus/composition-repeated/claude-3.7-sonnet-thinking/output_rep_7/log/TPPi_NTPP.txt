PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully work through this step by step.

We're given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze this systematically:

1. Could x and z be disconnected? DC(x,z)?
   If DC(x,z), then x and z share no points. But we know y is part of both x and z, which means x and z must share at least y. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. Could x and z be externally connected? EC(x,z)?
   If EC(x,z), then x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. However, y is in the interior of both x and z (since TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x, and NTPP(y,z) means y is inside z). So x and z must share interior points, making EC(x,z) impossible.

3. Could x and z partially overlap? PO(x,z)?
   This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. 
   We know y is inside both x and z. But the question is: could x and z overlap in such a way that neither contains the other completely?
   
   Since TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x (reverse), so y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   
   This means y is deeper inside z than it is in x (since it touches x's boundary but not z's). This suggests that z extends beyond y in all directions, while x might not.
   
   It's possible that x extends in some directions beyond z, making PO(x,z) a possibility.

4. Could x be a tangential proper part of z? TPP(x,z)?
   This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   
   Since TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
   Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   
   It's possible that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary (but not z's). This makes TPP(x,z) a possibility.

5. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z? NTPP(x,z)?
   This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   
   Given the constraints, it's possible that x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. This makes NTPP(x,z) a possibility.

6. Could z be a tangential proper part of x? TPP(z,x)?
   This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   
   Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. And since TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
   
   For z to be inside x, it would have to be the case that y touches x's boundary, z contains y, and z also touches x's boundary. This is geometrically consistent, making TPP(z,x) a possibility.

7. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x? NTPP(z,x)?
   This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   
   Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. And since TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
   
   If y touches x's boundary and z contains y, then z must extend at least to the boundary of x where y touches it. This contradicts the definition of NTPP(z,x), which requires z to not touch x's boundary. So NTPP(z,x) is impossible.

8. Could x and z be equal? EQ(x,z)?
   This would mean x and z occupy the exact same space.
   
   Since TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x (not equal to x).
   Since NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z (not equal to z).
   
   If x and z were equal, then y would have to be a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)) and a non-tangential proper part of z (from NTPP(y,z)). But if x and z are the same, this is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

To summarize:
- DC(x,z): Impossible
- EC(x,z): Impossible
- PO(x,z): Possible
- TPP(x,z): Possible
- NTPP(x,z): Possible
- TPP(z,x): Possible
- NTPP(z,x): Impossible
- EQ(x,z): Impossible

Hmm, I think I need to check my reasoning on some of these cases, especially TPP(z,x). Let me double-check.

For TPP(z,x), I said:
"For z to be inside x, it would have to be the case that y touches x's boundary, z contains y, and z also touches x's boundary. This is geometrically consistent, making TPP(z,x) a possibility."

But let's think more carefully. 
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, if z were to be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)), then z would be inside x and touch x's boundary. But NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. 

Let's visualize this: If z touches x's boundary and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y can't also touch x's boundary (which is what TPPi(x,y) requires). So TPP(z,x) seems to lead to a contradiction with the given constraints.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider from the beginning.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's systematically evaluate each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If y is part of both x and z, then x and z must share at least y. So x and z cannot be disconnected. DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   If y is part of both x and z, then x and z must share at least y, which is an interior point. So x and z cannot be just externally connected. EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is geometrically consistent with the given constraints. We know y is inside both x and z. It's possible that some parts of x are outside z, and some parts of z are outside x. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is also geometrically consistent. It's possible that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary (but not z's boundary, as required by NTPP(y,z)). So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is geometrically consistent as well. It's possible that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Given that:
   - TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

   If z were to be inside x, then z would have to contain y (from NTPP(y,z)). But if y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), and z contains y, and y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), then z must extend beyond the boundary point of x that y touches. This contradicts the assumption that z is inside x. 

   Let me try to explain this more clearly:
   - y touches x's boundary at some point p.
   - z contains y.
   - y does not touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)).
   - This means point p, which is on x's boundary, must be strictly inside z.
   - But if p is strictly inside z, then z extends beyond x at point p, which contradicts the assumption that z is inside x.

   So TPP(z,x) is impossible.

7. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y can't touch x's boundary. But TPPi(x,y) says y does touch x's boundary. So NTPP(z,x) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same, then TPPi(x,y) implies TPPi(z,y), which contradicts NTPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

To summarize the revised analysis:
- DC(x,z): Impossible
- EC(x,z): Impossible
- PO(x,z): Possible
- TPP(x,z): Possible
- NTPP(x,z): Possible
- TPP(z,x): Impossible
- NTPP(z,x): Impossible
- EQ(x,z): Impossible

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, or NTPP.

But let me revisit my reasoning for TPP(z,x) to make sure I've got it right.

TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, if z were to be inside x (as TPP(z,x) would require), and y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), then y would also be inside x. This part is consistent.

If y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), then z must extend beyond the point where y touches x's boundary. But if z extends beyond x's boundary, then z can't be inside x.

Hmm, I'm not sure this reasoning is water-tight. Let me try a different approach using the formal properties of these relations.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's approach this more systematically using the composition table for RCC-8 relations. The composition table tells us what relations are possible between two regions given their relations to a third region.

If we denote the composition of two relations R and S as R ○ S, then we want to find TPPi ○ NTPP.

From the RCC-8 composition table, TPPi ○ NTPP = {PO, TPP, NTPP}.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I think this is the correct answer based on the composition table for RCC-8 relations. Let me double-check my reasoning just to be sure.

Actually, let me derive this more explicitly without relying on the composition table, just to confirm.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is properly inside x (not equal to x) and touches x's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is properly inside z (not equal to z) and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's exhaustively check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If y is part of both x and z, then x and z must share at least y. So x and z cannot be disconnected. DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   If y is part of both x and z, then x and z must share at least y, which is an interior point of both. So x and z cannot be just externally connected. EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is geometrically consistent. We know y is inside both x and z. It's possible that some parts of x are outside z, and some parts of z are outside x. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is geometrically consistent. It's possible that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary (but not z's boundary, as required by NTPP(y,z)). So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is geometrically consistent. It's possible that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. From NTPP(y,z), we know y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If z touches x's boundary at some point p, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y is not at point p. But from TPPi(x,y), we know y touches x's boundary at some point q. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, point q must be inside z. But if point q is on x's boundary and inside z, then z must extend beyond x at point q, which contradicts the assumption that z is inside x. So TPP(z,x) is impossible.

7. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. From TPPi(x,y), we know y touches x's boundary. But from NTPP(y,z), we know y is inside z. If y is inside z and z doesn't touch x's boundary, then y can't touch x's boundary, which contradicts TPPi(x,y). So NTPP(z,x) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same, then TPPi(x,y) implies TPPi(z,y), which contradicts NTPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I'm now confident in this answer. To check my reasoning for case 6 (TPP(z,x)), let me explain visually:

If TPP(z,x), then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If NTPP(y,z), then y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If TPPi(x,y), then y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

So y touches x's boundary at some point p. Since y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, point p must be inside z. But if p is on x's boundary and inside z, then z must extend beyond x at point p, which contradicts the assumption that z is inside x.

This reasoning seems sound, so I'm confident that TPP(z,x) is impossible.

Similarly, for case 7 (NTPP(z,x)):

If NTPP(z,x), then z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If TPPi(x,y), then y is inside x and touches x's boundary. If NTPP(y,z), then y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So y touches x's boundary at some point p. But if y is inside z and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then y cannot touch x's boundary, which contradicts TPPi(x,y). So NTPP(z,x) is impossible.

OK, so the answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me be absolutely clear with the definitions once more:

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is properly inside x (y is a proper part of x) and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is properly inside z (y is a proper part of z) and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's exhaustively go through each RCC-8 relation for (x,z):

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, meaning they don't share any points.
   But we know y is part of both x (from TPPi(x,y)) and z (from NTPP(y,z)), so x and z must share at least the points in y. Thus, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
   But we know y is an interior part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points. Thus, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some parts but neither is completely contained in the other.
   This is geometrically consistent. We know y is part of both x and z, so they share at least y. But it's possible that some parts of x are not in z, and some parts of z are not in x. Thus, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   This is geometrically consistent. It's possible that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary (but not z's boundary, as required by NTPP(y,z)). Thus, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   This is geometrically consistent. It's possible that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while y is inside x and touches x's boundary. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   Here I need to be careful:
   - TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   
   If z were inside x and touching x's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would be strictly inside z and away from z's boundary. But we know y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)). 
   
   Let's examine this further: Suppose there's a point p on x's boundary that y touches. From NTPP(y,z), y doesn't touch z's boundary, so p is not on z's boundary. If p is on x's boundary but not on z's boundary, and z is inside x, then p must be strictly inside z. But if p is strictly inside z, then z extends beyond x at point p, contradicting the assumption that z is inside x.
   
   So TPP(z,x) is impossible.

7. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   If z is inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y is also inside x without touching x's boundary. But from TPPi(x,y), we know y touches x's boundary. This is a contradiction, so NTPP(z,x) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same, then TPPi(x,y) implies TPPi(z,y), which contradicts NTPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

OK, I've checked my reasoning now from multiple angles, and I keep arriving at the same answer. So I believe the correct answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

ANSWER:

Looking at our given relations:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible - x and z must share at least y, so they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible - x and z share y, which is an interior part of both, so they cannot be merely externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap, with y in their shared region.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPP(z,x): Impossible - If z were inside x and y touches x's boundary (per TPPi(x,y)), but y doesn't touch z's boundary (per NTPP(y,z)), this creates a contradiction at the boundary point.

7. NTPP(z,x): Impossible - If z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (which is inside z) couldn't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible - If x and z were identical, y couldn't be both tangential to x and non-tangential to z.
