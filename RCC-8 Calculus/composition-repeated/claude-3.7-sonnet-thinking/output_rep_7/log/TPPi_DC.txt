PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, I'll understand what TPPi(x,y) means: This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.

Second, DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't even touch at their boundaries.

Now, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given these constraints.

Since y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is disconnected from z (from DC(y,z)), there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being completely contained in the other.

I believe these are the only possibilities because:
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is contained in z, which doesn't seem possible because part of x (specifically, y) is disconnected from z.
- NTPP(x,z) would also mean x is contained in z, which isn't possible for the same reason.
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. This might be possible, but I need to think more about it.
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. This might also be possible, but I need to consider it further.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same, which isn't possible because y is part of x but disconnected from z.

Actually, let's think about this more carefully. 

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x can be completely disconnected from z, with y inside x and also disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch z at the boundary, while y is inside x and disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y being in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But this conflicts with TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) because if x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But this also conflicts with TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) for the same reason as above. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible as long as z doesn't overlap with y (since y and z are disconnected).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is also possible as long as z doesn't overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. But this conflicts with TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) because if x and z are the same, and y is part of x, then y would be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to be careful about the definitions. Let me rethink:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. It means y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't even touch at their boundaries.

Let me reason through each of the 8 possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. If x contains y (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is disconnected from z (from DC(y,z)), then x can be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible. x can touch z at the boundary, while y (which is inside x and touches x's boundary) can still be disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x and z can share some interior parts, as long as y (which is inside x) is not in the overlapping region (since y and z are disconnected).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is inside z, and y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)), then y would be inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x is inside z, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible as long as z doesn't overlap with y (since y and z are disconnected). z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, while y is also inside x (and touches x's boundary at a different location) but is disconnected from z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible as long as z doesn't overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. But if x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), then y would be a proper part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check each of these:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. x can be disconnected from z, with y inside x and also disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible. x can touch z at the boundary, while y is inside x and disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x and z can share some interior parts, as long as y (which is inside x) is not in the overlapping region.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible as long as z doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible as long as z doesn't overlap with y.

So, the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

But wait, let me think more carefully about TPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Now, we know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't even touch at their boundaries.

If both y and z are tangential proper parts of x, they both touch x's boundary. But they are disconnected from each other. This is a valid configuration.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z):

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

With TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), z can be inside x without touching x's boundary, and still be disconnected from y. This is also a valid configuration.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to analyze what TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) tell us about the possible relationships between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x - so y is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected - they share no parts and don't even touch at their boundaries.

Let me determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can touch z at a boundary while y remains disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap with z, as long as the overlapping region doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible - if x were inside z, then y would also be inside z (contradicting DC(y,z)).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be contained in x and touch x's boundary while remaining disconnected from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be completely contained in x without touching y.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x and z were equal, y would need to be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
