PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

We're given that:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP, so TPP(z,y). This means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

So we have that both x and z are inside y and both touch y's boundary. What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Given these constraints, there are several possibilities for how x and z could relate to each other:

1. x and z could be completely disconnected (DC) - they don't share any points. This could happen if they touch different parts of y's boundary and don't overlap.

2. x and z could be externally connected (EC) - they touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap. This could happen if they touch the same part of y's boundary.

3. x and z could partially overlap (PO) - they share some points, but neither is completely contained in the other.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP). This could happen if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP). This could happen if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi). This could happen if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi). This could happen if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. x and z could be equal (EQ) - they occupy exactly the same space.

Let's check each of these possibilities to see if they're consistent with the given constraints.

1. DC(x,z): Both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. It's possible that they touch different parts of y's boundary and don't overlap, so DC is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): Both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. It's possible that they touch each other at their boundaries, so EC is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): Both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. It's possible that they partially overlap, so PO is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since z is inside y and touches y's boundary, x would also be inside y and, because it touches z's boundary which in turn touches y's boundary, x would also touch y's boundary. So TPP is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since z is inside y and touches y's boundary, x would also be inside y but, because it doesn't touch z's boundary, it wouldn't touch y's boundary. But this contradicts the given constraint that TPP(x,y), which means x touches y's boundary. So NTPP is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Since x is inside y and touches y's boundary, z would also be inside y. However, since z touches x's boundary, which in turn touches y's boundary, z would also touch y's boundary. So TPPi is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside y and touches y's boundary, z would also be inside y. However, since z doesn't touch x's boundary, it wouldn't touch y's boundary. But this contradicts the given constraint that TPPi(y,z), which means z touches y's boundary. So NTPPi is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z occupy exactly the same space. Since both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary, this is consistent with the given constraints. So EQ is a possible relation.

Actually, let me think a bit more about cases 5 and 7. There could be more subtlety that I'm missing.

For case 5, NTPP(x,z), I've assumed that if x doesn't touch z's boundary, then it doesn't touch y's boundary. But that's not necessarily true. It's possible that x touches y's boundary at a point where z doesn't. So let me reconsider if NTPP(x,z) is possible.

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since TPP(x,y), we know x touches y's boundary. Since TPPi(y,z), we know z touches y's boundary. So x and z both touch y's boundary. But if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, how can x touch y's boundary? It would need to reach through z to touch y's boundary, which contradicts the definition of NTPP. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not a possible relation.

Similarly for case 7, NTPPi(x,z), I've assumed that if z doesn't touch x's boundary, then it doesn't touch y's boundary. But let me reconsider.

If NTPPi(x,z), then z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since TPPi(y,z), we know z touches y's boundary. Since TPP(x,y), we know x touches y's boundary. So x and z both touch y's boundary. But if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, how can z touch y's boundary? It would need to reach through x to touch y's boundary, which contradicts the definition of NTPP. So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Wait, hold on, I'm concerned I might not be using the definitions properly. Let me double-check some things:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, and there's at least one point where x's boundary touches y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y, and there's at least one point where z's boundary touches y's boundary.

So both x and z are completely inside y, and both touch y's boundary at least at one point.

Let's reconsider each possible relationship:

1. DC(x,z): Since both x and z are completely inside y, they must be contained within y's interior. But for x and z to be disconnected, they would need to be separated by some region within y's interior. This seems plausible, so DC remains a possible relation.

Wait, actually, let me draw this out. 

y is a region, and x and z are both completely inside y. Both x and z touch y's boundary at least at one point. If DC(x,z), then x and z don't share any points. This means there's a gap between them. But both are inside y, so this gap is filled with points that are in y but neither in x nor in z. This seems plausible. So DC remains a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): Since both x and z are completely inside y and both touch y's boundary, it's possible that they touch each other at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is plausible, so EC remains a possible relation.

Actually, let's draw this out too. If x and z touch at their boundaries, they could each also touch y's boundary at other points. This seems plausible. So EC remains a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): Since both x and z are completely inside y and both touch y's boundary, it's possible that they partially overlap. This is plausible, so PO remains a possible relation.

Drawing this out: x and z can overlap in their interiors, and each can also have parts that aren't in the other, and each can touch y's boundary. This seems plausible. So PO remains a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, x would also be completely inside y. Since x touches z's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, it's possible that x touches y's boundary at the same point where z does. This is plausible, so TPP remains a possible relation.

Drawing this out: x is completely inside z, and x touches z's boundary. z is completely inside y, and z touches y's boundary. If x touches z's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary, then x would also touch y's boundary. This seems plausible. So TPP remains a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, x would also be completely inside y. But since x doesn't touch z's boundary, it wouldn't touch y's boundary. But this contradicts the given constraint that TPP(x,y), which means x touches y's boundary. So NTPP is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Since x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, z would also be completely inside y. Since z touches x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible that z touches y's boundary at the same point where x does. This is plausible, so TPPi remains a possible relation.

Drawing this out: z is completely inside x, and z touches x's boundary. x is completely inside y, and x touches y's boundary. If z touches x's boundary at the point where x touches y's boundary, then z would also touch y's boundary. This seems plausible. So TPPi remains a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary, z would also be completely inside y. But since z doesn't touch x's boundary, it wouldn't touch y's boundary. But this contradicts the given constraint that TPPi(y,z), which means z touches y's boundary. So NTPPi is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z occupy exactly the same space. Since both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary, this is consistent with the given constraints. So EQ remains a possible relation.

Drawing this out: If x and z occupy the same space, they would both be inside y and touch y's boundary at the same points. This seems plausible. So EQ remains a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

OK, let me carefully double-check the constraints again.

TPP(x, y) means that:
1. x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is a part of y and x is not equal to y)
2. x is tangential to y (i.e., x's boundary intersects with y's boundary)

TPPi(y, z) means that TPP(z, y), which means that:
1. z is a proper part of y (i.e., z is a part of y and z is not equal to y)
2. z is tangential to y (i.e., z's boundary intersects with y's boundary)

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This means x and z are disconnected, sharing no points. This can happen if x and z are in different parts of y, both touching y's boundary at different points. This is consistent with the constraints, so DC is a possible relation.

2. EC(x, z): This means x and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but their interiors are disjoint. This can happen if x and z touch at their boundaries and both also touch y's boundary at some points. This is consistent with the constraints, so EC is a possible relation.

3. PO(x, z): This means x and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This can happen if x and z overlap and both also touch y's boundary at some points. This is consistent with the constraints, so PO is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x, z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x's boundary intersects with z's boundary. Given that TPP(x, y) and TPP(z, y), can x be a tangential proper part of z?

If x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of y, then x is a proper part of y (by transitivity). If x touches z's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, then x can also touch y's boundary at the same point where z does. This is consistent with the constraints, so TPP is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x, z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x's boundary does not intersect with z's boundary. Given that TPP(x, y) and TPP(z, y), can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?

If x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of y, then x is a proper part of y (by transitivity). But if x doesn't touch z's boundary, how can it touch y's boundary? It would need to "reach through" z to touch y's boundary, which isn't possible. So x can't be a non-tangential proper part of z. Thus, NTPP is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x, z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a proper part of x and z's boundary intersects with x's boundary. Given that TPP(x, y) and TPP(z, y), can z be a tangential proper part of x?

If z is a proper part of x, and x is a proper part of y, then z is a proper part of y (by transitivity). If z touches x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then z can also touch y's boundary at the same point where x does. This is consistent with the constraints, so TPPi is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a proper part of x and z's boundary does not intersect with x's boundary. Given that TPP(x, y) and TPP(z, y), can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?

If z is a proper part of x, and x is a proper part of y, then z is a proper part of y (by transitivity). But if z doesn't touch x's boundary, how can it touch y's boundary? It would need to "reach through" x to touch y's boundary, which isn't possible. So z can't be a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, NTPPi is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x, z): This means x and z are equal, i.e., they occupy the same space. Given that TPP(x, y) and TPP(z, y), can x and z be equal?

If x and z are equal, and x is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary, then z is also a proper part of y that touches y's boundary. This is consistent with the constraints, so EQ is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me reconsider a couple of cases here to make sure I haven't been tripped up by the fact that we're talking about regions (rather than, e.g., mereology for solid objects).

Let's be precise about TPP:

TPP(x,y) means:
1. x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y)
2. x's boundary intersects with y's boundary (but x's interior doesn't)

Now, given:
- TPP(x,y)
- TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y)

Let's consider if NTPP(x,z) is possible. This would mean:
1. x is a proper part of z (x⊂z, x≠z)
2. x's boundary is entirely within z (meaning it doesn't touch z's boundary)

Given that x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of y, then x is also a proper part of y (by transitivity). But if x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary, it cannot touch y's boundary (because z's boundary is the interface between z and y). This contradicts the given TPP(x,y), which states that x's boundary does touch y's boundary.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let's also double-check if NTPPi(x,z) is possible. This would mean:
1. z is a proper part of x (z⊂x, z≠x)
2. z's boundary is entirely within x (meaning it doesn't touch x's boundary)

Given that z is a proper part of x, and x is a proper part of y, then z is also a proper part of y (by transitivity). But if z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary, it cannot touch y's boundary (because x's boundary is the interface between x and y). This contradicts the given TPP(z,y), which states that z's boundary does touch y's boundary.

Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

I have confirmed that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me double-check the plausibility of TPP(x, z) and TPPi(x, z).

For TPP(x, z):
1. x is a proper part of z (x⊂z, x≠z)
2. x's boundary intersects with z's boundary

If z is a proper part of y (z⊂y, z≠y) and x is a proper part of z (x⊂z, x≠z), then x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y). This satisfies the first condition of TPP(x,y).

For the second condition, we need x's boundary to intersect with y's boundary. If x's boundary intersects with z's boundary, and z's boundary intersects with y's boundary, can we guarantee that x's boundary intersects with y's boundary?

Not necessarily. The intersection of x's boundary with z's boundary, and the intersection of z's boundary with y's boundary, might be disjoint sets. In other words, x might touch z at a different part of z's boundary than where z touches y.

However, if x's boundary intersects with z's boundary at a point that also lies on y's boundary, then x's boundary would also intersect with y's boundary. This would satisfy the second condition of TPP(x,y).

So, TPP(x, z) is a possible relation, but it requires x to touch z at a point on z's boundary that also lies on y's boundary.

For TPPi(x, z) (which is the same as TPP(z, x)):
1. z is a proper part of x (z⊂x, z≠x)
2. z's boundary intersects with x's boundary

If x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y) and z is a proper part of x (z⊂x, z≠x), then z is a proper part of y (z⊂y, z≠y). This satisfies the first condition of TPP(z,y).

For the second condition, we need z's boundary to intersect with y's boundary. If z's boundary intersects with x's boundary, and x's boundary intersects with y's boundary, can we guarantee that z's boundary intersects with y's boundary?

Not necessarily. The intersection of z's boundary with x's boundary, and the intersection of x's boundary with y's boundary, might be disjoint sets. In other words, z might touch x at a different part of x's boundary than where x touches y.

However, if z's boundary intersects with x's boundary at a point that also lies on y's boundary, then z's boundary would also intersect with y's boundary. This would satisfy the second condition of TPP(z,y).

So, TPPi(x, z) is a possible relation, but it requires z to touch x at a point on x's boundary that also lies on y's boundary.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Wait, I should double-check my understanding of the problem statement again.

We have:
- TPP(x, y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y, z): This is the inverse of TPP, so TPP(z, y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, both x and z are tangential proper parts of y.

Let's now carefully consider if TPP(x, z) is a possible relation.

If TPP(x, z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. x is a proper part of z (x⊂z, x≠z)
2. x's boundary intersects with z's boundary

Now, we know that z is a proper part of y (z⊂y, z≠y). By transitivity, if x is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y).

For TPP(x, y), we also need x's boundary to intersect with y's boundary. If x's boundary intersects with z's boundary, and z's boundary intersects with y's boundary, can x's boundary intersect with y's boundary?

The intersection of x's boundary with z's boundary doesn't necessarily overlap with the intersection of z's boundary with y's boundary. But for TPP(x, y) to hold, we need x's boundary to intersect with y's boundary somewhere.

One way this could happen is if x's boundary intersects with z's boundary at a point that also lies on y's boundary. In this case, x's boundary would directly intersect with y's boundary, satisfying the condition for TPP(x, y).

Another possibility is that x's boundary intersects with y's boundary at a point that doesn't lie on z's boundary. But this would mean that x's boundary extends beyond z to touch y, which contradicts the assumption that x is a proper part of z (since a proper part is fully contained within).

So, for TPP(x, z) to be consistent with TPP(x, y), x must touch z at a point on z's boundary that also lies on y's boundary. This is a special configuration, but it's possible.

Let's check if TPPi(x, z) is a possible relation.

If TPPi(x, z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. z is a proper part of x (z⊂x, z≠x)
2. z's boundary intersects with x's boundary

Now, we know that x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y). By transitivity, if z is a proper part of x, then z is a proper part of y (z⊂y, z≠y).

For TPP(z, y) (which is what TPPi(y, z) means), we also need z's boundary to intersect with y's boundary. If z's boundary intersects with x's boundary, and x's boundary intersects with y's boundary, can z's boundary intersect with y's boundary?

The intersection of z's boundary with x's boundary doesn't necessarily overlap with the intersection of x's boundary with y's boundary. But for TPP(z, y) to hold, we need z's boundary to intersect with y's boundary somewhere.

One way this could happen is if z's boundary intersects with x's boundary at a point that also lies on y's boundary. In this case, z's boundary would directly intersect with y's boundary, satisfying the condition for TPP(z, y).

Another possibility is that z's boundary intersects with y's boundary at a point that doesn't lie on x's boundary. But this would mean that z's boundary extends beyond x to touch y, which contradicts the assumption that z is a proper part of x (since a proper part is fully contained within).

So, for TPPi(x, z) to be consistent with TPP(z, y), z must touch x at a point on x's boundary that also lies on y's boundary. This is a special configuration, but it's possible.

Actually, let me reconsider yet again. Let's be careful about the precise meaning of TPP. There's a condition that x's boundary intersects with y's boundary, but doesn't contain all of y's boundary (because then x would equal y, which is not allowed).

Given:
- TPP(x, y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z, or equivalently, TPP(z, y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

The plausible spatial relations between x and z are:

1. DC(x, z): This means x and z are disconnected, sharing no points. This can happen if x and z are in different parts of y, both touching y's boundary at different points. This is consistent with the constraints, so DC is a possible relation.

2. EC(x, z): This means x and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but their interiors are disjoint. This can happen if x and z touch at their boundaries and both also touch y's boundary at some points. This is consistent with the constraints, so EC is a possible relation.

3. PO(x, z): This means x and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This can happen if x and z overlap and both also touch y's boundary at some points. This is consistent with the constraints, so PO is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x, z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x's boundary intersects with z's boundary. For this to be consistent with TPP(x, y) and TPP(z, y), x must touch z at a point on z's boundary that also lies on y's boundary. This is a specific configuration, but it's possible. So TPP is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x, z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x's boundary does not intersect with z's boundary. If x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary, it cannot touch y's boundary (because z's boundary is the interface between z and y). This contradicts the given TPP(x, y), which states that x's boundary does touch y's boundary. So NTPP is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x, z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a proper part of x and z's boundary intersects with x's boundary. For this to be consistent with TPP(x, y) and TPP(z, y), z must touch x at a point on x's boundary that also lies on y's boundary. This is a specific configuration, but it's possible. So TPPi is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a proper part of x and z's boundary does not intersect with x's boundary. If z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary, it cannot touch y's boundary (because x's boundary is the interface between x and y). This contradicts the given TPP(z, y), which states that z's boundary does touch y's boundary. So NTPPi is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x, z): This means x and z are equal, i.e., they occupy the same space. If x and z are equal, and x is a tangential proper part of y, then z is also a tangential proper part of y. This is consistent with the constraints, so EQ is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Let me think through the plausibility of TPP(x, z) and TPPi(x, z) again. In the context of spatial regions, I think we need to be extra careful here.

For TPP(x, z):
1. x is a proper part of z (x⊂z, x≠z)
2. x's boundary intersects with z's boundary

If TPP(z, y), then z is a proper part of y (z⊂y, z≠y) and z's boundary intersects with y's boundary. If x is a proper part of z (x⊂z, x≠z), then by transitivity, x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y).

Now, for TPP(x, y), we also need x's boundary to intersect with y's boundary. If x's boundary intersects with z's boundary, and z's boundary intersects with y's boundary, can x's boundary intersect with y's boundary?

Let's think about the spatial configuration: z is inside y, and z touches y's boundary. x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. For x to also touch y's boundary, x would need to touch z at a point where z touches y. Is this possible? 

Yes, it's possible. Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at point P, and x as an even smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary also at point P. In this configuration, x, z, and y all meet at point P. So x's boundary does intersect with y's boundary, satisfying the condition for TPP(x, y).

Therefore, TPP(x, z) is a possible relation.

For TPPi(x, z) (which is the same as TPP(z, x)):
1. z is a proper part of x (z⊂x, z≠x)
2. z's boundary intersects with x's boundary

If TPP(x, y), then x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y) and x's boundary intersects with y's boundary. If z is a proper part of x (z⊂x, z≠x), then by transitivity, z is a proper part of y (z⊂y, z≠y).

Now, for TPP(z, y), we also need z's boundary to intersect with y's boundary. If z's boundary intersects with x's boundary, and x's boundary intersects with y's boundary, can z's boundary intersect with y's boundary?

Let's think about the spatial configuration: x is inside y, and x touches y's boundary. z is inside x, and z touches x's boundary. For z to also touch y's boundary, z would need to touch x at a point where x touches y. Is this possible?

Yes, it's possible. Imagine y as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary at point P, and z as an even smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary also at point P. In this configuration, z, x, and y all meet at point P. So z's boundary does intersect with y's boundary, satisfying the condition for TPP(z, y).

Therefore, TPPi(x, z) is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

So my final answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me triple-check these.

We have TPP(x, y) and TPPi(y, z). This means:
- x is a tangential proper part of y
- y is a tangential proper part of z (or equivalently, z is a tangential proper part of y, TPP(z, y))

Wait, I've been assuming TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which isn't what the question says.

Let's be super clear: TPPi(y, z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

So we have:
- TPP(x, y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- TPPi(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z

This means:
- x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y) and x's boundary intersects with y's boundary
- y is a proper part of z (y⊂z, y≠z) and y's boundary intersects with z's boundary

OK, I was wrong. Let's re-derive the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- TPP(x, y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- TPPi(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z

This means:
- x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y) and x's boundary intersects with y's boundary
- y is a proper part of z (y⊂z, y≠z) and y's boundary intersects with z's boundary

Now let's consider each of the 8 possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This means x and z are disconnected, sharing no points. But if x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z (by transitivity). So x and z share points, and they cannot be disconnected. Thus, DC is not a possible relation.

2. EC(x, z): This means x and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but their interiors are disjoint. But if x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. So x's interior must be contained within z's interior, and they cannot be externally connected. Thus, EC is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x, z): This means x and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. But if x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. So x must be entirely contained within z, and they cannot partially overlap. Thus, PO is not a possible relation.

4. TPP(x, z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x's boundary intersects with z's boundary. If x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. But for x to be a tangential proper part of z, x's boundary must intersect with z's boundary. 

Let's think about the spatial configuration: y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary. x is inside y, and x touches y's boundary. Does x necessarily touch z's boundary? Not always. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x wouldn't touch z's boundary.

But it's also possible for x to touch y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, in which case x would also touch z's boundary. In this configuration, TPP(x, z) would be satisfied.

Therefore, TPP(x, z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x, z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x's boundary does not intersect with z's boundary. If x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. But for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x's boundary must not intersect with z's boundary.

Let's think about the spatial configuration: y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary. x is inside y, and x touches y's boundary. As I mentioned above, if x touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x wouldn't touch z's boundary.

In this configuration, NTPP(x, z) would be satisfied.

Therefore, NTPP(x, z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x, z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a proper part of x and z's boundary intersects with x's boundary. But if y is a part of z, and x is a part of y, then z cannot be a part of x (this would create a cyclic dependency, which is not allowed in a part-of relation). Thus, TPPi is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a proper part of x and z's boundary does not intersect with x's boundary. But if y is a part of z, and x is a part of y, then z cannot be a part of x (this would create a cyclic dependency, which is not allowed in a part-of relation). Thus, NTPPi is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x, z): This means x and z are equal, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space. But if x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z. Since a proper part is strictly smaller than the whole, x and z cannot be equal. Thus, EQ is not a possible relation.

Actually I need to double-check some of the deductions here, especially EQ. 

Let's be precise about the part-of relation. If x is a proper part of y, then x⊂y and x≠y. Similarly, if y is a proper part of z, then y⊂z and y≠z. By transitivity, we have x⊂y⊂z, which means x⊂z. Since x≠y and y≠z, we must have x≠z. So x is a proper part of z, and EQ is indeed not a possible relation.

Now let's revisit my deductions regarding TPP and NTPP.

For TPP(x, z):
- x is a proper part of z (x⊂z, x≠z), which follows from x⊂y⊂z and x≠z.
- x's boundary intersects with z's boundary. This is not guaranteed by the given constraints. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x wouldn't touch z's boundary.

But it's also possible for x to touch y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, in which case x would also touch z's boundary. In this configuration, TPP(x, z) would be satisfied.

Therefore, TPP(x, z) is a possible relation.

For NTPP(x, z):
- x is a proper part of z (x⊂z, x≠z), which follows from x⊂y⊂z and x≠z.
- x's boundary does not intersect with z's boundary. This is not guaranteed by the given constraints, but it's a possible configuration. If x touches y's boundary at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x wouldn't touch z's boundary.

In this configuration, NTPP(x, z) would be satisfied.

Therefore, NTPP(x, z) is a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are TPP and NTPP.

Let me double-check all other cases again:

1. DC(x, z): This would mean x and z share no points. But if x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. So x and z must share points, and DC is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors are disjoint. But if x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. So x's interior must be contained within z's interior, and EC is not possible.

3. PO(x, z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, sharing some but not all points. But if x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. So x must be entirely contained within z, and PO is not possible.

4. TPP(x, z): As discussed, this is a possible relation if x touches z's boundary, which can happen if x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x, z): As discussed, this is a possible relation if x doesn't touch z's boundary, which can happen if x touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x, z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But if y is a part of z, and x is a part of y, then z cannot be a part of x (this would create a cyclic dependency, which is not allowed in a part-of relation). So TPPi is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But if y is a part of z, and x is a part of y, then z cannot be a part of x (for the same reason as above). So NTPPi is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): This would mean x and z are equal. But if x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z. Since a proper part is strictly smaller than the whole, x and z cannot be equal. So EQ is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP and NTPP.

Wait, I need to make sure I'm interpreting TPPi(y, z) correctly. Let me revisit the problem statement.

TPPi(y, z) is the inverse of TPP(y, z), which means TPP(z, y). So TPPi(y, z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
- TPP(x, y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- TPPi(y, z): z is a tangential proper part of y

This means:
- x is a proper part of y (x⊂y, x≠y) and x's boundary intersects with y's boundary
- z is a proper part of y (z⊂y, z≠z) and z's boundary intersects with y's boundary

So both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. Let's now reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This means x and z are disconnected, sharing no points. This can happen if x and z are in different parts of y, both touching y's boundary at different points. This is consistent with the constraints, so DC is a possible relation.

2. EC(x, z): This means x and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but their interiors are disjoint. This can happen if x and z touch at their boundaries and both also touch y's boundary at some points. This is consistent with the constraints, so EC is a possible relation.

3. PO(x, z): This means x and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. This can happen if x and z overlap and both also touch y's boundary at some points. This is consistent with the constraints, so PO is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x, z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x's boundary intersects with z's boundary. This can happen if x is contained within z, and x touches z's boundary at a point. Both x and z can still touch y's boundary, satisfying the constraints. So TPP is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x, z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and x's boundary does not intersect with z's boundary. If x doesn't touch z's boundary, how can it touch y's boundary? It would need to "reach through" z to touch y's boundary, which isn't possible. So NTPP is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x, z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a proper part of x and z's boundary intersects with x's boundary. This can happen if z is contained within x, and z touches x's boundary at a point. Both x and z can still touch y's boundary, satisfying the constraints. So TPPi is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is a proper part of x and z's boundary does not intersect with x's boundary. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, how can it touch y's boundary? It would need to "reach through" x to touch y's boundary, which isn't possible. So NTPPi is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x, z): This means x and z are equal, i.e., they occupy the same space. If x and z are equal, and x is a tangential proper part of y, then z is also a tangential proper part of y. This is consistent with the constraints, so EQ is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

OK, so my final answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ. That is, disconnected, externally connected, partially overlapping, x is a tangential proper part of z, z is a tangential proper part of x, or x and z are equal. All of these are consistent with the constraints.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's clarify what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP, so TPP(z,y) (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

So both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. Now I'll consider each possible relationship:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected if they are in different parts of y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z can be externally connected if they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap within y.

4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z if x is inside z and touches z's boundary (which must occur at a point where z touches y's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x couldn't also touch y's boundary as required by TPP(x,y).

6. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x if z is inside x and touches x's boundary (which must occur at a point where x touches y's boundary).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, z couldn't also touch y's boundary as required by TPPi(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z can be equal, occupying the same space.
