PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step about the given information and what we can deduce about the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Let's first understand what PO(x,y) means more precisely. It means:
- x and y have some overlap (shared parts)
- x is not completely contained in y
- y is not completely contained in x

And NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y) means:
- z is properly contained in y
- z does not touch the boundary of y

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x overlaps with parts of y that don't contain z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't overlap. This is not possible because z does not touch the boundary of y, so it can't touch the boundary of any region that's not completely containing y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x overlaps with z, but neither is contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because z is properly contained in y, and x is not contained in y (due to PO(x,y)).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is also not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained in the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because z is properly contained in y, and x is not contained in y (due to PO(x,y)).

Let me double-check my reasoning:

Since z is properly contained in y (NTPP(z,y)), and x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), the relationship between x and z depends on how exactly x and y overlap:

- If x overlaps with parts of y that include z, then x and z might partially overlap (PO(x,z)).
- If x completely contains z, then either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) could hold.
- If x doesn't overlap with the part of y that contains z, then x and z would be disconnected (DC(x,z)).

Wait, I need to reconsider TPPi(x,z). TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z touches the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (because NTPP(z,y)), and x is not completely contained in y, it's not clear if z can touch the boundary of x. Let me think about this more carefully.

If z is properly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x partially overlaps with y, then the part of x that's outside of y can't overlap with z. If z is completely contained within the overlap of x and y, then z would be properly inside x, which means NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think TPPi(x,z) is still possible. Imagine z as a small circle properly inside a larger circle y, and x as a circle that overlaps with y such that it completely contains z and the boundary of x passes through y. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me go through a more rigorous check here to make sure I haven't missed anything or made a mistake.

First, I'll recall that we have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is completely contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - Since z is completely inside y, and x overlaps with y, x could overlap with parts of y that don't include z, making DC(x,z) possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't overlap.
   - Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (NTPP(z,y)), and x is not completely containing y, the only way for x and z to touch at the boundary would be if part of x goes inside y and touches z. But this would mean that x and z overlap, which contradicts EC. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - If x overlaps with parts of y that include parts of z but not all of z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - This would mean that x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. But since z is properly inside y, and x partially overlaps with y (and is not contained in y), x cannot be completely contained in z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - For similar reasons as TPP, since x is not contained in y, it cannot be contained in z (which is inside y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - This would mean that z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Since z is properly inside y, and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to completely contain z in such a way that z touches the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - This would mean that z is completely contained in the interior of x. Since z is properly inside y, and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to completely contain z in its interior. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   - Since z is properly contained in y, and x is not contained in y (due to PO(x,y)), x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this detailed analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I still need to double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z touches the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (because NTPP(z,y)), the only way z can touch the boundary of x is if the boundary of x passes through the interior of y. This is possible if x extends into y such that its boundary passes through z. So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmmm let me just check EC more carefully because I feel like my logic may have been flawed. EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Since z is properly inside y (NTPP(z,y)), z doesn't touch the boundary of y. Now, if x and z were to touch at a boundary, it would have to be inside y. But if the boundary of x touches z inside y, then either x would have to overlap with z (which would make it PO, not EC) or z would have to touch the boundary of y (which contradicts NTPP(z,y)). So, EC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

I think my final answer is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I want to carefully re-check my logic about TPPi(x,z) again because I am having some doubts about it. TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Since z is properly inside y (NTPP(z,y)), z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

For z to touch the boundary of x, and for x to partially overlap with y, x would need to have a boundary that passes through the interior of y and through z. This is geometrically possible. Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle properly inside y, and x as a shape that partially overlaps with y such that the boundary of x passes through z. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, satisfying TPPi(x,z).

I believe my reasoning is sound, and TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z based on the given information:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if x overlaps with parts of y that don't include z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since z is completely in the interior of y, and x only partially overlaps with y, there's no way for x and z to share only a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x overlaps with part (but not all) of z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. Since z is properly inside y, and x is not contained in y (due to PO(x,y)), x cannot be contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z is completely contained in the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is properly contained in y, while x is not.
