PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's understand the given relations:

1. TPPi(x,y) means the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, we need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y) or equivalently TPP(y,x))
- y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z))

Visually, we can think of y as being inside both x and z, touching both of their boundaries. The question is: how can x and z be positioned relative to each other?

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. x and z can be disconnected (DC): This isn't possible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least y. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. x and z can be externally connected (EC): This isn't possible either. If y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, then x and z share at least y. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. x and z can partially overlap (PO): This is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, then x and z share y, but neither is necessarily a part of the other. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. x can be a tangential proper part of z (TPP): This is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x could also be a tangential proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP): This isn't straightforward. Let's analyze: If y is tangential in both x and z, and if x is totally contained within z, then x would touch the boundary of z (since y touches both x's and z's boundaries). This means x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me reconsider NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) is possible. It depends on how y touches the boundaries of x and z. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that isn't part of the boundary of z, then x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. z can be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi): This is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, and z is a tangential proper part of x, then by definition, y is a tangential proper part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. z can be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi): I think this is not possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z, then y touches the boundary of z. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x. But this would mean y is a tangential proper part of x, which contradicts our initial assumption. 

Wait, that doesn't quite add up. I might be misunderstanding the implications.

Let's consider: We know TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). This means y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a tangential proper part of z. In the case of NTPPi(x,z), z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z doesn't touch the boundary of x. 

Now, can y be a tangential proper part of x while z is a non-tangential proper part of x? If y touches the boundary of x and y is part of z, doesn't that mean z also touches the boundary of x? 

Not necessarily. If y touches the boundary of x at a point and z has y as a proper part, but z extends beyond y in all directions except toward the boundary of x, then z could still be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I think NTPPi(x,z) is not possible for a different reason. If TPP(y,z), it means y touches the boundary of z. If NTPPi(x,z), it means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Now, if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then y must be inside x and not touching the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which says y is a tangential proper part of x (meaning y touches the boundary of x). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think my reasoning was flawed. I'm overcomplicating things. Let's think about it again.

- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is entirely within x, and y touches the boundary of x at at least one point.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is entirely within z, and y touches the boundary of z at at least one point.

Now, let's consider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This isn't possible because both contain y, so they must share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This isn't possible because both contain y, so they share more than just a boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. 

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z. Is this possible? 

If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then it's possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z. For instance, if y touches the boundary of x at a point, and that point on the boundary of x also happens to be on the boundary of z, then x would touch the boundary of z, making TPP(x,z) possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Is this possible?

If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, can x be completely inside z without touching its boundary? I think not. If y touches the boundary of x at a point, and y also touches the boundary of z at some point, and y is entirely within both x and z, then it seems x must also touch the boundary of z. Thus, NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. If y touches the boundary of x at a different point than it touches the boundary of z, then x could be completely inside z without touching its boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) could be possible.

Actually, scratch that. If y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, then y touches the boundary of both x and z. But this doesn't mean that x touches the boundary of z or vice versa. For example, y could touch the boundary of x at one point and the boundary of z at a completely different point. So, NTPP(x,z) could be possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x. Is this possible?

If y is a tangential proper part of z, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x. For instance, if y touches the boundary of z at a point, and that point on the boundary of z also happens to be on the boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x, making TPPi(x,z) possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Is this possible?

If y is a tangential proper part of z, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then y touches the boundary of both x and z. If y touches the boundary of z at a point, and that point is also the boundary of x, then z would touch the boundary of x, ruling out NTPPi(x,z). But if y touches the boundary of z at a point that isn't on the boundary of x, then z could be completely inside x without touching its boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) could be possible.

Wait, let me reconsider. If TPPi(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. But if z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x (NTPPi(x,z)), then y can't touch both the boundary of z and the boundary of x. Because if y touches the boundary of z, and z is entirely inside x, then y can't reach the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This means x and z are the same region. Is this possible?

If y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x and z are the same region, then y would be a tangential proper part of the same region twice, which is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) could be possible.

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x, meaning y is strictly smaller than x. Similarly, if TPP(y,z), then y is strictly smaller than z. But if EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same size. This would mean y is strictly smaller than both x and z, which is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, I think I made an error in my analysis of NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me re-examine these:

For NTPP(x,z):
If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. If NTPP(x,z), then x is entirely within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means every part of x, including its boundary, is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. But if y touches the boundary of x, and all of x (including its boundary) is inside z, then y can't touch the boundary of z. This contradicts TPP(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y touches the boundary of z. If NTPPi(x,z), then z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means every part of z, including its boundary, is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. But if y touches the boundary of z, and all of z (including its boundary) is inside x, then y can't touch the boundary of x. This contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me draw these out to better understand:

For NTPP(x,z):
```
   z
  +-----+
  |     |
  |  x  |
  | +---+ |
  | |   | |
  | | y | |
  | +---+ |
  +-------+
```

In this diagram, if y touches the boundary of x, and x is entirely inside z without touching the boundary of z, then y can't touch the boundary of z. But TPP(y,z) requires y to touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

Actually, I'm not sure if I'm drawing this correctly. Let me try to simplify:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, TPP(y,x).
TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z.

Let me think about each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This can't be true because both contain y, so they must share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This can't be true because both contain y, so they share more than just a boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This seems possible, where x and z share a region (at least y), but neither is contained within the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z. Given that y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, it seems plausible that x could be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. If y touches the boundary of x and the boundary of z, and y is entirely within both, it seems x must also touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Actually, let's be more careful. Suppose y touches the boundary of x at point p_x and touches the boundary of z at point p_z. If these two points are the same, then x and z share a boundary point. But if p_x is different from p_z, then it's possible for x to be entirely within z without touching its boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) could be possible.

But wait, if y touches the boundary of x at a point, and y is inside z, then part of the boundary of x is inside z. If all of the boundary of x is inside z (i.e., not touching the boundary of z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which is NTPP(x,z). So, NTPP(x,z) seems possible, depending on how y touches the boundaries of x and z.

Actually, let me really focus on this. If TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z), can NTPP(x,z) be true?

If TPP(y,x), then y touches the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. If NTPP(x,z), then x doesn't touch the boundary of z. But if y touches the boundary of z and y is inside x, then some part of x is touching the boundary of z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, NTPP(x,z) isn't consistent with the given constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x. If y is a tangential proper part of z, and y is also a tangential proper part of x, then it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. If TPPi(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x. If z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then how can y touch both the boundary of z and the boundary of x? It doesn't seem possible.

Actually, I think I understand the issue now. If y touches the boundary of z, and z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x, then y can't touch the boundary of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) isn't consistent with the given constraints.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This means x and z are the same region. If y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x and z are the same region, then y is a tangential proper part of the same region, which is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, after careful analysis, it seems the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Actually, wait, let me double-check some of the reasoning again:

NTPP(x,z): We determined this isn't possible because if y touches the boundary of z and is inside x, then x must touch the boundary of z, contradicting NTPP(x,z).

NTPPi(x,z): We determined this isn't possible because if y touches the boundary of x and is inside z, and z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x, then y can't touch the boundary of x, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

I think I'm still not satisfied with my reasoning for NTPP(x,z) because I'm not visualizing it properly.

Actually, I think I was overthinking NTPP(x,z). Let's go back to the basics. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y touches the boundary of z. If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Since y is part of x, if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y can't touch the boundary of z. But this contradicts TPP(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly for NTPPi(x,z): If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. If NTPPi(x,z), then z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then no part of z, including y, can touch the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

But wait, actually I need to double-check about PO(x,z). If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can x and z partially overlap?

Let's think about the definition of PO(x,z). It means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. 

Given TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is part of x. Given TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is part of z. If both x and z contain y, then they share a spatial part. But the question is: can x and z be arranged so that neither is part of the other? It seems possible. For example:
```
    x       z
+------+   +------+
|      |   |      |
|  +---+---+---+  |
|  |   |   |   |  |
|  | y |   |   |  |
|  +---+---+---+  |
|      |   |      |
+------+   +------+
```

In this diagram, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, but neither x nor z is a part of the other. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Actually let's think more carefully about the EQ(x,z) case, because I'm not fully convinced. Let's check: If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. Given TPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x. Given TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. If x and z are the same region, then y is a proper part of this region, which is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

OK actually I'm still bothered by the NTPP(x,z) case. Let me think about it more.

Let's define a more concrete example. Imagine y is a small circle, x is a larger circle, and z is an even larger circle. Then the tangent part requirement means that y and x touch at a boundary point, and y and z touch at a boundary point. We know that y is inside both x and z, and y touches the boundary of both x and z. But this doesn't prevent x from being completely contained within z without touching the boundary of z.

For instance, y could touch the boundary of x at one point and the boundary of z at a completely different point. If x is far enough inside z, it can be a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, I believe NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Actually, I realized there's a flaw in my reasoning. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y touches the boundary of z. If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Since y is part of x, if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y can't touch the boundary of z (since y is inside x). But this contradicts TPP(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

The key point is that if y is inside x, and x is strictly inside z, then y can't touch the boundary of z.

Actually, this isn't quite right either. The assumption isn't that y is inside x; it's that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y can touch the boundary of x.

Maybe this is where the confusion arises. Let me make sure I'm understanding the definition of TPP correctly:

TPP(y,x) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is contained within x and y ≠ x).
2. y touches the boundary of x.

The condition that y touches the boundary of x doesn't mean y is at the boundary of x, but rather that y has a point that touches the boundary of x.

With this understanding, if TPPi(x,y) (which is equivalent to TPP(y,x)), then y is a tangential proper part of x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. Now, for NTPP(x,z), x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, if y touches the boundary of x and y is inside z, it means that the point where y touches the boundary of x is also inside z. This doesn't contradict the fact that x doesn't touch the boundary of z. However, if y also touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, then there's a point of y that's on the boundary of z. But this contradicts the fact that x is entirely inside z without touching its boundary.

So, the issue is: if y touches the boundary of z and y is inside x, then x must also touch the boundary of z, contradicting NTPP(x,z).

It's clear to me now: NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z): If TPPi(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. If NTPPi(x,z), then z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Since y is inside z, if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y can't touch the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Actually, it just dawned on me: TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is wholly inside x, and y touches the boundary of x. But this only implies that part of the boundary of y touches the boundary of x. The rest of y, including most of its interior, can be far from the boundary of x.

Similarly, TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is wholly inside z, and part of the boundary of y touches the boundary of z.

With this understanding, let's check if NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

If NTPP(x,z), then x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Now, if y is a tangential proper part of x, y is inside x. If y also touches the boundary of z, then x must be close enough to the boundary of z such that y, which is inside x, can touch the boundary of z.

But if y is inside x and x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y can't touch the boundary of z, contradicting TPP(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Actually, I made an error. Let's clarify the definitions again:

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

When I say "y touches the boundary of x," it means there's at least one point of y that is also on the boundary of x. It doesn't mean the entire boundary of y touches the boundary of x.

Now, if TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can NTPP(x,z) be true?

If NTPP(x,z), then x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Given TPP(y,z), y touches the boundary of z. But if y is inside x, and x is entirely inside z without touching the boundary of z, then y can't touch the boundary of z. This contradicts TPP(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Actually, that's not correct either. We're assuming that if y is a tangential proper part of x, then y is "inside" x. But the definition of TPP states that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. Being a proper part means y is contained within x, not that y is "inside" in the sense of being in the interior of x.

Let me try to be more precise. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. In other words, y is contained within x, and there's at least one point of y that is also on the boundary of x.

Similarly, if TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is contained within z, and there's at least one point of y that is also on the boundary of z.

Now, for NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would be entirely inside z without touching the boundary of z. If y is contained within x, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y can't touch the boundary of z, which contradicts TPP(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Actually, I'm getting confused by the "inside" vs. "contained within" distinction. Let's use the formal definition: if TPP(a,b), then a is a proper part of b and a shares at least one point with the boundary of b.

Now, if TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can NTPP(x,z) be true?

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and y shares at least one point with the boundary of z. If NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x doesn't share any points with the boundary of z.

Given that y is a proper part of x, if x doesn't share any points with the boundary of z, then y, being contained within x, can't share any points with the boundary of z either. But this contradicts TPP(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

I'm still struggling with visualizing this. Let me approach it from a slightly different angle. Instead of thinking about the entire regions x, y, and z, let's focus on the boundaries and the relationships between them.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x. Let's call this shared point p_x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and y shares at least one point with the boundary of z. Let's call this shared point p_z.

Now, if NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x doesn't share any points with the boundary of z. This means every point of x, including its boundary, is inside z and away from the boundary of z.

But we know y is a proper part of x, so y is inside x. And y shares a point p_z with the boundary of z. But if y is inside x, and x is entirely inside z and away from the boundary of z, then y can't reach the boundary of z to share a point with it.

So, NTPP(x,z) leads to a contradiction with the given conditions. Hence, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z): If z is entirely inside x and away from the boundary of x, then y, being inside z, can't reach the boundary of x to share a point with it. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Let's double-check all these possible relationships to make sure they're all consistent with the given constraints.

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means x and z share a region, but neither is contained within the other. Given TPPi(x,y), y is contained within x. Given TPP(y,z), y is contained within z. So, y is in the shared region of x and z. This is consistent with PO(x,z).

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained within z and shares at least one point with the boundary of z. Given TPPi(x,y), y is contained within x. Given TPP(y,z), y is contained within z. So, y is contained within both x and z, which is consistent with TPP(x,z). Additionally, since y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, it's plausible that x also touches the boundary of z, which aligns with TPP(x,z).

3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained within x and shares at least one point with the boundary of x. Given TPPi(x,y), y is contained within x. Given TPP(y,z), y is contained within z. So, y is contained within both x and z, which is consistent with TPPi(x,z). Additionally, since y touches the boundary of x, and y is contained within z, it's plausible that z also touches the boundary of x, which aligns with TPPi(x,z).

4. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This means x and z are the same region. Given TPPi(x,y), y is contained within x. Given TPP(y,z), y is contained within z. So, y is contained within both x and z, which is consistent with EQ(x,z).

All four relationships seem consistent with the given constraints.

Actually one last concern I have: are we sure about TPP(x,z)?

Let's reason about it: If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and y shares at least one point with the boundary of z. If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x shares at least one point with the boundary of z.

Now, if y is contained within x, and x is contained within z, then y is also contained within z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). Given that y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, it's possible that the part of y that touches the boundary of z is also a part of the boundary of x, which would make x touch the boundary of z. This would be consistent with TPP(x,z).

Actually, here's a simple way to visualize it. Imagine a circle y inside a larger circle x, where y touches the boundary of x at a point. Now, imagine x inside an even larger circle z, where x touches the boundary of z at a point. If the point where y touches the boundary of x is the same point where x touches the boundary of z, then y also touches the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

And a similar argument can be made for TPPi(x,z).

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), I need to analyze the constraints these relations impose.

First, let me clarify what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z

This means:
- y is contained within both x and z
- y touches the boundary of both x and z

Now I'll evaluate each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Impossible because both x and z contain y, so they must share at least this region.

2. EC(x,z) - Impossible because they share y, which is more than just boundary contact.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y in their shared region.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be contained within z while touching its boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Impossible. If x were completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (which is part of x) couldn't touch z's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. z can be contained within x while touching its boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Impossible. If z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (which is part of z) couldn't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - Possible. x and z can be the same region, with y as a tangential proper part of both.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
