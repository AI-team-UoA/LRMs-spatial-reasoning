PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap (they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other)
- TPPi(y,z) - y is a tangential proper part of z inverted, which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's visualize this:
- y partially overlaps with x (PO(x,y))
- z is a part of y and touches y's boundary (TPP(z,y))

Since z is properly contained within y (touching y's boundary), and y partially overlaps with x, there are several possible configurations for how x and z relate:

1. x and z might be disconnected (DC) - if the overlap between x and y doesn't include any part of z
2. x and z might be externally connected (EC) - if x touches z at the boundary but doesn't overlap with it
3. x and z might partially overlap (PO) - if x overlaps with the part of y that contains z
4. z might be a tangential proper part of x (TPP) - if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary
5. z might be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP) - if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary

Let me think more carefully about each possibility:

DC(x,z) - Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if the portion of y that overlaps with x doesn't include any part of z.

EC(x,z) - Can x and z externally connect (touch at boundary)? Yes, if the boundary of the overlap between x and y touches z.

PO(x,z) - Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of z is in the overlap between x and y, but not all of z.

TPP(z,x) - Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely contained in the overlap between x and y, and z touches the boundary of that overlap which is also the boundary of x.

NTPP(z,x) - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely contained in the overlap between x and y, and z does not touch any boundary of x.

TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z? I don't think so. Since z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, x cannot be fully contained in z.

NTPP(x,z) - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

EQ(x,z) - Can x and z be equal? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, so they cannot be equal.

Let me verify my reasoning once more:

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y

DC(x,z): Possible. x overlaps with y, but that overlap might not include any part of z.
EC(x,z): Possible. The boundary of x's overlap with y might touch z.
PO(x,z): Possible. Part of z might be in the overlap between x and y.
TPP(z,x): Possible. z might be completely within the overlap between x and y, touching the boundary.
NTPP(z,x): Possible. z might be completely within the overlap between x and y, not touching the boundary.

For the inverted relations:
TPP(x,z): Not possible. x extends outside of y in some parts (due to PO(x,y)), and z is contained within y, so x cannot be contained within z.
NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP(x,z).
EQ(x,z): Not possible. x cannot be equal to z because x extends outside of y in some areas, while z is contained within y.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x) which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x) which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, let me reconsider this more carefully. I think I made some errors in my reasoning.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y inverted, which means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Let me correct my visualization:
- y partially overlaps with x (PO(x,y))
- y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z))

Now, with this corrected understanding, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Can x be disconnected from z? No, because y overlaps with x, and y is contained in z, so there must be some overlap between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): Can x externally connect with z? Yes, if the part of x that overlaps with y only touches the boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z): Can x partially overlap with z? Yes, if part of x is in z (through the overlap with y) and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? No, because z contains y, and y partially overlaps with x, so z cannot be contained within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? No, for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? No, because y is a proper part of z but partially overlaps with x, so x and z cannot be equal.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Wait, let me think more carefully about whether DC(x,z) is possible.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is contained in z and touches z's boundary

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be completely separate with no shared points. However, since y overlaps with x (they share interior points), and y is inside z, there must be some part of x that is also inside z (the part that overlaps with y). Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Now I'm satisfied with my analysis. The possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check this once more.

1. We know PO(x,y), which means x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
2. We know TPPi(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to touch only at their boundaries, with no shared interior points. However, since y shares interior points with x (due to PO(x,y)), and y is inside z, it means that x and z must share some interior points (the ones that x shares with y). Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So I need to revise again. The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me think about this one more time:

1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

EC(x,z): Can x and z touch only at their boundaries? If x only overlaps with the part of y that touches z's boundary, then the only connection between x and z would be at the boundary. But wait, if x and y overlap, they share interior points, and if y is inside z, then those shared interior points are also inside z. So x and z must share interior points, which means EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of x is in z (through the overlap with y) and part of x is outside z.

TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So the possible relations are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let's have one more moment of clarity:

1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

We know that y is completely inside z. We also know that x overlaps with y, but neither is fully contained in the other.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be completely separate with no shared points. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, at least the part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to touch only at their boundaries. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, the part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z, meaning x and z share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to overlap, but neither would be contained in the other. Since y is inside z, and x overlaps with y, part of x is inside z. If part of x is also outside of z, then PO(x,z) holds true.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. This is possible if all of x is inside z and some part of x touches the boundary of z.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if all of x is inside z and no part of x touches the boundary of z.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since y is inside z, and y is not completely inside x (due to PO(x,y)), z cannot be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. For the same reason as TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be identical. But since y is inside z, and y is not identical to x (due to PO(x,y)), x and z cannot be identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I've checked multiple times, and I'm confident in this answer now.

Actually, let me think again about whether EC(x,z) is possible.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to share no interior points, only boundary points. However, since x shares interior points with y (due to PO(x,y)), and y is inside z, then x must share interior points with z as well. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me see if I can convince myself with a concrete example. Imagine:
- y is a square inside z, touching z's boundary
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with square y

The part of the circle x that overlaps with square y is necessarily inside z (since y is inside z). That means x and z share interior points, not just boundary points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, I confirm that the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I should be more careful about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, if all of x is inside z and x touches the boundary of z. Since y touches the boundary of z (due to TPPi(y,z)), and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to also touch the boundary of z through its overlap with y.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, if all of x is inside z and no part of x touches the boundary of z. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y does not include the part of y that touches z's boundary.

So, the possible relations between x and z are indeed:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Final check: DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are all not possible for the reasons I've explained.

Wait, let me explicitly check DC again:

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be completely separate with no shared points. But since x overlaps with y (they share interior points), and y is inside z, it follows that x shares points with z (specifically, the points that x shares with y). Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Now let me explicitly check EC again:

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to touch only at their boundaries, with no shared interior points. But since x and y share interior points (due to PO(x,y)), and y is inside z, it follows that x and z share interior points (specifically, the interior points that x shares with y). Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

I've now thoroughly checked all possibilities, and I'm confident that the only possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me be even more thorough by examining all 8 RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Not possible because x shares interior points with y (due to PO(x,y)), and y is inside z (due to TPPi(y,z)), so x must share points with z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (they touch but don't overlap). Not possible because x shares interior points with y, and y is inside z, so x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Possible if part of x is inside z (through its overlap with y) and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). Possible if all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). Possible if all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). Not possible because z contains y (due to TPPi(y,z)), and y is not completely inside x (due to PO(x,y)), so z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). Not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. Not possible because z contains y (due to TPPi(y,z)), and y is not equal to x (due to PO(x,y)), so x and z cannot be equal.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm very confident in this answer now.

Actually, let me consider one more thing. I need to be careful about the direction of TPPi(y,z).

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z inverted, which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, with this interpretation, my previous analysis is not correct. Let me re-analyze the problem.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained within y and touches y's boundary)

Now, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if z is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, if z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of z is in the overlap between x and y, but not all of z.

4. TPP(z,x): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and touches the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

5. NTPP(z,x): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

6. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x is not contained within y (due to PO(x,y)), so x cannot be contained within z.

7. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y but is not equal to y, so x and z cannot be equal.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z) [which is TPP(z,x)]
- NTPPi(x,z) [which is NTPP(z,x)]

But wait, let me double check the definition of TPPi again to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y inverted, which is the inverse of TPP(z,y). In other words, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Ok, I think my first analysis was correct. Let me go back to that.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained within z and touches z's boundary)

Now, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? No, because x overlaps with y, and y is contained in z, so x must overlap with z to some extent.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected? No, because x overlaps with y, and y is contained in z, so x must share interior points with z, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of x is in z (through its overlap with y) and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? No, because z contains y, and y is not completely contained in x (due to PO(x,y)), so z cannot be contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? No, for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? No, because z contains y, and y is not equal to x (due to PO(x,y)), so x and z cannot be equal.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm confident in this answer.

But wait, let me really make sure I'm correct about TPPi, by examining what each letter stands for:
- TPP = Tangential Proper Part
- i = inverse

So, TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, which is TPP(z,y). In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Hmm, that contradicts what I just said. Let me carefully think about the notation again.

In the RCC-8 calculus, TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b. The inverse relation, TPPi(a,b), means that b is a tangential proper part of a, which is the same as TPP(b,a).

So, TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, which is the same as TPP(z,y). In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, with this understanding, let me re-analyze the problem.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained within y and touches y's boundary)

Now, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if z is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, if z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of z is in the overlap between x and y, but not all of z.

4. TPP(z,x): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and touches the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

5. NTPP(z,x): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

6. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x is not contained within y (due to PO(x,y)), so x cannot be contained within z.

7. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y but is not equal to y, so x and z cannot be equal.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x) [which is the same as TPPi(x,z)]
- NTPP(z,x) [which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)]

Let me simplify and say the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, no. Let me be very explicit. 

TPP(a,b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b.
TPPi(a,b) means the inverse, which is TPP(b,a), meaning b is a tangential proper part of a.

So, TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, which is the same as TPP(z,y).

Now, if TPP(z,x) is true, that means z is a tangential proper part of x. The inverse of this would be TPPi(z,x), which is the same as TPP(x,z), meaning x is a tangential proper part of z.

But in my analysis, I determined that TPP(z,x) is a possible relation between x and z, but TPP(x,z) is not possible. Therefore, the correct way to express this in the answer is TPP(z,x), not TPPi(x,z).

Similarly, if NTPP(z,x) is true, that means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The inverse of this would be NTPPi(z,x), which is the same as NTPP(x,z), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

But in my analysis, I determined that NTPP(z,x) is a possible relation between x and z, but NTPP(x,z) is not possible. Therefore, the correct way to express this in the answer is NTPP(z,x), not NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Actually, let me re-read the question. It asks for the possible relationships between x and z, not z and x. In the RCC-8 calculus, the relations are written in the form R(a,b), where the relation R holds between a and b in that order.

So, I need to express the relations in the form R(x,z).

If TPP(z,x) is true, that means z is a tangential proper part of x. The equivalent relation from x's perspective would be TPPi(x,z), which means x is such that z is a tangential proper part of it.

Similarly, if NTPP(z,x) is true, that means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The equivalent relation from x's perspective would be NTPPi(x,z), which means x is such that z is a non-tangential proper part of it.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z, expressed in the form R(x,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself unnecessarily. Let me just stick to the definition of the relations.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained within y and touches y's boundary)

With this setup, let me consider all possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if z is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, if z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of z is in the overlap between x and y, but not all of z.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x is not contained within y (due to PO(x,y)), so x cannot be contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and touches the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y but is not equal to y, so x and z cannot be equal.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, actually now I'm not sure about the TPPi case. Let's check:

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? If z is in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z touches the boundary of that overlap which is also the boundary of x, then z could be a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? If z is in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of that overlap, then z could be a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm now convinced of this answer. I've considered all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, and these are the ones that can hold given the constraints PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, let me reconsider some of the cases, because I think we would need for y to contain z for some of them to work.

DC(x, z): 
For x and z to be disconnected, they must share no points. Given PO(x, y), x and y share interior points. And given TPPi(y, z), z is contained within y. For x and z to be disconnected, the part of y that overlaps with x would need to be disjoint from z. This is indeed possible.

EC(x, z):
For x and z to be externally connected, they must share only boundary points, not interior points. Given PO(x, y), x and y share interior points. And given TPPi(y, z), z is contained within y. For x and z to be externally connected, the part of y that overlaps with x would need to be disjoint from the interior of z, but z's boundary would need to touch the boundary of the overlap between x and y. This is possible.

PO(x, z):
For x and z to partially overlap, they must share interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), it's possible for x and z to share interior points (if z overlaps with the part of y that overlaps with x) but for neither to contain the other. So PO(x, z) is possible.

TPP(x, z):
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary. Given TPPi(y, z), z is contained within y. And given PO(x, y), x is not contained within y. Therefore, x cannot be contained within z, and TPP(x, z) is not possible.

NTPP(x, z):
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be completely contained in z and not touch z's boundary. For the same reason as TPP(x, z), this is not possible.

TPPi(x, z):
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be completely contained in x and touch x's boundary. Given TPPi(y, z), z is contained within y. If z is also within the part of y that overlaps with x, and z touches the boundary of that overlap (which is also the boundary of x), then z can be a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x, z) is possible.

NTPPi(x, z):
For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be completely contained in x and not touch x's boundary. If z is within the part of y that overlaps with x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of that overlap, then z can be a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPPi(x, z) is possible.

EQ(x, z):
For x and z to be equal, they must have the same extent. Given TPPi(y, z), z is a proper part of y. And given PO(x, y), x is not equal to y. Therefore, x cannot be equal to z, and EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

I'm now confident in this answer, having carefully examined all 8 RCC-8 relations and determined which ones can hold given the constraints PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z).

Actually, on further reflection, I think I made an error in my interpretation of the problem. Let me carefully reconsider the meaning of TPPi(y, z).

TPPi(y, z) means the inverse of TPP(y, z), which would be TPP(z, y). In other words, z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let me re-analyze the problem:

Given:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y, z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained within y and touches y's boundary)

With this understanding, I can now correctly analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if z is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x, z): Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, if z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y.

3. PO(x, z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of z is in the overlap between x and y, but not all of z.

4. TPP(x, z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x is not contained within y (due to PO(x, y)), so x cannot be contained within z.

5. NTPP(x, z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, for the same reason as TPP(x, z).

6. TPPi(x, z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and touches the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x, z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x, z): Can x and z be equal? No, because z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y but is not equal to y, so x and z cannot be equal.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

I'm now confident in this answer, having carefully examined all 8 RCC-8 relations and determined which ones can hold given the constraints PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z).

Actually, I think I had it right all along.

One more time, to make it explicit:

TPP(a, b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b, i.e., a is contained within b and touches b's boundary.
TPPi(a, b) means the inverse of TPP(a, b), which is TPP(b, a), meaning b is a tangential proper part of a, i.e., b is contained within a and touches a's boundary.

So, TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y, z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained within y and touches y's boundary)

The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
- EC(x, z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y.
- PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of z is in the overlap between x and y, but not all of z.
- TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and touches the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x.

The relations TPP(x, z), NTPP(x, z), and EQ(x, z) are not possible given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

I'm confident in this answer, having carefully examined all 8 RCC-8 relations and determined which ones can hold given the constraints PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z).

But wait, just to be completely sure, let me check one of the "impossible" cases more carefully:

TPP(x, z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x would need to be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary. Given TPPi(y, z), z is contained within y and touches y's boundary. Given PO(x, y), x and y share interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Since z is contained within y, and x is not contained within y, it's not possible for x to be contained within z. Therefore, TPP(x, z) is indeed not possible.

I'm finally completely confident in my answer.

Actually, let me just be completely sure about TPPi(x, z) and NTPPi(x, z) as well.

TPPi(x, z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? For this to be true, z would need to be completely contained in x and touch x's boundary. Given TPPi(y, z), z is contained within y and touches y's boundary. Given PO(x, y), x and y share interior points, but neither is contained in the other. For z to be contained within x, it would need to be completely within the overlap between x and y. Furthermore, for z to touch x's boundary, it would need to touch the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x. This scenario is possible. Therefore, TPPi(x, z) is indeed possible.

NTPPi(x, z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? For this to be true, z would need to be completely contained in x and not touch x's boundary. Given TPPi(y, z), z is contained within y and touches y's boundary. Given PO(x, y), x and y share interior points, but neither is contained in the other. For z to be contained within x, it would need to be completely within the overlap between x and y. Furthermore, for z to not touch x's boundary, it would need to not touch the boundary of that overlap, which is also the boundary of x. This scenario is possible. Therefore, NTPPi(x, z) is indeed possible.

With these additional checks, I remain confident in my answer.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations could possibly hold between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if z is located in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Possible if z touches the boundary of the overlap region between x and y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if z partially overlaps with the intersection of x and y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible because z is contained within y, and x extends beyond y (due to PO(x,y)), so x cannot be contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is completely within the overlap between x and y and touches the boundary of that overlap region.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z is completely within the overlap between x and y without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is a proper part of y, while x is not (due to PO(x,y)).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
