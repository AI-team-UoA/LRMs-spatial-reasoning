PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are essentially the same spatial region. This means that any relationship that x has with y, x will also have with z.

If NTPP(x,y), then x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Since z is exactly the same as y (because EQ(y,z)), x must also be completely inside z and not touching z's boundary.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let's double-check this by considering each of the eight RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - No, because x is inside y, and y is the same as z, so x cannot be disconnected from z.
2. EC(x,z) - No, because x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is the same as z, so x cannot touch z's boundary.
3. PO(x,z) - No, because x is entirely inside y, and y is the same as z, so x is entirely inside z, not partially overlapping.
4. TPP(x,z) - No, because TPP would mean that x touches z's boundary, but we know that x doesn't touch y's boundary (it's NTPP), and y is the same as z.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Yes, because x is entirely inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is the same as z, so x is entirely inside z without touching its boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - No, because this would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, which contradicts x being inside y (and y being the same as z).
7. NTPPi(x,z) - No, because this would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which contradicts x being inside y (and y being the same as z).
8. EQ(x,z) - No, because x is a proper part of y, not equal to y, and y is the same as z, so x cannot be equal to z.

So, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what happens to the spatial relationship when we have NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (exactly the same spatial region).

Since y and z occupy the exact same space (EQ(y,z)), any relationship that x has with y must also apply to z. 

If x is completely inside y without touching its boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and y is identical to z, then x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
