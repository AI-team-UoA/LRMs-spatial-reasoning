PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi

Wait, wait, that's conflicting. Let me check again. Earlier reasoning suggested EC, PO, TPPi. But the user's answer mentions DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi. Wait, but according to the composition table, it's EC, PO, TPPi. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, no, the correct answer according to the RCC-8 composition table for TPP⁻¹ ; EC is {EC, PO, TPP⁻¹, NTPP⁻¹}. Wait, maybe I missed NTPPi. Let me check.

Wait, according to the RCC8 composition table (source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370200000272), the composition of TPP⁻¹ (x,y) and EC(y,z) gives possible relations between x and z as PO, EC, TPP⁻¹, NTPP⁻¹. So that's EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi. But how?

Wait, perhaps if z is inside x but not touching x's boundary (NTPP(z,x)), which would be NTPPi(x,z). But earlier reasoning thought that was impossible because z must touch y's boundary, which is on x's boundary, hence z would touch x's boundary, making NTPP impossible. But according to the composition table, NTPPi is possible. So where is the mistake here?

Let me think of a scenario where z is NTPP of x (NTPP(z,x) which is NTPPi(x,z)). If z is entirely inside x, not touching x's boundary, but touches y's boundary. But y is a TPP of x, touching x's boundary. So z is inside x, touches y's boundary. But since y is touching x's boundary, then z touching y's boundary would be inside x. So z is entirely inside x, touches y's boundary (which is inside x's interior?), no. Wait, if y is a TPP of x, then y touches x's boundary. So the boundary of y is part of x's boundary. Therefore, if z is EC to y, then z must touch y's boundary, which is part of x's boundary. So z must touch x's boundary. Therefore, if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, then z is a TPP of x (TPPi(x,z)). If z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary, then z is an NTPP of x, but in that case, z can't touch y's boundary because y's boundary is part of x's boundary, so z would have to touch x's boundary, contradicting NTPP. Therefore, according to this reasoning, NTPPi shouldn't be possible. But the composition table includes NTPPi. So there's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the composition table is considering cases where the regions are not restricted to being 2D. Maybe in 3D, a region z could be inside x (NTPP) and still touch y's boundary without touching x's boundary. For example, if x is a sphere, y is a smaller sphere inside x touching x's boundary (like a bump on the surface), and z is another sphere inside x, touching y's boundary but not x's. But in 3D, if y is touching x's boundary (surface), then y's boundary is part of x's surface. If z is inside x and touches y's boundary (which is on x's surface), then z must touch x's surface, making z a TPP. Therefore, even in 3D, NTPP seems impossible. So why does the composition table include NTPPi?

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check a reliable source. According to the RCC-8 composition table (e.g., from https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/191666.191725), the composition of TPP⁻¹ and EC is indeed {EC, PO, TPP⁻¹, NTPP⁻¹}. So according to the table, NTPPi is possible. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me try to construct a scenario where NTPPi(x,z) holds. That means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is entirely inside x, not touching x's boundary. But z is EC to y, which is a TPP of x (touching x's boundary). How can z touch y's boundary without touching x's boundary?

Imagine x is a 2D circle. y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary (TPP(y,x)). Now, z is a small circle entirely inside x, not touching x's boundary (so NTPP(z,x)), but z touches y's boundary. However, since y is touching x's boundary, the boundary of y is at the edge of x. If z is inside x and touches y's boundary, which is on the edge of x, then z must also touch x's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(z,x). Therefore, in 2D, this seems impossible.

But wait, maybe in higher dimensions. Suppose x is a 3D sphere. y is a smaller sphere inside x, touching x's boundary (like a bump). z is another sphere inside x, touching y but not x's boundary. In 3D, if y is a bump on x's surface, z could be inside x, touching y's "side" that faces inward, not the part that's on x's surface. So z touches y's boundary but not x's. In this case, z is NTPP of x and EC to y. This seems possible in 3D. Hence, in such a case, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Ah, so in 3D, this is possible. Since RCC-8 is applicable to regions of any dimension, the composition table includes NTPPi as a possible relation. Therefore, the answer should include EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

So the correct answer is EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

But then why didn't my initial 2D example consider this? Because in 2D, it's impossible, but RCC-8 is for general regions. Therefore, the possible relations are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, but the original problem didn't specify the dimension. So according to the composition table, the answer includes these four. So I must have missed NTPPi in my initial reasoning because I was thinking in 2D. Hence, the correct answer is EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
