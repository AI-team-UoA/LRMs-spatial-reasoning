PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is part of y and touches y’s boundary (Glimberish(x,y)), and z is also part of y and touches y’s boundary (Narpulate(y,z)), then x and z can either be disjoint, meet only at a boundary, share interior parts without one containing the other, one contain the other with boundary contact, or coincide. Concretely, all of the following are possible:  
• Blorpticate(x,z),  
• Snarfloon(x,z),  
• Twizzlump(x,z),  
• Glimberish(x,z),  
• Narpulate(x,z),  
• Frooblenap(x,z).  

The only impossible cases are the “internal‐part” relations (Crindlewop and Zindlequack), because both x and z lie on the boundary of y and cannot be strictly interior to one another.  

### Answer: Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, Narpulate, Frooblenap.
