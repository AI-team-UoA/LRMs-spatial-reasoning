PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is completely disjoint from y while y merely touches z, then there is no topological obstruction preventing x from being (i) disjoint from z, (ii) just touching z, (iii) overlapping with z, or (iv) lying entirely within z (touching or not touching z’s boundary). The only impossible cases would require z to lie in x (because then y could not touch z’s boundary from “outside” without intersecting x) or for x and z to coincide (which would force y to touch x). Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)

### Answer: Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, or Crindlewop.
