PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are disjoint (Blorpticate(x,y)) and z is part of y (Narpulate(y,z)), then z is contained entirely within y. Since x shares no boundary or interior with y, it also cannot share any boundary or interior with anything contained in y. Thus x and z must also be disjoint. 

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z).
