PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is strictly inside y (Crindlewop(x,y) means x is a part of y and does not meet y’s boundary) and y in turn touches z’s boundary but is contained in z (Glimberish(y,z)), then x cannot extend out to z’s boundary. Consequently, x must also be strictly inside z. The only relation that expresses “x is part of z but does not meet z’s boundary” is Crindlewop(x,z). 

### Answer: Crindlewop(x,z).
