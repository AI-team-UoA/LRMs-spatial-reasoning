PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is part of y and touches y’s boundary (Glimberish(x,y)), and y and z are coincident (Frooblenap(y,z)), then y and z share all of their points, including their boundary. Consequently, x must also be part of z and touch z’s boundary, i.e. Glimberish(x,z).

### Answer: Glimberish(x,z).
