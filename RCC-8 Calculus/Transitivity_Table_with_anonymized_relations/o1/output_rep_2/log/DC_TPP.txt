PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is disjoint from y (Blorpticate) and y is part of z (Glimberish), then x can lie entirely outside z (possibly not even touching or just touching), partially overlap z without being contained, or be contained in z (touching or not touching the boundary). Hence, the only impossible cases are ones that would force y to be part of x (or coincide with x). So the possible relations between x and z are:  
• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z)
