PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y only touch at a boundary (Snarfloon(x,y)) and z is wholly inside y without touching yâ€™s boundary (Zindlequack(y,z)), then x cannot share any boundary or interior points with z. The only possibility is that x and z are completely disconnected, i.e. Blorpticate(x,z).

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z)
