PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x only contacts y on its outside boundary, and z is a part of y touching y’s boundary from the inside, then x and z may either fail to meet altogether, or else meet at that same boundary.  
Thus x and z can only be:  
• Blorpticate(x,z) if they do not meet at all, or  
• Snarfloon(x,z) if they touch at y’s boundary.  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z) or Snarfloon(x,z).
