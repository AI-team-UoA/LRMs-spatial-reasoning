PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (Zindlequack(x,y)) but y only partially overlaps z (Twizzlump(y,z)), then z can either lie wholly inside x (possibly touching its boundary or not) or else extend beyond x in a partial overlap. Concretely, that means x and z can be:  
• Twizzlump(x,z) (partially overlapping),  
• Narpulate(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x), or  
• Zindlequack(x,z) (z is a non‐tangential proper part of x).

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
