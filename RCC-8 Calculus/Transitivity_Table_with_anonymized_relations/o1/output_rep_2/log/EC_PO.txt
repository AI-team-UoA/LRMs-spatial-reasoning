PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Snarfloon(x,y) tells us only that x and y share a boundary (no interior points in common), and Twizzlump(y,z) tells us that y and z do share interior points (but neither is contained in the other).  From these alone, there is nothing forcing x and z either to overlap, to be disjoint, or to be in a partâ€“whole relation.  The only impossibility is for x and z to coincide (Frooblenap), because if x = z then x would also share interior points with y (contradicting Snarfloon(x,y)).  All other relations remain consistent with these constraints.

### Answer:
Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).  Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.
