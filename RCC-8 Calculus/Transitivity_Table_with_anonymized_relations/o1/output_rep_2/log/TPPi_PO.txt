PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Narpulate(x,y) then y is part of x (touching x’s boundary). Since Twizzlump(y,z) means y and z share an interior part without either’s being contained in the other, it follows that x and z must at least share some interior points (through y). Hence x and z cannot be disjoint (Blorpticate) or mere boundary‐touching (Snarfloon), nor can x be contained in z (Glimberish, Crindlewop) or coincide with z (Frooblenap). The remaining possibilities are:  
• Twizzlump(x,z) – x and z partially overlap (z extends beyond x),  
• Narpulate(x,z) – z is part of x with boundary contact,  
• Zindlequack(x,z) – z is part of x without boundary contact.  

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
