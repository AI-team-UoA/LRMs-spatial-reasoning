PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the standpoint of the standard RCC‐like definitions given:

• Zindlequack(x,y) says y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (y ⊂ x, no boundary contact with x).  
• Snarfloon(y,z) says y and z are externally connected (they share a boundary but have no interior overlap).

Since y is wholly inside x (and does not even touch x’s boundary), any boundary contact between y and z must occur strictly in the interior of x.  That guarantees x and z are not disjoint and forces at least one common point (the point where y and z touch).  One then checks each RCC‐type relation between x and z to see which remain possible:

• Blorpticate(x,z) (disconnected) is impossible, because x and z do share at least that boundary point of y.  
• Frooblenap(x,z) (coincident) would force y to be a part of z as well, contradicting Snarfloon(y,z).  
• Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z) (x ⊂ z) likewise force y ⊂ x ⊂ z, giving y interior overlap with z and contradicting Snarfloon(y,z).  

Hence, the remaining possibilities are:  
1) Snarfloon(x,z) (external connection),  
2) Twizzlump(x,z) (proper overlap of interiors),  
3) Narpulate(x,z) (z a tangential proper part of x),  
4) Zindlequack(x,z) (z a non‐tangential proper part of x).

Thus the possible relationships between x and z are: Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Narpulate, or Zindlequack.

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
