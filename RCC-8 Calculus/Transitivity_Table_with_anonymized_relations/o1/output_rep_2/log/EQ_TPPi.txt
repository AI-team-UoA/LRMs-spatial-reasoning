PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Because Frooblenap(x,y) means x and y coincide, we have x and y occupying exactly the same region. Then Narpulate(y,z) is “z is part of y and touches y’s boundary.” Substituting y with x shows that z is part of x and touches x’s boundary. By definition, that is exactly Narpulate(x,z). No other relation fits those conditions. 

### Answer: Narpulate(x,z).
