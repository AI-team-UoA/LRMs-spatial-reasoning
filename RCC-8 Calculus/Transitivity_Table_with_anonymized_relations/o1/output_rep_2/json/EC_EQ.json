{"prompt": "If Snarfloon(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Snarfloon(x,y) means x and y share only a boundary (no interior), and Frooblenap(y,z) means y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same region). If y and z are the same region, then x shares only a boundary with y exactly if x shares only a boundary with z. Hence the only possible relationship between x and z is Snarfloon(x,z).\n\n### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 15.662347555160522, "reasoning-tokens": 1792, "completion-tokens": 1925}
