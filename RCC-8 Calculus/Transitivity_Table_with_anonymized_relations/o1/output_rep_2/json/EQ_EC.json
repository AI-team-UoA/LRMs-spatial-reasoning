{"prompt": "If Frooblenap(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y are coincident (Frooblenap(x,y)), then x and y occupy exactly the same region. So, given Snarfloon(y,z) (y and z share only a boundary and no interior), x and z must likewise share that very same boundary (and no interior), because x = y. Thus, the only consistent possibility is Snarfloon(x,z).\n\n### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 14.400442600250244, "reasoning-tokens": 1664, "completion-tokens": 1794}
