{"prompt": "If Snarfloon(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y only touch at a boundary (Snarfloon(x,y)) and z is wholly inside y without touching y\u2019s boundary (Zindlequack(y,z)), then x cannot share any boundary or interior points with z. The only possibility is that x and z are completely disconnected, i.e. Blorpticate(x,z).\n\n### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 25.075955867767334, "reasoning-tokens": 2176, "completion-tokens": 2305}
