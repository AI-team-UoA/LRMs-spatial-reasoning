{"prompt": "If Twizzlump(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If y and z are coincident, then any spatial sharing or non\u2010sharing that holds between x and y will hold in exactly the same way between x and z. Since x and y share an interior part but neither is part of the other (Twizzlump), it follows that x and z share that same interior region but neither is part of the other. \n\n### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 18.601147890090942, "reasoning-tokens": 1984, "completion-tokens": 2104}
