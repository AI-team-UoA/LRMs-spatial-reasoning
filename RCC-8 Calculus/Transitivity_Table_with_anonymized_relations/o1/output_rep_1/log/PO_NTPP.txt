PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Twizzlump(x,y) tells us that x and y share an interior part but neither is contained in the other. Crindlewop(y,z) tells us that y is wholly contained in z (and does not touch z’s boundary). From these, x and y overlap somewhere inside z, so x must also share an interior part with z. This rules out both Blorpticate(x,z) and Snarfloon(x,z), since those require no interior overlap.

If x extends outside z, then x is not contained in z, and so x and z would Twizzlump. If x is entirely inside z (which is still possible while not being contained in y, since z is bigger than y), then x is part of z. In that case, x may or may not touch z’s boundary, giving Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z). Other relations (e.g. Narpulate, Zindlequack, Frooblenap) would imply y is part of x or x and z coincide, which contradicts Twizzlump(x,y). Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:

• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).
