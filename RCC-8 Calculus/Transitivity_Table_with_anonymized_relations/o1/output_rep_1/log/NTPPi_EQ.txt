PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Because Zindlequack(x,y) is the same as Crindlewop(y,x), it follows that y is wholly in the interior of x (with no boundary contact). Frooblenap(y,z) means y and z coincide, so z occupies exactly the same region as y. Hence z is also wholly in the interior of x (with no boundary contact). That configuration corresponds uniquely to Zindlequack(x,z). 

### Answer: Zindlequack(x,z).
