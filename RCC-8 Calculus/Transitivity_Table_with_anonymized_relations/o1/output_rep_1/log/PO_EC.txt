PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x Twizzlump y (they overlap in interior but neither contains the other) and y Snarfloon z (they only share boundary, with no interior overlap), then x and z can be related in any of the following ways but no others:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  

(They cannot be Glimberish, Crindlewop, or Frooblenap, because each of those would force y and z to share interior, contradicting Snarfloon(y,z).)

### Answer: Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Narpulate, Zindlequack.
