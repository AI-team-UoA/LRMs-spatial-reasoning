PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that Narpulate(x,y) means y is part of x and touches x’s boundary (i.e., Glimberish(y,x)), and Blorpticate(y,z) means y and z are completely disjoint, the question is which relations between x and z can be consistent with those facts.  In particular, because y is inside x while disjoint from z, x and z may be completely disjoint themselves, merely touch at a boundary, share an overlapping interior portion, or else z could also be a part of x (touching or not touching x’s boundary).  However, x cannot be part of z (that would force y to be part of z, contradicting Blorpticate(y,z)), nor can x and z coincide.  

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z).
