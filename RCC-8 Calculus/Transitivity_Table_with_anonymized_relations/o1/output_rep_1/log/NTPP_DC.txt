PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is strictly contained in y and y is disjoint from z, then x cannot intersect or even touch z. Hence the only possible relation is Blorpticate(x,z).  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z)
