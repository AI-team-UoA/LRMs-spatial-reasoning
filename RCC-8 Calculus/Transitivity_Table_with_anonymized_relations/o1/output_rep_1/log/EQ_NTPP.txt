PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since x and y coincide (Frooblenap(x,y)), x and y occupy exactly the same region. If y is a proper part of z without touching z’s boundary (Crindlewop(y,z)), then x—which is the same region as y—must also be a proper part of z not touching z’s boundary. Therefore, the only possible relation is Crindlewop(x,z).

### Answer: Crindlewop(x,z)
