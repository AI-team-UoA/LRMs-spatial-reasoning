PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x strictly contains y in its interior (Zindlequack(x,y)) and y merely touches z at a boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)), then x and z must at least share the boundary‐contact point (so they are not Blorpticate) and they cannot coincide (so not Frooblenap). All other six relations remain possible. In particular, x and z could:

• merely touch at a boundary (Snarfloon),  
• share some interior region (Twizzlump),  
• have one contained in the other (Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, or Zindlequack),  

depending on how x and z extend relative to one another.  

### Answer:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
