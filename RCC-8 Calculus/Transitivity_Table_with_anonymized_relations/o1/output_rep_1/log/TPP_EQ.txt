PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and z are coincident (Frooblenap(y,z)), then y and z occupy exactly the same region (including boundary). Since x is part of y and touches y’s boundary (Glimberish(x,y)), it follows that x is also part of z and touches z’s boundary. Hence the only possible relationship between x and z is Glimberish(x,z).

### Answer: Glimberish(x,z)
