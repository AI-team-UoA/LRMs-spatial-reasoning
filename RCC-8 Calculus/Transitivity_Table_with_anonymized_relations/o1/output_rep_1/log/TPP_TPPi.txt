PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Glimberish(x,y) tells us x is part of y and touches y’s boundary; Narpulate(y,z) is the same as Glimberish(z,y), so z is also part of y and touches y’s boundary.  Under these conditions, x and z can still be arranged in many ways inside y (from disjoint to overlapping to identical), but neither can lie entirely in the interior of the other (that would force one of them not to reach y’s boundary).  Consequently, the only impossible relations are the “completely interior” ones Crindlewop and Zindlequack.  All others remain possible:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Frooblenap(x,z)  

### Answer: Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, Narpulate, or Frooblenap.
