PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are coincident (Frooblenap(x,y)) and y is part of z, touching z’s boundary (Glimberish(y,z)), then x = y is likewise part of z and touches z’s boundary. Thus the only possible relation is Glimberish(x,z).  

### Answer: Glimberish(x,z)
