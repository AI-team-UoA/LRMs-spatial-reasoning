PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y share no spatial parts, and z is wholly part of y, then x and z also share no spatial parts. Therefore, the only possible relationship is Blorpticate(x,z).

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z)
