{"prompt": "If Zindlequack(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Because Zindlequack(x,y) is the same as Crindlewop(y,x), it follows that y is wholly in the interior of x (with no boundary contact). Frooblenap(y,z) means y and z coincide, so z occupies exactly the same region as y. Hence z is also wholly in the interior of x (with no boundary contact). That configuration corresponds uniquely to Zindlequack(x,z). \n\n### Answer: Zindlequack(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 28.40436863899231, "reasoning-tokens": 3328, "completion-tokens": 3473}
