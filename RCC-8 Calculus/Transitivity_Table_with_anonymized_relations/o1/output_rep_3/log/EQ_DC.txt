PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are coincident, then whatever spatial separation or connection y has with z must also hold for x and z. Since y and z are disconnected (Blorpticate), x and z are likewise disconnected. 

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z).
