PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Narpulate(x,y) holds, then y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x’s boundary). Frooblenap(y,z) means y and z are coincident (the same region). Hence z inherits exactly y’s spatial position with respect to x. Therefore z is also a tangential proper part of x. In the given terminology, that corresponds to Narpulate(x,z). No other relation is possible.

### Answer: Narpulate(x,z).
