PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y share no parts (Blorpticate(x,y)), then x cannot share any parts with a subpart of y. Since Narpulate(y,z) = Glimberish(z,y) says that z is part of y (touching yâ€™s boundary), z is wholly contained in y. Hence x must also share no parts with z. The only relation that asserts no shared parts is Blorpticate.  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z)
