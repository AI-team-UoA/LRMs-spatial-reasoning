PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Narpulate(x,y), then y is part of x and they share a boundary. If Snarfloon(y,z), then y and z share only a boundary and no interior. Because y is contained in x (with boundary contact) but only touches z on y’s boundary, the intersection between x and z can range from purely boundary contact (Snarfloon) to partial overlap (Twizzlump) to z being contained in x (Narpulate or Zindlequack). Concretely, the following four are all consistent possibilities for (x,z):  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)

### Answer: Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Narpulate, Zindlequack.
