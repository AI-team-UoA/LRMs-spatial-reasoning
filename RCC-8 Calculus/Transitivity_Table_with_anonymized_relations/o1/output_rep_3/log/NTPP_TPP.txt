PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is strictly in the interior of y (Crindlewop(x,y)) and y in turn touches z’s boundary (Glimberish(y,z)), then x cannot also reach z’s boundary (because that would require touching y’s boundary). By transitivity of parthood, x is part of z but does not touch z’s boundary. Hence:

### Answer: Crindlewop(x,z)
