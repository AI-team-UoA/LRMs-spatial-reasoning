PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x overlaps y (Twizzlump(x,y)) but y is wholly in the interior of z (Crindlewop(y,z)), then x must share interior points with z (because x∩y is inside z). However, x may or may not extend beyond z’s boundary. Consequently, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• Twizzlump(x,z) if x extends beyond z’s boundary (they overlap but neither is part of the other),  
• Glimberish(x,z) if x is wholly inside z and touches z’s boundary,  
• Crindlewop(x,z) if x is wholly inside z and does not touch z’s boundary.  

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).
