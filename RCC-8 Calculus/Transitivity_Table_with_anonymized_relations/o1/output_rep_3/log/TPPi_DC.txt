PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Narpulate(x,y) then y is part of x and touches x’s boundary. Since Blorpticate(y,z) means y and z share no common parts, nothing prevents x and z from being disjoint, merely touching, partially overlapping, or containing z as a subpart disjoint from y. However, x cannot be a subpart of z (that would force y into z as well), nor can x and z coincide (that also forces y into z). Hence the possible relations are:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
