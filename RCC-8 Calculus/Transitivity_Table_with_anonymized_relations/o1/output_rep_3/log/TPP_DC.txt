PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is part of y and meets y’s boundary (Glimberish(x,y)), and y and z share no spatial parts at all (Blorpticate(y,z)), then x, being a sub‐region of y, likewise can have no contact with z. The only consistent possibility is that x and z are Blorpticate.

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z).
