PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y merely touch at y’s boundary (Snarfloon) and y is wholly in the interior of z (Crindlewop), then x must at least intersect the interior of z at the point(s) where it meets y. Depending on whether x is wholly contained in z (and if so whether it meets z’s boundary) or partly extends outside, the possible relations are:

• Twizzlump(x,z) if x and z share an interior region but neither is part of the other.  
• Glimberish(x,z) if x is wholly contained in z and also touches z’s boundary.  
• Crindlewop(x,z) if x is wholly contained in z but does not touch z’s boundary.

### Answer: Twizzlump, Glimberish, or Crindlewop.
