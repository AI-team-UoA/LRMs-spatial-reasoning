PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Narpulate(x,y) means y is part of x (touching x’s boundary) and Narpulate(y,z) means z is part of y (touching y’s boundary), then z is necessarily part of x as well. Depending on whether z also meets x’s boundary or remains wholly in x’s interior, z is either part of x touching x’s boundary or part of x not touching x’s boundary. In the given vocabulary, those two cases are:

• Narpulate(x,z) (z is part of x and touches x’s boundary), or
• Zindlequack(x,z) (z is part of x but does not touch x’s boundary).

### Answer: Narpulate(x,z) or Zindlequack(x,z)
