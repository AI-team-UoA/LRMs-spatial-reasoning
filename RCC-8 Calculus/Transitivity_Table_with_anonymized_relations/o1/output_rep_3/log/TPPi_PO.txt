PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Narpulate(x,y), then by definition y is part of x and touches x’s boundary. Meanwhile, Twizzlump(y,z) means y and z share some interior but neither contains the other. Because y ⊆ x, any region y shares with z is also in x, so x and z must share interior points. This rules out Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), and Frooblenap(x,z). It also rules out x being part of z (i.e., Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z)), since that would force y to be part of z, contradicting Twizzlump(y,z). 

However, z might lie partly outside x (so x and z merely overlap, i.e., Twizzlump(x,z)), or z might lie wholly within x and either touch x’s boundary (i.e., Narpulate(x,z)) or not touch x’s boundary (i.e., Zindlequack(x,z)). Thus the possible relationships between x and z are:

• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
