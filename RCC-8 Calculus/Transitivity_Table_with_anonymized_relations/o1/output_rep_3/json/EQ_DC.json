{"prompt": "If Frooblenap(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y are coincident, then whatever spatial separation or connection y has with z must also hold for x and z. Since y and z are disconnected (Blorpticate), x and z are likewise disconnected. \n\n### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 11.696634292602539, "reasoning-tokens": 1088, "completion-tokens": 1157}
