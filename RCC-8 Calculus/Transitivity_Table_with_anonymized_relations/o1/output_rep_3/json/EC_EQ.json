{"prompt": "If Snarfloon(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If y and z coincide (Frooblenap(y,z)), then, from x\u2019s perspective, y and z are the same region. Therefore, if x Snarfloon\u2019s y (they share only a boundary but no interior), x must similarly Snarfloon z. No other relation is possible.\n\n### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 17.72972559928894, "reasoning-tokens": 1600, "completion-tokens": 1711}
