{"prompt": "If Crindlewop(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is wholly in the interior of y, and y is wholly in the interior of z, then x must also be wholly in the interior of z (and not touching z\u2019s boundary). The only relation consistent with that is Crindlewop(x,z). \n\n### Answer: Crindlewop(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 20.218276262283325, "reasoning-tokens": 1728, "completion-tokens": 1805}
