PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Zindlequack(x,y) means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This implies that the closure of y is contained entirely within the interior of x (cl(y) ⊆ int(x)).
Narpulate(y,z) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary. This implies that the closure of z is contained within the closure of y (cl(z) ⊆ cl(y)) and the boundary of z intersects the boundary of y (∂z ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅).

We want to find the possible relationships between x and z.
Since cl(y) ⊆ int(x) and cl(z) ⊆ cl(y), it follows that cl(z) ⊆ int(x).
If cl(z) is contained within the interior of x, then z is part of x.
Also, if cl(z) ⊆ int(x), then the boundary of z (∂z) must be contained within the interior of x (int(x)).
Since the interior of x and the boundary of x are disjoint (int(x) ∩ ∂x = ∅), it means that the boundary of z cannot intersect the boundary of x (∂z ∩ ∂x = ∅).

So, we have that z is part of x and the boundary of z does not touch the boundary of x.
This is the definition of Crindlewop(z,x).

The question asks for the relationship between x and z, which is R(x,z).
Crindlewop(z,x) is defined as Zindlequack(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is Zindlequack(x,z).
