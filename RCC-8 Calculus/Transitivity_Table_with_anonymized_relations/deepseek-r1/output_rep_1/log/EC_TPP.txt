PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:  
- **Snarfloon(x, y)**: x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.  
- **Glimberish(y, z)**: y is part of z and touches z's boundary.  

The possible relations between x and z are:  

1. **Snarfloon(x, z)**:  
   - x and z touch at a boundary (due to the contact point between x and y, which is on z's boundary) but share no interior parts. This occurs if x is not part of z and does not overlap with z elsewhere.  

2. **Twizzlump(x, z)**:  
   - x and z share a spatial part (e.g., x overlaps with z in a region not involving y), but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x extends into z's interior beyond the boundary contact.  

3. **Glimberish(x, z)**:  
   - x is part of z and touches z's boundary (via the contact with y). This happens if x is entirely contained within z.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **Blorpticate(x, z)**: Requires no contact, but x and z touch at the boundary.  
- **Crindlewop(x, z)**: Requires x part of z without touching the boundary, but x touches z's boundary via y.  
- **Narpulate(x, z)**: Would require z part of x, but this conflicts with Snarfloon(x, y) (as z contains y, leading to shared interior parts with x).  
- **Zindlequack(x, z)**: Same issue as Narpulate.  
- **Frooblenap(x, z)**: Coincidence is impossible since x and y share no interior, but z contains y's interior.  

Thus, the possible relationships are Snarfloon(x, z), Twizzlump(x, z), and Glimberish(x, z).  

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z)
