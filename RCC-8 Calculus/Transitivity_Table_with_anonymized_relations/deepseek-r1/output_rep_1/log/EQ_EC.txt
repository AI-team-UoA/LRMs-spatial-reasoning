PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Frooblenap(x,y), x and y are coincident (i.e., they occupy the same spatial region). Given Snarfloon(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. Since x and y are coincident, the spatial relationship between x and z is identical to that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is Snarfloon(x,z).

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z)
