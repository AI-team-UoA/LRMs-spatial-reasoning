PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- Twizzlump(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z’s boundary.

Possible relationships between x and z:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**:  
   - x and z share a spatial part (through the shared part with y, which is in z).  
   - Neither x nor z is part of the other. This occurs if x has a part outside z (since x is not part of y and y is only part of z, x may extend beyond z).

2. **Glimberish(x,z)**:  
   - x is part of z (x is entirely contained within z).  
   - x touches z’s boundary. This happens if the shared part between x and y includes a boundary point of z (since y touches z’s boundary).

3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**:  
   - x is part of z (x is entirely contained within z).  
   - x does not touch z’s boundary. This occurs if the shared part between x and y is interior to z and x has no boundary contact.

These are the only possibilities, as:
- x and z must share a part (via y), ruling out Blorpticate and Snarfloon.
- z cannot be part of x (since y is part of z but not part of x), ruling out Narpulate and Zindlequack.
- Frooblenap is impossible (x and z cannot be coincident, as x is not part of y and y is only part of z).

### Answer:  
Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop
