PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Frooblenap(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy the same spatial region. Given Crindlewop(y,z), y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x and y are coincident, x must also be part of z and not touch z's boundary. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is Crindlewop(x,z).

### Answer: Crindlewop(x,z)
