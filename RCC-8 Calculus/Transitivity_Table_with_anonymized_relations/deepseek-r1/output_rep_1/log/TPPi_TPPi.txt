PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given conditions are Narpulate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z).  
- Narpulate(x,y) means Glimberish(y,x), so y is part of x and y touches x's boundary.  
- Narpulate(y,z) means Glimberish(z,y), so z is part of y and z touches y's boundary.  

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be part of x (by transitivity of parthood). The possible relations between x and z depend on whether z touches the boundary of x:  
- If z touches the boundary of x, then Glimberish(z,x) holds. By definition, Narpulate(x,z) is equivalent to Glimberish(z,x), so Narpulate(x,z) is possible.  
- If z does not touch the boundary of x, then Crindlewop(z,x) holds. By definition, Zindlequack(x,z) is equivalent to Crindlewop(z,x), so Zindlequack(x,z) is possible.  

Both scenarios are feasible:  
1. **Example where z touches x's boundary**: x is a square, y is a small square at the corner of x sharing the corner point, and z is a point at that corner. Then z is part of x and touches x's boundary.  
2. **Example where z does not touch x's boundary**: x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x tangent to x's boundary, and z is a small circle inside y tangent to y's boundary but not to x's. Then z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- Blorpticate, Snarfloon: Require no shared parts or no shared interior, but z is part of x.  
- Twizzlump: Requires neither is part of the other, but z is part of x.  
- Glimberish(x,z): Requires x is part of z, but z is part of x and not vice versa (since y is a proper part of x and z is a proper part of y).  
- Crindlewop(x,z): Requires x is part of z, which is not true.  
- Frooblenap: Requires x and z are coincident (equal), but z is a proper part of x (as y is a proper part of x and z is a proper part of y).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are Narpulate and Zindlequack.
