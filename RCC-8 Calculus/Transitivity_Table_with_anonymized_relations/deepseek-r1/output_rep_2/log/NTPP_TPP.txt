PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Crindlewop(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z):  
- Crindlewop(x,y) means x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. Thus, x is strictly interior to y.  
- Glimberish(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z's boundary. Thus, y is contained in z and shares a boundary point with z.  

By transitivity of part-of:  
- x is part of y and y is part of z, so x is part of z.  

Consider the location of x relative to z:  
- Since x does not touch y's boundary, x lies entirely within the interior of y.  
- y touches z's boundary, but the interior of y is contained within the interior of z. This is because:  
  - Points in the interior of y are not on the boundary of y.  
  - Since y ⊆ z, these interior points of y are also in z.  
  - If such a point were on the boundary of z, it would imply it is on the boundary of y (due to y touching z's boundary), but x avoids y's boundary, so x avoids z's boundary.  
Thus, x lies entirely within the interior of z and does not touch z's boundary.  

This matches the definition of Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **Frooblenap(x,z)**: Requires x and z coincident, but x is a proper part of z.  
- **Glimberish(x,z)**: Requires x to touch z's boundary, but x avoids it.  
- **Narpulate(x,z)**: Same as Glimberish(z,x), but z cannot be part of x since x ⊆ z and x ≠ z.  
- **Zindlequack(x,z)**: Same as Crindlewop(z,x), but z cannot be part of x.  
- **Twizzlump(x,z)**: Requires sharing parts but neither part of the other, but x ⊆ z.  
- **Snarfloon(x,z)**: Requires touching boundaries without sharing interiors, but x and z share interior (x is part of z).  
- **Blorpticate(x,z)**: Requires no connection, but x is part of z.  

Thus, the only possible relation is Crindlewop(x,z).
