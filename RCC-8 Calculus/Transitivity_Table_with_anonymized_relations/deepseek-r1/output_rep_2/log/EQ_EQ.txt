PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that Frooblenap(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) hold, meaning x and y are coincident (occupy the same spatial region) and y and z are coincident, it follows that x and z must also be coincident. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is Frooblenap(x,z). No other relations in the set are possible because coincidence implies identical spatial extents.

### Answer: Frooblenap(x,z)
