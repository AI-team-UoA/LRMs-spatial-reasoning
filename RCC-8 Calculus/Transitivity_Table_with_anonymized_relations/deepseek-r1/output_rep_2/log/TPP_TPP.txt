PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Glimberish(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z), the following can be derived:
- Glimberish(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
- Glimberish(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches z's boundary.
- By transitivity of part-of, x is a proper part of z.

The relation between x and z depends on whether x touches z's boundary:
- If x touches z's boundary, then Glimberish(x,z) holds.
- If x does not touch z's boundary, then Crindlewop(x,z) holds.

Both scenarios are possible, depending on the spatial configuration:
- Example where Glimberish(x,z) holds: If y touches z's boundary at a point, and x touches y's boundary at that same point, then x may also touch z's boundary.
- Example where Crindlewop(x,z) holds: If y touches z's boundary at a point, but x touches y's boundary at an interior point of z (not on z's boundary), then x does not touch z's boundary.

No other relations are possible because:
- x is a proper part of z, so relations like Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Narpulate, Zindlequack, or Frooblenap cannot hold.
- Frooblenap requires coincidence, but x is a proper part of z, so they cannot be identical.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are Glimberish and Crindlewop.

### Answer:
Glimberish, Crindlewop
