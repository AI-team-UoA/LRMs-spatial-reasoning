PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and touches y’s boundary.
- Frooblenap(y,z): y and z are coincident (spatially identical).

Since y and z are coincident, they share the exact same spatial extent and boundary. Therefore:
- x is part of z (because x is part of y and y is coincident with z).
- x touches z’s boundary (because x touches y’s boundary and y’s boundary is identical to z’s boundary).

This satisfies the definition of Glimberish(x,z). No other relation is possible:
- Blorpticate: requires disconnection, but x is part of z.
- Snarfloon: requires no interior sharing, but x is part of z (sharing interior).
- Twizzlump: requires sharing parts without one being part of the other, but x is part of z.
- Crindlewop: requires x part of z without touching the boundary, but x touches the boundary.
- Narpulate: same as Glimberish(z,x), which would require z part of x, but here x is part of z and not vice versa (since x is a proper part of y, and thus z, due to Glimberish excluding coincidence).
- Zindlequack: same as Crindlewop(z,x), requiring z part of x without touching boundary, but z cannot be part of x if x is part of z unless coincident (which is not the case).
- Frooblenap: requires coincidence, but x is a proper part of z (as Glimberish(x,y) implies x is not the whole of y, hence not coincident with y or z).

Thus, the only possible relation is Glimberish(x,z).
