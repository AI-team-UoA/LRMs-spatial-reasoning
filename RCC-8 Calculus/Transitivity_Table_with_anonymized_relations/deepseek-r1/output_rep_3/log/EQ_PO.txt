PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Frooblenap(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy the exact same spatial region. Given Twizzlump(y,z), y and z share a spatial part but neither is part of the other.  

Since x is coincident with y, the spatial relationship between x and z must be identical to that between y and z. Therefore, x and z share a spatial part (the same one shared by y and z), and neither x is part of z nor z is part of x. This satisfies the definition of Twizzlump(x,z).  

No other relations are possible because:  
- Blorpticate is impossible (x and z share a part).  
- Snarfloon is impossible (x and z share interior parts, not just boundaries).  
- Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack are impossible (neither is part of the other).  
- Frooblenap is impossible (x and z are not coincident, as y and z are not coincident).  

Thus, the only possible relation is Twizzlump(x,z).
