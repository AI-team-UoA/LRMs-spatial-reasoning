PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that Blorpticate(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) hold, the spatial relationship between x and z is not constrained by these conditions. Since y is disconnected from both x and z and shares no spatial parts with either, x and z can exhibit any of the eight possible spatial relations relative to each other. Therefore, all eight relations are possible between x and z.

### Answer:
Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, Frooblenap
