PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- Glimberish(x, y) means x is part of y and touches y’s boundary.
- Crindlewop(y, z) means y is part of z and does not touch z’s boundary.

Analysis:
1. From Glimberish(x, y):  
   - x is part of y (so x ⊆ y).  
   - x touches y’s boundary.  
2. From Crindlewop(y, z):  
   - y is part of z (so y ⊆ z).  
   - y does not touch z’s boundary, meaning y is entirely in the interior of z.  

Since x ⊆ y and y ⊆ z, by transitivity, x is part of z (x ⊆ z).  

Now, consider if x touches z’s boundary:  
- y is entirely in the interior of z (no part of y touches z’s boundary).  
- x is part of y, so x is also entirely in the interior of z.  
- Therefore, x does not touch z’s boundary.  

Thus, x is part of z and does not touch z’s boundary, which matches the definition of **Crindlewop(x, z)**.  

Check other relations:  
- **Blorpticate(x, z)**: Disconnected – ruled out (x is part of z).  
- **Snarfloon(x, z)**: Touch at boundary only – ruled out (x is part of z and interior).  
- **Twizzlump(x, z)**: Share parts but neither part of the other – ruled out (x is part of z).  
- **Glimberish(x, z)**: x part of z and touches boundary – ruled out (x does not touch z’s boundary).  
- **Narpulate(x, z)**: Same as Glimberish(z, x) – ruled out (z is not part of x).  
- **Zindlequack(x, z)**: Same as Crindlewop(z, x) – ruled out (x is part of z, not vice versa).  
- **Frooblenap(x, z)**: Coincident – ruled out (x is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of z, so x ≠ z).  

No other relations are possible. The only relation is Crindlewop(x, z).  

### Answer: Crindlewop(x,z)
