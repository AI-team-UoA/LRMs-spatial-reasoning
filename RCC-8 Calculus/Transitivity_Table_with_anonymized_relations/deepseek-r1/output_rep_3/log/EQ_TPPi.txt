PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- Frooblenap(x,y) means x and y are coincident (spatially identical).
- Narpulate(y,z) is defined as Glimberish(z,y), meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since Frooblenap(x,y) implies x and y are coincident, we can substitute x for y. Thus, Narpulate(y,z) becomes equivalent to Narpulate(x,z).  
Narpulate(x,z) means Glimberish(z,x), which is: z is part of x and touches x's boundary.  

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Narpulate(x,z).  

No other relations are possible because:  
- Blorpticate: Disconnected (not possible, as z is part of x).  
- Snarfloon: Touch but no shared interior (not possible, as z is interior to x).  
- Twizzlump: Share a part but neither is part of the other (not possible, as z is part of x).  
- Glimberish(x,z): Would require x is part of z (not possible, as z is part of x and proper).  
- Crindlewop(x,z): Would require x is part of z and not touching boundary (not possible, as z is part of x).  
- Zindlequack(x,z): Would require z is part of x and not touching boundary (contradicts boundary touching).  
- Frooblenap(x,z): Coincident (not possible, as z is a proper part of x).  

Thus, the only possible relationship is Narpulate(x,z).  

### Answer: Narpulate(x,z)
