PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this systematically. We are given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's recap all of our relations:
1. Blorpticate(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
3. Twizzlump(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. Crindlewop(x,y): x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
6. Narpulate(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary (same as Glimberish(y,x)).
7. Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary (same as Crindlewop(y,x)).
8. Frooblenap(x,y): x and y are coincident (identical).

Now, let's think about the spatial arrangement:
- x touches y at a boundary
- y is part of z and touches z's boundary

From this, we can deduce several things:
1. Since y is part of z, any part of y is also part of z or at least touches z.
2. Since x touches y at a boundary and y touches z's boundary, there are a few possibilities:
   a. x could be entirely outside of z and only touch z at the boundary where y also touches z.
   b. x could be partially inside z, with some parts of x overlapping with z.
   c. x could be entirely inside z but not entirely overlap with y.
   d. x could be identical to z (unlikely given the constraints).

Let's consider each relation and determine if it's possible for x and z:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Given that x touches y at a boundary and y is part of z, it's not possible for x and z to be completely disconnected. There must be at least a boundary touching point between x and z.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is definitely possible. If x touches y at a boundary and y touches z's boundary, then x can touch z at a boundary too, without sharing interior parts with z.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible. If x overlaps with z, but neither is fully contained in the other, this relation holds.

4. Glimberish(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. If x is contained within z and touches z's boundary (which could be through the part of y that touches z's boundary), this relation holds.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible. If x is entirely contained within z but is surrounded by other parts of z that don't include y, then x wouldn't touch z's boundary.

6. Narpulate(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This seems unlikely. Given that y is part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, it's hard to see how z could be contained within x. 

7. Zindlequack(x,z): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this seems unlikely for the same reason as above.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This also seems unlikely. If x only touches y at a boundary and y is part of z, it's hard to see how x and z could be identical.

So based on this reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

But I feel like I might be missing something or overlooking a constraint. Let me double check my reasoning.

Let's think more carefully about the constraints:

Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

If y is part of z, then y is contained within z or coincident with z. Given that Glimberish(y,z) specifies that y touches z's boundary, y is not coincident with z. So, y is a proper part of z.

Now, x touches y at a boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y. This means that x is outside of y, but they have a common boundary.

Given that y is inside z and touches z's boundary, when x touches y at a boundary, there are several possibilities:
1. x touches y at a part of y's boundary that also coincides with z's boundary. In this case, x would also touch z at a boundary, giving us Snarfloon(x,z).
2. x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is inside z. In this case, x penetrates z's boundary, sharing some interior parts with z, giving us Twizzlump(x,z).
3. x is fully contained within z. This could be Glimberish(x,z) if x touches z's boundary or Crindlewop(x,z) if it doesn't.

Let me reconsider Narpulate(x,z), which is the same as Glimberish(z,x). This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, it's hard to see how z could be a proper part of x. I'm still inclined to say Narpulate(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly for Zindlequack(x,z), which is the same as Crindlewop(z,x), it would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, given that y is a proper part of z, it's hard to see how z could be a proper part of x.

For Frooblenap(x,z), which means x and z are coincident, this would mean x is the same as z. But we know x only touches y at a boundary, and y is a proper part of z. It's hard to see how x could be the same as z, so I'm inclined to say Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this re-examination, I believe the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let me double-check one more time.

So, given Snarfloon(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z), let's think about a concrete example:

Imagine x and y as two circles that touch at a point, representing Snarfloon(x,y). Now, y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, representing Glimberish(y,z). So, z is a larger shape that contains y, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, if x touches y at a point, and that point is also on the boundary of z, then x would also touch z at a point, giving us Snarfloon(x,z).

If x touches y at a point, but that point is inside z (not on z's boundary), then x penetrates z's boundary, sharing some interior parts with z, giving us Twizzlump(x,z).

If x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary, then we have Glimberish(x,z).

If x is fully contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then we have Crindlewop(x,z).

I don't see how any of the other relations could hold.

Blorpticate(x,z) would mean x and z are disconnected, which contradicts the fact that x touches y and y is part of z.

Narpulate(x,z) would mean z is a proper part of x, which contradicts the fact that y is a proper part of z and x only touches y at a boundary.

Zindlequack(x,z) would mean z is a proper part of x, which again contradicts the fact that y is a proper part of z and x only touches y at a boundary.

Frooblenap(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident, which contradicts the fact that y is a proper part of z and x only touches y at a boundary.

So, I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

Actually, now that I think about it some more, I'm not sure that all of these are possible. Let me re-evaluate for each possible relation:

Snarfloon(x,z): We have Snarfloon(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z). If y touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then it's possible that x also touches z's boundary. So Snarfloon(x,z) is possible.

Twizzlump(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part but neither is part of the other. If x extends into z, but not fully contained in z, this can happen. This could occur if x touches y at a boundary, but that boundary point is inside z (not on z's boundary). So Twizzlump(x,z) is possible.

Glimberish(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary, this can happen. This could occur if x is inside z and touches the boundary of z at the same point where y touches z's boundary. So Glimberish(x,z) is possible.

Crindlewop(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is fully contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary, this can happen. But I'm not sure if this is consistent with our constraints. If x touches y at a boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then I'm having trouble visualizing a scenario where x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

I think I need to be more careful here. Let's think about it step by step:

Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

Blorpticate(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since x touches y and y is part of z, x and z must at least share a boundary point. So this is not possible.

Snarfloon(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. If x touches y at a boundary point, and that point is also on z's boundary, then x and z would touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts. This is possible.

Let me try to visualize this more carefully. If x touches y at a boundary point, and y touches z's boundary, then there are a few cases to consider:

1. x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on z's boundary. In this case, x also touches z at a boundary, and we have Snarfloon(x,z).

2. x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is not on z's boundary. This point is inside z. In this case, x and z share some interior parts, but it's not clear if one is a part of the other.

Let's see: if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is inside z, then x must extend into z, but also have parts outside of z. This gives us Twizzlump(x,z).

3. x is fully contained within z. This could happen if x is small and touches y at a point inside z. This would be either Glimberish(x,z) if x touches z's boundary, or Crindlewop(x,z) if it doesn't.

But I'm still not sure about Crindlewop(x,z). Let me reconsider:

If x touches y at a boundary, and y touches z's boundary, can x be inside z without touching z's boundary?

Actually, I think this is possible. Imagine y as a small circle inside a larger circle z, where y touches the boundary of z at a point. Now, imagine x as another small circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary, but this point is not the point where y touches z's boundary. If x is small enough to be fully contained within z, and x doesn't extend to z's boundary, then we have Crindlewop(x,z).

So, I believe Crindlewop(x,z) is also possible.

Now, let's reconsider the other relations:

Narpulate(x,z): This is the same as Glimberish(z,x), meaning z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is a proper part of z, if z is a proper part of x, then y must also be a proper part of x. But we know Snarfloon(x,y), which means x and y only touch at a boundary. This is a contradiction. So Narpulate(x,z) is not possible.

Zindlequack(x,z): This is the same as Crindlewop(z,x), meaning z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this would mean y is also a proper part of x, which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y). So Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

Frooblenap(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. But we know y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary. If x and z were coincident, then x would also contain y as a proper part, which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y). So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

Wait, let me double check Crindlewop(x,z) one more time. This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. 

Let's reconsider: we have Snarfloon(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z). Snarfloon(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Glimberish(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Can x be part of z but not touch z's boundary?

If x touches y at a boundary, and y touches z's boundary, it's still possible for x to be inside z without touching z's boundary. This would happen if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is not the point where y touches z's boundary, and x is small enough to be fully contained within z without reaching z's boundary.

So, Crindlewop(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, I should really draw these out to make sure I'm not missing something:

Snarfloon(x,z): 
- x touches z at a boundary but they don't share interior parts.
- This can happen if x touches y at a boundary point that's also on z's boundary.

Twizzlump(x,z): 
- x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- This can happen if x extends into z (by touching y at a point inside z), but also has parts outside of z.

Glimberish(x,z): 
- x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- This can happen if x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary, possibly at the same point where y touches z's boundary.

Crindlewop(x,z): 
- x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
- This can happen if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's inside z (not at the point where y touches z's boundary), and x is small enough to be fully contained within z without reaching z's boundary.

Let's continue:

Narpulate(x,z): 
- z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- This would mean y is also part of x (since y is part of z), which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y).

Zindlequack(x,z): 
- z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Again, this would mean y is part of x, which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y).

Frooblenap(x,z): 
- x and z are coincident.
- This would mean x contains y as a proper part, which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

I'm now confident in this answer.

Actually, I just realized that I've been a bit imprecise in my thinking. I've been mostly thinking about point contacts, but the problem statement doesn't specify that. It just says "touching at a boundary," which could mean the entities share a boundary segment or surface, not just a point.

But this doesn't change my conclusions. The possible relationships between x and z are still:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

Actually I notice I've been misunderstanding one of the constraints. Let me revise my answer:

Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider each possible relation between x and z:

Blorpticate(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, can x and z be disconnected? No, because at the very least, x and z would share the boundary point where x touches y. So Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

Snarfloon(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, then x also touches z at a boundary. But do they share interior parts? If x and y don't share interior parts, and y is part of z, then x and z might not share interior parts either. So Snarfloon(x,z) is possible.

Twizzlump(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, then there's a boundary point of y that is both part of x and part of z. However, this is just a boundary point, not an interior part, so x and z don't share an interior part based on this. But it's still possible for x and z to overlap in other ways, with neither being part of the other. So Twizzlump(x,z) is possible.

Glimberish(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, it's possible for x to be fully contained within z and to touch z's boundary (which could be through the point where x touches y, if that point is also on z's boundary). So Glimberish(x,z) is possible.

Crindlewop(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, it's possible for x to be fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, especially if the point where x touches y is inside z. So Crindlewop(x,z) is possible.

Narpulate(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. If y is part of z, and z is part of x, then y is part of x, which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y). So Narpulate(x,z) is not possible.

Zindlequack(x,z): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this would imply that y is part of x, which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y). So Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

Frooblenap(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, and y is part of z, then y is part of x, which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y). So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

But there's one more thing to consider. If x touches y at a boundary, and y touches z's boundary, it's possible that the point where x touches y is the same point where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x would also touch z's boundary, which aligns with Snarfloon(x,z) or Glimberish(x,z), depending on whether x is part of z.

But if the point where x touches y is not the same as the point where y touches z's boundary, then x might be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, which aligns with Crindlewop(x,z).

Or, x might extend outside of z, with some parts inside z and some outside, which aligns with Twizzlump(x,z).

So, I believe my final conclusion is correct.

Actually, thinking more carefully about Twizzlump(x,z). This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, does that necessarily mean x and z share a spatial part? If they just touch at a boundary, they don't share an interior part. But for Twizzlump, they need to share a spatial part.

Actually in the problem statement it says that Twizzlump(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. So they need to share a spatial part, which is more than just touching at a boundary.

But I think Twizzlump(x,z) is still possible. If x extends into z (perhaps through the point where x touches y), but is not fully contained in z, then x and z would share a spatial part, but neither would be part of the other.

Let me revisit this once more. Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

For Twizzlump(x,z) to be possible, x and z need to share a spatial part. If x only touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, does that mean x and z share a spatial part?

Actually I'm realizing that "x and y touch at a boundary" can be ambiguous. It could mean they share a boundary, or it could mean one of them has a boundary point that is also a point of the other. Let's interpret it as them sharing a boundary segment.

If x and y share a boundary segment, then this segment is part of both x and y. Since y is part of z, this boundary segment is also part of z. So, x and z share this boundary segment, which is a spatial part. Does this mean Twizzlump(x,z) is possible?

But wait, sharing a boundary doesn't mean they share an interior part. And it's not clear if "sharing a spatial part" for Twizzlump requires sharing an interior part or if sharing a boundary segment is sufficient.

Let's reconsider. The problem states that "Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts." This implies that when entities "touch at a boundary," they don't share interior parts. Now, for Twizzlump, it says "x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other." This suggests they share more than just a boundary—they overlap in their interiors.

Given this interpretation, if x and y only touch at a boundary, they don't overlap in their interiors. So, for Twizzlump(x,z) to be possible, x and z would need to overlap in their interiors.

If x and y only touch at a boundary, and y is part of z, does that mean x and z overlap in their interiors? Not necessarily. If the part of x that touches y is just a boundary segment, then x and z would only share a boundary, not an interior.

However, it's still possible for x and z to overlap in their interiors through some other means. For instance, if x extends into z (not through the boundary point/segment where x touches y, but through some other part), then x and z would share an interior part, making Twizzlump(x,z) possible.

But given the constraints of Snarfloon(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z), it's not clear if this is possible. I think I'm overthinking this.

Let's re-analyze. Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

From these, it's clear that:
1. x and y don't share interior parts.
2. y is contained within z.

Let's systematically consider each relation for x and z:

Blorpticate(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since x touches y and y is part of z, x and z cannot be disconnected. So Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

Snarfloon(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Given that x touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, x would also touch z at a boundary. If x doesn't extend into z, then x and z don't share interior parts. So Snarfloon(x,z) is possible.

Twizzlump(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. For this to be true, x and z would need to overlap in their interiors. But if x only touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z, does that mean x and z share an interior part? 

Actually, it's possible. If x extends into z (not through y, but through some other part), then x and z would share an interior part. But is this consistent with our constraints? I think it can be. For instance, if x touches y at a boundary, but has another part that extends into z, then Twizzlump(x,z) would be possible.

Glimberish(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is small and is fully contained within z, touching z's boundary, then Glimberish(x,z) would be true. This is possible.

Crindlewop(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if x is small and is fully contained within z, not touching z's boundary, then Crindlewop(x,z) would be true. This is also possible.

Narpulate(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. If z is part of x, then y (which is part of z) would also be part of x. But we know that x and y only touch at a boundary and don't share interior parts, which contradicts y being part of x. So Narpulate(x,z) is not possible.

Zindlequack(x,z): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this would imply that y is part of x, which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y). So Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

Frooblenap(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, and y is part of z, then y would be part of x. But this contradicts Snarfloon(x,y). So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

But after reflecting on Twizzlump(x,z), I'm still a bit unsure.  Let me see if I can convince myself one way or the other.

Let's consider a scenario: Imagine x and y as two entities that touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Then, y is part of a larger entity z and touches z's boundary. If x extends into z in a way that it shares an interior part with z, but neither is fully contained in the other, then Twizzlump(x,z) would be true.

Is this consistent with our constraints? Yes, it can be. For instance, if x touches y at a boundary, but has another part that extends into z, then Twizzlump(x,z) would be possible.

For example:
- Imagine y as a small circle inside a larger circle z, where y touches z's boundary at a point.
- Now, imagine x as a crescent shape that touches y at a point on y's boundary, but also extends inside z, sharing an interior part with z.
- In this scenario, Snarfloon(x,y) is true because x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- Glimberish(y,z) is true because y is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- Twizzlump(x,z) is true because x and z share an interior part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

So, Twizzlump(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

Actually, I've been thinking too much about this. Let's go back to the basics. I don't think the problem is as complicated as I'm making it. 

Let's visualize it: 
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary, but don't share any interior parts. So x is outside of y, but they touch at a boundary.
- Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary. So y is inside z, but touches the boundary of z.

Now, given these, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. x could be outside of z, touching z's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary. This gives us Snarfloon(x,z).
2. x could be partially inside z. That is, part of x is inside z and part is outside. This gives us Twizzlump(x,z).
3. x could be fully inside z and touch z's boundary (possibly at the same point where y touches z's boundary). This gives us Glimberish(x,z).
4. x could be fully inside z and not touch z's boundary. This gives us Crindlewop(x,z).

I think these are the only possibilities. Given that y is inside z, and x touches y at a boundary, x cannot be completely outside z and not touch z's boundary (Blorpticate). And given that x touches y only at a boundary, x cannot contain z (Narpulate, Zindlequack) or be the same as z (Frooblenap).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)

And I'm sticking with this answer.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given Snarfloon(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z).

First, let me understand what these relations tell us:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts
- Glimberish(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Given this setup, let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): Not possible. Since x touches y and y is part of z, x and z cannot be completely disconnected.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at a boundary point that also happens to be on z's boundary, then x would touch z at a boundary without sharing interior parts.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): Possible. If x partially extends into z (beyond just the boundary point where it touches y), then x and z would share spatial parts without either being contained in the other.

4. Glimberish(x,z): Possible. If x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary (possibly at the same point where y touches z's boundary), this relation holds.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): Possible. If x is fully contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary, this relation holds.

6. Narpulate(x,z): Not possible. This would mean z is part of x, which contradicts the fact that y is part of z while x only touches y at a boundary.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): Not possible. Like Narpulate, this would require z to be part of x, contradicting our premises.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were coincident, and y is part of z, then y would be part of x, contradicting Snarfloon(x,y).

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z)
