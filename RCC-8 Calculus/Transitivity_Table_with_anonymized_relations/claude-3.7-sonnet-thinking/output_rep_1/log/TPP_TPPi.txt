PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know:
- Glimberish(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- Narpulate(y,z) is the same as Glimberish(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary

So we have:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary

Both x and z are parts of y and both touch y's boundary. What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's consider all the possible relationships:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
   This is possible. x and z could be separate parts of y, both touching y's boundary but not touching each other.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
   This is also possible. x and z could be separate parts of y that touch at their boundaries.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
   This is possible too. x and z could partially overlap within y.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
   This is possible. x could be a part of z, and z could be a part of y.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
   This is possible. x could be a part of z that's completely in z's interior.

6. Narpulate(x,z): Same as Glimberish(z,x), meaning z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
   This is possible. z could be a part of x, and x could be a part of y.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): Same as Crindlewop(z,x), meaning z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
   This is possible. z could be a part of x that's completely in x's interior.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This is possible. x and z could be the same spatial region.

Wait, let me think more carefully. I need to be more precise about the constraints.

Glimberish(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
Narpulate(y,z) means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So x and z are both parts of y, and both touch y's boundary.

Let's reconsider each relation:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): This requires x and z to be disconnected. Since both touch y's boundary, they could be on opposite sides or different parts of y's boundary, not touching each other. So Blorpticate(x,z) is possible.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): This requires x and z to touch at a boundary but not share interior. Since both touch y's boundary, they could touch each other at some point on y's boundary. So Snarfloon(x,z) is possible.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): This requires x and z to partially overlap. Both could extend inward from y's boundary and overlap in some region. So Twizzlump(x,z) is possible.

4. Glimberish(x,z): This requires x to be part of z and touch z's boundary. Since z is part of y, x would also be part of y (which we know). If z extends from y's boundary inward, and x is along the edge of z, this would satisfy both conditions. So Glimberish(x,z) is possible.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): This requires x to be part of z and not touch z's boundary. Since both x and z touch y's boundary, if z extends deeper into y than x does, and x is completely inside z except at y's boundary, this would work. So Crindlewop(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful about Crindlewop(x,z). If x touches y's boundary and is part of z, and z also touches y's boundary, then x must touch z's boundary at some point (specifically, at y's boundary). So actually, Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

Let me continue:

6. Narpulate(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Similar to the Glimberish case, if x extends deeper into y than z does, and z is along the edge of x, this works. So Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): This means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since z touches y's boundary and is part of x, and x also touches y's boundary, z must touch x's boundary at some point (at y's boundary). So Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): This means x and z are identical. If x and z are the same region within y, both touching y's boundary, this works. So Frooblenap(x,z) is possible.

But I need to think more carefully about Crindlewop(x,z) and Zindlequack(x,z).

For Crindlewop(x,z), I said it's not possible because if x touches y's boundary and is part of z, and z also touches y's boundary, then x must touch z's boundary. But this isn't necessarily true. It's possible that x touches y's boundary at a different place than where z touches y's boundary. In that case, if x is entirely within z except for the part where it touches y's boundary, and that part of y's boundary is also z's boundary, then x doesn't touch z's boundary. Actually, no, that doesn't work either, because that part of y's boundary is also z's boundary, so x would be touching z's boundary there. So Crindlewop(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, for Zindlequack(x,z), if z touches y's boundary and is part of x, and x also touches y's boundary, then z must touch x's boundary at some point (at y's boundary). So Zindlequack(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Wait, I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider this more carefully.

Glimberish(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
Narpulate(y,z) means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So x and z are both parts of y, and both touch y's boundary.

Let's consider each relation one by one:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since both touch y's boundary, they could be on opposite sides or different parts of y's boundary, not touching each other. So Blorpticate(x,z) is possible.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Since both touch y's boundary, they could touch each other at some point on y's boundary. So Snarfloon(x,z) is possible.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Both could extend inward from y's boundary and overlap in some region. So Twizzlump(x,z) is possible.

4. Glimberish(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Since z is part of y, if x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary, it would satisfy both conditions. So Glimberish(x,z) is possible.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): This means x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) but still touches y's boundary, this would mean that the part of y's boundary that x touches is not part of z's boundary. But since z is part of y and touches y's boundary, any part of y's boundary that z touches is also z's boundary. So if x touches y's boundary at a point where z also touches y's boundary, then x touches z's boundary. 

   However, x could touch y's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch y's boundary. In that case, x would be touching a part of y's boundary that isn't part of z's boundary, so x would not be touching z's boundary. But that contradicts the fact that z touches y's boundary, because we know from Narpulate(y,z) that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

   Actually, the part I'm confusing myself on is this: "If x touches y's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch y's boundary." This is possible. Just because z touches y's boundary doesn't mean it touches ALL of y's boundary. So x could touch y's boundary at a point where z doesn't.

   But here's the issue: if x is part of z (which Crindlewop(x,z) requires), and x touches y's boundary, then z also touches y's boundary at that point (because x is part of z). So x and z touch y's boundary at the same point, which means x touches z's boundary. This contradicts Crindlewop(x,z), which requires x to not touch z's boundary.

   So Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

6. Narpulate(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. If z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary, it would satisfy both conditions. So Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): This means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. By similar reasoning to Crindlewop(x,z), if z touches y's boundary and is part of x, and x also touches y's boundary, then z touches x's boundary. So Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): This means x and z are identical. If x and z are the same region within y, both touching y's boundary, this works. So Frooblenap(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I'm getting confused on the boundary definitions. Let me think more carefully.

Crindlewop(x,z) means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
Zindlequack(x,z) means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

We know:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary (Glimberish(x,y))
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary (Narpulate(y,z))

For Crindlewop(x,z) to be true, x must be part of z and not touch z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary (which we know it does) and is part of z, then that part of y's boundary that x touches must not be part of z's boundary. But if z is part of y and that part of y's boundary is not part of z's boundary, then z doesn't touch y's boundary at that point.

Wait, that's not necessarily a contradiction. z could touch y's boundary at a different point. So it's still possible for x to touch y's boundary at a point where z doesn't, and for z to touch y's boundary at a point where x doesn't.

Let's visualize this with a simple example. Imagine y is a square, and z is a smaller square inside y that touches y's boundary on the left side. Now, x could be an even smaller square inside z that touches y's boundary on the left side as well, but not at the same point as z. In this case, x would be part of z, but it wouldn't touch z's boundary because the only part of x that touches any boundary is the part that touches y's boundary, and that part of y's boundary is not part of z's boundary.

Wait, that doesn't work. If x touches y's boundary and is part of z, then z must also touch y's boundary at that point (because x is part of z). So x and z touch y's boundary at the same point, which means x touches z's boundary. This contradicts Crindlewop(x,z), which requires x to not touch z's boundary.

For Zindlequack(x,z) to be true, z must be part of x and not touch x's boundary. If z touches y's boundary (which we know it does) and is part of x, then that part of y's boundary that z touches must not be part of x's boundary. But if x is part of y and that part of y's boundary is not part of x's boundary, then x doesn't touch y's boundary at that point. But we know x touches y's boundary, so this is a contradiction.

Let me verify this with a different approach. The key insight is this: if a region (call it A) touches the boundary of a larger region (call it B), and A is part of another region (call it C) which is also part of B, then A touches the boundary of C.

Let's apply this to our scenario:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary (Glimberish(x,y))
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary (Narpulate(y,z))

1. For Crindlewop(x,z) to be true, x must be part of z and not touch z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary (which we know it does) and x is part of z, then by the key insight, x must touch z's boundary. This contradicts Crindlewop(x,z), so it's not possible.

2. For Zindlequack(x,z) to be true, z must be part of x and not touch x's boundary. If z touches y's boundary (which we know it does) and z is part of x, then by the key insight, z must touch x's boundary. This contradicts Zindlequack(x,z), so it's not possible.

But I'm still not 100% confident in this reasoning. Let me think about it from yet another angle.

The key is to understand what it means for a region to touch the boundary of another region. A region A touches the boundary of region B if there's at least one point that's both in A and on the boundary of B.

Now, let's think about what it means for x to touch y's boundary but not z's boundary, given that x is part of z and z is part of y.

If x touches y's boundary, it means there's a point p that's both in x and on the boundary of y. Since x is part of z, p is also in z. And since p is on the boundary of y and z is part of y, p is either in the interior of z or on the boundary of z. If p is on the boundary of z, then x touches z's boundary, which contradicts Crindlewop(x,z). So p must be in the interior of z.

But if p is in the interior of z, it can't be on the boundary of y (because if it were, it would be on the boundary of z, since z is part of y). This contradicts our premise that p is on the boundary of y.

So, Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

By similar reasoning, Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

Let me recap what I've discovered:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): Possible. x and z could be separate parts of y, both touching y's boundary but not touching each other.
2. Snarfloon(x,z): Possible. x and z could be separate parts of y that touch at their boundaries.
3. Twizzlump(x,z): Possible. x and z could partially overlap within y.
4. Glimberish(x,z): Possible. x could be a part of z, and both could touch y's boundary.
5. Crindlewop(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.
6. Narpulate(x,z): Possible. z could be a part of x, and both could touch y's boundary.
7. Zindlequack(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.
8. Frooblenap(x,z): Possible. x and z could be the same spatial region.

Actually, let me think again, really carefully. I think I might have been over-complicating this.

Glimberish(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
Narpulate(y,z) means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Focusing on the "part of" relationship, we know:
- x is part of y
- z is part of y

This doesn't tell us much about the relationship between x and z, except that they're both parts of y. They could be separate, overlap, one could be part of the other, or they could be identical.

Now, focusing on the "touches boundary" part:
- x touches y's boundary
- z touches y's boundary

Again, this doesn't constrain the relationship between x and z much. They could both touch y's boundary at different points, at the same point, or along a shared segment.

Let's reconsider each relationship:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected. They could be separate parts of y, both touching y's boundary but at different points. Possible.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior. They could be adjacent parts of y, both touching y's boundary. Possible.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z partially overlap. They could both extend from y's boundary and overlap in some region. Possible.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. If z is a larger part of y than x, and x is along the edge of z (which could include where z touches y's boundary), this works. Possible.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For this to be true, x would need to be completely in the interior of z, not touching z's boundary. But we know x touches y's boundary. If x touches y's boundary at a point where z also touches y's boundary, then x touches z's boundary, which contradicts Crindlewop(x,z). If x touches y's boundary at a point where z doesn't, then that part of y's boundary is not part of z, which means z doesn't contain x at that point, contradicting our premise that x is part of z. So, Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

6. Narpulate(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. If x is a larger part of y than z, and z is along the edge of x (which could include where x touches y's boundary), this works. Possible.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. By similar reasoning to Crindlewop(x,z), if z touches y's boundary and is part of x, then z must touch x's boundary, contradicting Zindlequack(x,z). So, Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are identical. If x and z are the same region within y, both touching y's boundary at the same points, this works. Possible.

So, the possible relationships are:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Glimberish(x,z)
6. Narpulate(x,z)
8. Frooblenap(x,z)

Ok, actually I think I need to be even more careful about the boundary issues. Let me just focus on Crindlewop(x,z) for now.

Crindlewop(x,z) means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
We know:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary (Glimberish(x,y))
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary (Narpulate(y,z))

For Crindlewop(x,z) to be true, x must be part of z and not touch z's boundary. Let's consider what this means geometrically.

If x is part of z, then any point in x is also in z. And if x touches y's boundary, it means there's a point p that's both in x and on the boundary of y. Since p is in x, and x is part of z, p is also in z. And since p is on the boundary of y and z is part of y, p is either in the interior of z or on the boundary of z.

If p is on the boundary of z, then x touches z's boundary, which contradicts Crindlewop(x,z). So p must be in the interior of z.

But if p is in the interior of z, it can't be on the boundary of y (because if it were, it would be on the boundary of z, since z is part of y and touches y's boundary at p). This contradicts our premise that p is on the boundary of y.

Actually, I think I'm getting too abstract. Let me try to visualize a concrete scenario.

Imagine y is a square, and z is a smaller square inside y that touches y's boundary on the left side. Now, can we have a region x that's part of z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary?

If x touches y's boundary, it means there's a point p that's both in x and on the boundary of y. Since x is part of z, p is also in z. And since p is on the boundary of y and z touches y's boundary at p, p is on the boundary of z. This means x touches z's boundary, which contradicts Crindlewop(x,z).

So, it seems Crindlewop(x,z) is indeed not possible.

By similar reasoning, Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

So my earlier answer is correct. The possible relationships are:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Glimberish(x,z)
6. Narpulate(x,z)
8. Frooblenap(x,z)

But wait, I think there's a flaw in my reasoning.

Just because z touches y's boundary doesn't mean it touches it at every point where x touches y's boundary. z could touch y's boundary at one point, and x could touch y's boundary at a different point. In that case, x could be part of z, touch y's boundary, but not touch z's boundary.

Let me construct a concrete example: Imagine y as a square, z as a smaller square inside y that touches y's boundary at the top left corner, and x as an even smaller square inside z that touches y's boundary at the top right corner (and nowhere else). In this scenario, x is part of z (Crindlewop(x,z) requires), x touches y's boundary (Glimberish(x,y) requires), and z touches y's boundary (Narpulate(y,z) requires). But x doesn't touch z's boundary, which is what Crindlewop(x,z) requires.

Wait, that doesn't work. If x is a smaller square inside z and touches y's boundary at the top right corner, then z must also extend to the top right corner (since x is part of z). But then z would be touching y's boundary at both the top left and top right corners.

Actually, let me re-examine my setup. I'm a bit concerned I've misunderstood the problem. I'll reread the definitions.

Blorpticate(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
Twizzlump(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
Glimberish(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
Crindlewop(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
Narpulate(x,y) is the same as Glimberish(y,x). So this means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
Zindlequack(x,y) is the same as Crindlewop(y,x). So this means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
Frooblenap(x,y) means that x and y are coincident. This means that x and y are the same region.

So in our problem, we have:
- Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Wait, no, I'm confused. I'm not reading the problem correctly. Let me reread the problem.

Actually, I am. Narpulate(y,z) is the same as Glimberish(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Ah. So one more time:
- Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- Narpulate(y,z): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

OK so that is the correct starting point.

Now, for Crindlewop(x,z) to be true, x must be part of z and not touch z's boundary.

Let's try to construct a concrete example:
- y is a square
- z is a smaller square inside y that touches y's boundary at the top left corner
- x is a point inside z that touches y's boundary at the top left corner

In this scenario, x is part of z (as required by Crindlewop(x,z)), x touches y's boundary (as required by Glimberish(x,y)), and z touches y's boundary (as required by Narpulate(y,z)). But does x touch z's boundary?

If x is a point on y's boundary, and z also touches y's boundary at that point, then x is on z's boundary. This contradicts Crindlewop(x,z), which requires x to not touch z's boundary.

It seems like I can't construct a valid example for Crindlewop(x,z).

Let's try with a more abstract approach. If x is part of z and touches y's boundary, and z is part of y and touches y's boundary, then x and z both have points on y's boundary. If x touches y's boundary at a point where z also touches y's boundary, then x touches z's boundary, which contradicts Crindlewop(x,z).

So, for Crindlewop(x,z) to be possible, x would need to touch y's boundary at a point where z doesn't. But if x is part of z, any point in x is also in z. So if x touches y's boundary at a point, z also touches y's boundary at that point. This means x must touch z's boundary, contradicting Crindlewop(x,z).

Therefore, Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

By similar reasoning, Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

So my answer is:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Glimberish(x,z)
6. Narpulate(x,z)
8. Frooblenap(x,z)

Wait I'm still confused on Crindlewop. Let me try a different approach.

Crindlewop(x,z) means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

We know:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary (Glimberish(x,y))
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary (Narpulate(y,z))

Let's define what it means for x to touch y's boundary: There's a point p that's in x and on the boundary of y.

Now, for Crindlewop(x,z) to be true, x must be part of z but not touch z's boundary. But we know x touches y's boundary at point p. Since x is part of z, p is also in z. And since p is on the boundary of y and z is part of y, p is either on the boundary of z or in the interior of z.

Let's consider both cases:
1. If p is on the boundary of z, then x touches z's boundary, which contradicts Crindlewop(x,z).
2. If p is in the interior of z, then p can't be on the boundary of y, because if it were, it would be on the boundary of z (since z is part of y and touches y's boundary at p). This contradicts our premise that p is on the boundary of y.

So, Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

OK I am satisfied that this answer is correct.

Let me double-check Zindlequack(x,z) as well.

Zindlequack(x,z) means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

We know:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary (Glimberish(x,y))
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary (Narpulate(y,z))

For Zindlequack(x,z) to be true, z must be part of x but not touch x's boundary. But we know z touches y's boundary at some point q. Since z is part of x, q is also in x. And since q is on the boundary of y and x is part of y, q is either on the boundary of x or in the interior of x.

Let's consider both cases:
1. If q is on the boundary of x, then z touches x's boundary, which contradicts Zindlequack(x,z).
2. If q is in the interior of x, then q can't be on the boundary of y, because if it were, it would be on the boundary of x (since x is part of y and touches y's boundary at q). This contradicts our premise that q is on the boundary of y.

So, Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

OK, my final answer is:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Glimberish(x,z)
6. Narpulate(x,z)
8. Frooblenap(x,z)

Hmm but wait, I want to see if there's a simpler way of arriving at this answer.

What do we know?
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary (Glimberish(x,y))
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary (Narpulate(y,z))

So both x and z are parts of y, and both touch y's boundary.

Let's consider each relationship directly:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are different parts of y, not touching each other.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior. This is possible if x and z are adjacent parts of y.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if some parts of x and z overlap within y.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is a smaller region within z that extends to the boundary of z.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible because if x touches y's boundary, and x is part of z, then z also touches y's boundary at the same points. This means x touches z's boundary, contradicting Crindlewop(x,z).

6. Narpulate(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is a smaller region within x that extends to the boundary of x.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This doesn't seem possible by similar reasoning to Crindlewop(x,z).

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are identical. This is possible if x and z are the exact same region within y.

So the possible relations are:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Glimberish(x,z)
6. Narpulate(x,z)
8. Frooblenap(x,z)

Ok, I'm satisfied that my answer is correct. Let me summarize:

Given Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Glimberish(x,z)
6. Narpulate(x,z)
8. Frooblenap(x,z)

The relations Crindlewop(x,z) and Zindlequack(x,z) are not possible.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z given:
- Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- Narpulate(y,z): z is part of y and touches y's boundary

So both x and z are parts of y, and both touch y's boundary. Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): This is possible. x and z could be disconnected parts of y, both touching y's boundary but not touching each other.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): This is possible. x and z could touch at a boundary but share no interior parts, like adjacent regions within y.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): This is possible. x and z could partially overlap within y, with neither being fully contained in the other.

4. Glimberish(x,z): This is possible. x could be part of z and touch z's boundary.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y's boundary and is part of z, then x must touch z's boundary at the point where it touches y's boundary, contradicting the definition of Crindlewop.

6. Narpulate(x,z): This is possible. z could be part of x and touch x's boundary.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): This is not possible. If z touches y's boundary and is part of x, then z must touch x's boundary at the point where it touches y's boundary, contradicting the definition of Zindlequack.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): This is possible. x and z could be coincident (the same region).

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Frooblenap(x,z)
