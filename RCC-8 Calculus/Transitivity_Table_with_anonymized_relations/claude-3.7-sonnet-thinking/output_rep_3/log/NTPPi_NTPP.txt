PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, let's analyze this problem by understanding the relations clearly:

1. **Blorpticate(x,y)**: x and y are disconnected.
2. **Snarfloon(x,y)**: x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
3. **Twizzlump(x,y)**: x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. **Glimberish(x,y)**: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. **Crindlewop(x,y)**: x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
6. **Narpulate(x,y)**: Same as Glimberish(y,x), meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. **Zindlequack(x,y)**: Same as Crindlewop(y,x), meaning y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. **Frooblenap(x,y)**: x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space).

Given that:
- Zindlequack(x,y) means y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Crindlewop(y,z) means y is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, I want to determine what relation x and z could have.

We know:
- y is a proper part of x (y is contained fully inside x, away from x's boundary).
- y is a proper part of z (y is contained fully inside z, away from z's boundary).

This means y is a common part shared by both x and z, but there are multiple ways x and z could relate to each other. Let's consider all possibilities:

1. **Blorpticate(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because they share a common part y.

2. **Snarfloon(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is not possible because they already share an interior part y.

3. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z share a spatial part (y), but neither is part of the other. This is a possibility.

4. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is a possibility. x contains y, which is a part of z, but x could also be a part of z and touch z's boundary.

5. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is a possibility. x contains y, which is a part of z, but x could also be a part of z and not touch z's boundary.

6. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is a possibility. z contains y, which is a part of x, but z could also be a part of x and touch x's boundary.

7. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is a possibility. z contains y, which is a part of x, but z could also be a part of x and not touch x's boundary.

8. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is a possibility, though it would be a special case.

Hmm, this doesn't seem right. Let me think more carefully about the constraints.

If Zindlequack(x,y), then y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is contained completely inside x.

If Crindlewop(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. y is contained completely inside z.

So, y is fully inside both x and z. Let's revisit the possibilities:

1. **Blorpticate(x,z)**: This is not possible because x and z share a common part y.

2. **Snarfloon(x,z)**: This is not possible because x and z share an interior part y.

3. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: This is possible. x and z could partially overlap, with y being in the overlap.

4. **Glimberish(x,z)**: This is possible. x could be a proper part of z, touching z's boundary, with y being a proper part of x.

5. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: This is possible. x could be a proper part of z, not touching z's boundary, with y being a proper part of x.

6. **Narpulate(x,z)**: This is possible. z could be a proper part of x, touching x's boundary, with y being a proper part of z.

7. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: This is possible. z could be a proper part of x, not touching x's boundary, with y being a proper part of z.

8. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: This is possible. x and z could be coincident, with y being a proper part of both.

Now, let's consider each case more carefully and see if any can be ruled out.

Actually, I think there are a few more constraints. If y is a proper part of both x and z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of either, then y is in the "interior" of both x and z. This means there's a non-empty intersection between the interiors of x and z. Given this, x and z must share a spatial part, ruling out Blorpticate and Snarfloon (which I already determined).

Also, if y is in the interior of both x and z, and y is a proper part of both, then neither x nor z can be a proper part of the other and also touch the other's boundary. In other words, Glimberish(x,z) and Narpulate(x,z) are not possible.

Actually wait, I'm overthinking this.

Let's simplify and visualize:

If y is a proper part of x (contained fully inside x) and y is also a proper part of z (contained fully inside z), then the possible relationships between x and z can be:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, with y in the overlap.
2. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is a proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is a proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.
4. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is a proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
5. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is a proper part of x, not touching x's boundary.
6. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident.

So, all of these are potentially valid relationships between x and z, but now I need to determine if any can be specifically ruled out based on the given conditions.

Actually wait, I need to be more precise about the terminology. In mereology and topology, when we say "part", we're referring to a general notion where one entity is contained within another, which can include proper parts (strictly contained) and the case where the entities are coincident.

Let's revisit the terms and clarify:

1. **Blorpticate(x,y)**: x and y are completely disjoint, with no overlap.
2. **Snarfloon(x,y)**: x and y share only boundaries, with no interior overlap.
3. **Twizzlump(x,y)**: x and y have a non-empty intersection, but neither is contained within the other.
4. **Glimberish(x,y)**: x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. **Crindlewop(x,y)**: x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
6. **Narpulate(x,y)**: y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. **Zindlequack(x,y)**: y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
8. **Frooblenap(x,y)**: x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space).

Given:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Crindlewop(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's consider an analogy to help visualize: Imagine x, y, and z as regions in a 2D plane. If y is inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y is also inside z (not touching z's boundary), then y is in the "interior" of both x and z. The regions x and z must overlap at least to the extent of y.

Given this, x and z cannot be Blorpticate (completely disjoint) or Snarfloon (sharing only boundaries). They must share at least the region y.

But beyond this shared region, there are several possibilities:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: This is possible. x and z could have a non-empty intersection (which includes y), but neither is contained within the other. For example, they could be two large circles that partially overlap, with y being in the overlap.

2. **Glimberish(x,z)**: This is possible. x could be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. For example, x could be a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary, with y being an even smaller circle inside x.

3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: This is possible. x could be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. For example, x could be a smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary, with y being an even smaller circle inside x.

4. **Narpulate(x,z)**: This is possible. z could be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. For example, z could be a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary, with y being an even smaller circle inside z.

5. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: This is possible. z could be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. For example, z could be a smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary, with y being an even smaller circle inside z.

6. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: This is possible. x and z could be coincident. For example, x and z could be the same circle, with y being a smaller circle inside both.

So, based on the conditions given, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)
- Frooblenap(x,z)

Actually, can I further reason about these cases? Let's think about it more deeply. If:

1. Zindlequack(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. Crindlewop(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Both of these statements tell us about the relationship between y and the boundaries of x and z. Specifically, y is away from the boundaries of both x and z. But this doesn't directly constrain the relationship between x and z beyond the fact that they must share at least the region y.

Actually, wait a moment. Let me revisit our definitions to ensure clarity:

1. **Blorpticate(x,y)**: x and y are disconnected.
2. **Snarfloon(x,y)**: x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
3. **Twizzlump(x,y)**: x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. **Glimberish(x,y)**: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. **Crindlewop(x,y)**: x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
6. **Narpulate(x,y)**: Same as Glimberish(y,x), meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. **Zindlequack(x,y)**: Same as Crindlewop(y,x), meaning y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. **Frooblenap(x,y)**: x and y are coincident.

Given:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Crindlewop(y,z): y is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Actually, I just realized a key point: "y is part of x" could mean either y is a proper part of x (y is strictly contained within x) or y is coincident with x (they occupy the same space). But the definition of Zindlequack further specifies that y doesn't touch x's boundary, which implies y is a proper part of x (not coincident). The same applies to Crindlewop.

So, the statement "y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary" indeed means y is a proper part of x and is away from x's boundary. Similarly, "y is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary" means y is a proper part of z and is away from z's boundary.

Ok, I think I'm back to where I was. Let's consider the six possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z share a spatial part (which includes y), but neither is part of the other.
2. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
4. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
5. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
6. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident.

Let's analyze each of these more meticulously.

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**:
   - x and z overlap (they share y).
   - Neither x is part of z nor z is part of x.
   - This is possible. x and z can overlap in such a way that neither is fully contained within the other.

2. **Glimberish(x,z)**:
   - x is part of z.
   - x touches z's boundary.
   - This is possible. x can be a part of z, with y being a proper part of x, and x can touch z's boundary.

3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**:
   - x is part of z.
   - x doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - This is possible. x can be a part of z, with y being a proper part of x, and x can be away from z's boundary.

4. **Narpulate(x,z)**:
   - z is part of x.
   - z touches x's boundary.
   - This is possible. z can be a part of x, with y being a proper part of z, and z can touch x's boundary.

5. **Zindlequack(x,z)**:
   - z is part of x.
   - z doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - This is possible. z can be a part of x, with y being a proper part of z, and z can be away from x's boundary.

6. **Frooblenap(x,z)**:
   - x and z are coincident.
   - This is possible. x and z can occupy the same space, with y being a proper part of both.

So, based on my analysis, all six relationships are possible: Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, and Frooblenap.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check these. I think I can be more precise, especially for Twizzlump. 

Twizzlump(x,z) means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Given the context, I know that y is a part of both x and z. But I need to ensure that neither x is part of z nor z is part of x. This is possible. I can have two overlapping regions where neither is contained within the other, and y is in the overlap.

Glimberish(x,z) means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is part of x and y is part of z, it's indeed possible for x to be a part of z. Additionally, x can touch z's boundary.

Crindlewop(x,z) means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, given that y is part of x and y is part of z, it's possible for x to be a part of z. And x can be positioned such that it doesn't touch z's boundary.

Narpulate(x,z) means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is part of z and y is part of x, it's possible for z to be a part of x. And z can touch x's boundary.

Zindlequack(x,z) means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, given that y is part of z and y is part of x, it's possible for z to be a part of x. And z can be positioned such that it doesn't touch x's boundary.

Frooblenap(x,z) means x and z are coincident. This is a valid possibility, where x and z occupy the same space, and y is a proper part of both.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this still. I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, and all of these are valid. I'm fairly confident that the answer is that all of Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z), and Frooblenap(x,z) are possible.

Let me just double-check that Blorpticate(x,z) and Snarfloon(x,z) are truly impossible.

Blorpticate(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they share a common part. Thus, Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

Snarfloon(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. We know y is part of both x and z, so they share a common part, which includes interior portions. Thus, Snarfloon(x,z) is not possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)
- Frooblenap(x,z)

Let me check this against a simpler, 2D visualization to ensure it's correct:

- Zindlequack(x,y): Imagine a large circle x with a smaller circle y inside it, not touching the boundary of x.
- Crindlewop(y,z): Imagine a large circle z with a smaller circle y inside it, not touching the boundary of z.

The constraint is that the same circle y is inside both x and z, not touching the boundaries of either. The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z overlap partially. For example, they could be two overlapping circles, with y in the overlap.
2. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is inside z and touches z's boundary. For example, x could be a circle inside z, touching z's boundary, with y inside x.
3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary. For example, x could be a circle inside z, not touching z's boundary, with y inside x.
4. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is inside x and touches x's boundary. For example, z could be a circle inside x, touching x's boundary, with y inside z.
5. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary. For example, z could be a circle inside x, not touching x's boundary, with y inside z.
6. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are the same. For example, they could be the same circle, with y inside both.

All of these are valid. So my final answer is: Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z), and Frooblenap(x,z).

Actually, wait.

We have:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Crindlewop(y,z): y is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's think of this as the following:
- Zindlequack(x,y) means y is a *proper part* of x, because it can't be coincident with x. If y were coincident with x, then y would touch the x's boundary since y and x would be the same. But Zindlequack specifically says y doesn't touch x's boundary, so y must be a proper part of x.
- Similarly, Crindlewop(y,z) means y is a *proper part* of z.

So, y is a proper part of both x and z. This means y is contained within both x and z. Given this, x and z must overlap or one must be part of the other. They can't be disconnected or just touch at boundaries.

Alright, going through the list of the 8 relations:

1. **Blorpticate(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is part of both, making them overlap.
2. **Snarfloon(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is also not possible because y is an interior part of both, so they must share some interior.
3. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z share a spatial part (which includes y), but neither is part of the other. This is definitely possible.
4. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible.
5. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible.
6. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible.
7. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible.
8. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)
- Frooblenap(x,z)

As a final check, let me consider a few concrete scenarios to ensure this is correct.

Scenario 1: Imagine y as a small circle, x as a larger circle with y inside (not touching x's boundary), and z as another larger circle with y inside (not touching z's boundary). Here, x and z could:
- Partially overlap (Twizzlump).
- x could be inside z, touching z's boundary (Glimberish).
- x could be inside z, not touching z's boundary (Crindlewop).
- z could be inside x, touching x's boundary (Narpulate).
- z could be inside x, not touching x's boundary (Zindlequack).
- x and z could be the same (Frooblenap).

All of these scenarios are geometrically possible. Thus, I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are the six I listed: Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, and Frooblenap.

Actually, let me also verify this from a set-theoretic perspective, just to be sure. 

- If Zindlequack(x,y), then y is a proper subset of x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- If Crindlewop(y,z), then y is a proper subset of z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, y is a proper subset of both x and z. This means x and z must have a non-empty intersection (at least y). Beyond this, various configurations are possible:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z overlap, but neither is a subset of the other.
2. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is a subset of z and touches the boundary of z.
3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is a subset of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
4. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is a subset of x and touches the boundary of x.
5. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is a subset of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
6. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are the same set.

All of these are theoretically possible, given the constraint that y is a proper subset of both x and z.

The only ones we can definitely rule out are:
- Blorpticate(x,z), where x and z are disjoint, because they share y.
- Snarfloon(x,z), where x and z touch only at their boundaries, because they share the interior point y.

So, based on my set-theoretic check, I again conclude that the possible relationships between x and z are: Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, and Frooblenap.

Actually, I just thought of something. The definitions provided are about "spatial parts" and not specifically about "proper parts." Let me review the definitions again to be sure:

1. **Blorpticate(x,y)**: x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. **Snarfloon(x,y)**: x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. **Twizzlump(x,y)**: x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. **Glimberish(x,y)**: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. **Crindlewop(x,y)**: x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. **Narpulate(x,y)**: y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. **Zindlequack(x,y)**: y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. **Frooblenap(x,y)**: x and y are coincident.

Given that:
- Zindlequack(x,y) means y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Crindlewop(y,z) means y is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

In Crindlewop and Zindlequack, the term "part" seems to refer to a "proper part" because if y were coincident with x or z, then the condition "doesn't touch the boundary" wouldn't make sense (as y would have the same boundary as x or z).

Yes, I'm confident now that y is a proper part of both x and z. And given this, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)
- Frooblenap(x,z)

And I've already verified from multiple angles that this is correct.

Actually, one more thought. The question asks for the possible relationships between x and z, but I've been considering if there's a transitive property, or if we can infer anything specific given the two relations.

Given:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Crindlewop(y,z): y is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

This doesn't give us much direct information about the relationship between x and z, other than the fact that they share y. This is why the range of possible relationships is broad. It's genuinely possible for x and z to have any of the six relationships I listed.

So, I'm confident in my answer: The possible relationships between x and z are Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, and Frooblenap.

Let me double-check one more time. Given our definitions:

1. **Blorpticate(x,y)**: x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. **Snarfloon(x,y)**: x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. **Twizzlump(x,y)**: x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. **Glimberish(x,y)**: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. **Crindlewop(x,y)**: x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. **Narpulate(x,y)**: y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. **Zindlequack(x,y)**: y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. **Frooblenap(x,y)**: x and y are coincident.

Blorpticate and Snarfloon are ruled out. Let's check the other 6:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z share a spatial part (which is y), but neither is part of the other. This is possible. Picture two overlapping circles with y in the overlap.

2. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. Picture x as a circle inside z, touching z's boundary, with y as a smaller circle inside x.

3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible. Picture x as a circle inside z, not touching z's boundary, with y as a smaller circle inside x.

4. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. Picture z as a circle inside x, touching x's boundary, with y as a smaller circle inside z.

5. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible. Picture z as a circle inside x, not touching x's boundary, with y as a smaller circle inside z.

6. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible. Picture x and z as the same circle, with y as a smaller circle inside.

Alright, I'm ready to finalize my answer: The possible relationships between x and z are Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, and Frooblenap.

Actually, one more quick check. Let's refer to our definitions more explicitly:

1. **Blorpticate(x,y)**: x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. **Snarfloon(x,y)**: x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. **Twizzlump(x,y)**: x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. **Glimberish(x,y)**: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. **Crindlewop(x,y)**: x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. **Narpulate(x,y)**: Same as Glimberish(y,x), meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. **Zindlequack(x,y)**: Same as Crindlewop(y,x), meaning y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. **Frooblenap(x,y)**: x and y are coincident.

I've been very careful about this, and I'm confident in the result: The possible relationships between x and z are Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, and Frooblenap.

I need to provide the final answer in the requested format, so:

### Answer: Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, Frooblenap.

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what these relations tell us:
- Zindlequack(x,y) means y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary
- Crindlewop(y,z) means y is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary

So y is a proper part of both x and z, and is fully contained within both regions without touching either boundary. This means x and z must at least share y as a common part.

Given this constraint, let me examine each possible relation:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): Impossible, as x and z share y as a common part.
2. Snarfloon(x,z): Impossible, as x and z share interior parts (specifically y).

The remaining relations are all possible:

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z can partially overlap with y in the shared region.
4. Glimberish(x,z): x can be part of z while touching z's boundary, with y inside x.
5. Crindlewop(x,z): x can be part of z without touching z's boundary, with y inside x.
6. Narpulate(x,z): z can be part of x while touching x's boundary, with y inside z.
7. Zindlequack(x,z): z can be part of x without touching x's boundary, with y inside z.
8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z can be coincident, with y inside both.

### Answer: Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, Frooblenap
