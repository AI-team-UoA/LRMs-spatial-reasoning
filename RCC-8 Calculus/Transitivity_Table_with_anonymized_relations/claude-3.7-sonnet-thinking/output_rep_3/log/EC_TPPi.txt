PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step by analyzing what we know.

1. Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
2. Narpulate(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary. (Since Narpulate(y,z) is the same as Glimberish(z,y))

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z based on these facts.

Since Snarfloon(x,y), x and y only share a boundary.
Since Narpulate(y,z), y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's consider the possible configurations:

1. If y is part of z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y at a boundary, then x might be completely outside of z, only touching z at the boundary (where x also touches y). In this case, we would have Snarfloon(x,z).

2. It's also possible that x partially overlaps with z. This would happen if some of x extends into z beyond just the boundary point where it touches y. In this case, we would have Twizzlump(x,z).

3. Another possibility is that x is completely contained within z, touching z's boundary (since it touches y, which touches z's boundary). In this case, we would have Glimberish(x,z).

4. It's also possible that x is completely contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This would be Crindlewop(x,z).

5. Could z be part of x? If y is part of z and y touches z's boundary, and x only touches y at a boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be part of x. So I don't think Narpulate(z,x) or Zindlequack(z,x) are possible.

6. Could x and z be completely disconnected? If y is part of z and y touches z's boundary, and x touches y at a boundary, then x must at least touch z at the boundary. So Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

7. Could x and z be coincident? Since y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, x and z cannot be coincident. So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me re-examine possibility 4. If x is completely contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is only related to interior points of z. But we know that x touches y at a boundary, and y touches z's boundary. So x must also touch z's boundary. Therefore, Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

Also, let me reconsider possibility 3. For Glimberish(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary. But given that x only touches y at a boundary, and y is part of z and touches z's boundary, it's not clear that x must be entirely contained within z. It could just touch z at the boundary without being contained in it, which would be Snarfloon(x,z).

Let me revise my thinking:

1. Snarfloon(x,z): Possible. x can touch z at exactly the same boundary point where it touches y, without sharing any interior with z.

2. Twizzlump(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z, sharing some interior parts with z, but neither is contained in the other.

3. Glimberish(x,z): Possible, but I need to think about this more carefully. For this to be true, x must be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary.

4. Crindlewop(x,z): Not possible for the reason explained above.

5. Narpulate(z,x): Not possible because y is part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so z cannot be part of x.

6. Zindlequack(z,x): Not possible for the same reason as 5.

7. Blorpticate(x,z): Not possible because x touches y, which is part of z, so x at least touches z.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): Not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so x and z cannot be coincident.

Let me re-examine possibility 3 (Glimberish(x,z)) more carefully. We know:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

For Glimberish(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y at a boundary, and y touches z's boundary, it's possible that x is contained within z and touches z's boundary at the same point where it touches y. So Glimberish(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let's visualize these relationships to ensure I'm not missing anything:

For Snarfloon(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z
- y touches the boundary of z
- x touches y only at y's boundary
- x does not share any interior parts with y

Given these constraints, there are a few possible configurations for x relative to z:

1. x could be outside of z, touching z only at the boundary point where it also touches y. This would be Snarfloon(x,z).

2. x could partially overlap with z, sharing some interior parts with z but not being contained within z. This would be Twizzlump(x,z).

3. x could be a proper part of z, touching z's boundary (at the point where it touches y). This would be Glimberish(x,z).

I think these are all the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints. So the answer is:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), or Glimberish(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check if Blorpticate(x,z) is really impossible. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, then x must also touch z at z's boundary. Therefore, x and z cannot be disconnected, so Blorpticate(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Let me also double-check if Crindlewop(x,z) is really impossible. For Crindlewop(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. But since x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, x must also touch z at z's boundary. Therefore, Crindlewop(x,z) is indeed impossible.

I'm confident in my final answer:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), or Glimberish(x,z).

Hmm actually, let me think one more time about these possibilities:

1. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if x is outside of z but touches z at the boundary point where it also touches y.

2. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z.

3. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at the point where it also touches y.

There's one more case I haven't considered: what if x is entirely within z but doesn't touch z's boundary? This would be Crindlewop(x,z). But given that x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, x must also touch z at z's boundary. So Crindlewop(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Just because y touches z's boundary doesn't mean that every part of y's boundary is also part of z's boundary. y could touch z's boundary at some points, but other parts of y's boundary could be in the interior of z.

So if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z, then x could be entirely within z and not touch z's boundary. This would make Crindlewop(x,z) possible.

Let me revise:

1. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if x is outside of z but touches z at the boundary point where it also touches y.

2. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z.

3. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at the point where it also touches y.

4. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z.

Wait, I need to re-read the definitions carefully. The definition of Narpulate(y,z) states that y is part of z and touches z's boundary. It doesn't state that every part of y's boundary is also part of z's boundary. So Narpulate(y,z) is compatible with y having boundary parts in the interior of z as well.

So if x touches y at a boundary part of y that's in the interior of z, then x could be entirely within z and not touch z's boundary. This would make Crindlewop(x,z) possible.

So I think the possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to be even more careful and reconsider each possibility from scratch:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This is not possible because if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is part of z, then x must also touch or overlap with z.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if x is outside of z but touches z at a boundary point.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. Narpulate(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because y is part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so z cannot be part of x.

7. Zindlequack(z,x): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as 6.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so x and z cannot be coincident.

Actually, let me reconsider Crindlewop(x,z) again. For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y at y's boundary, and y is part of z, x could be a proper part of z if it touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z. So Crindlewop(x,z) is possible.

OK, let me try yet again.

We know that:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We can infer:
- x touches y only at y's boundary.
- x and y don't share any interior parts.
- y is a proper part of z.
- y touches z's boundary.

The question is: what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's go through the options one by one:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This is not possible because x touches y, which is part of z, so x must at least touch z.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if x is outside of z but touches z at the boundary point where it also touches y.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z beyond the boundary point where it touches y.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at the point where it also touches y.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z.

6. Narpulate(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because y is part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so z cannot be part of x.

7. Zindlequack(z,x): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as 6.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so x and z cannot be coincident.

Actually, let me reconsider possibility 5 (Crindlewop(x,z)) more carefully. For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, if x is entirely contained within z, it would likely touch z's boundary at the same point where it touches y. But it's also possible that x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z. In this case, x would be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary, making Crindlewop(x,z) possible.

Actually, let me be super clear about the possible configurations:

1. If x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's also part of z's boundary, then x touches both y and z at that boundary point. Depending on how much of x is within z, we could have:
   - Snarfloon(x,z): if x is entirely outside z except for the boundary point.
   - Twizzlump(x,z): if x partially overlaps with z.
   - Glimberish(x,z): if x is entirely contained within z.

2. If x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's in the interior of z, then x doesn't touch z's boundary. Depending on how much of x is within z, we could have:
   - Twizzlump(x,z): if x partially overlaps with z.
   - Crindlewop(x,z): if x is entirely contained within z.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Actually, let me re-examine all of these options again:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This is not possible because x touches y, which is part of z, so x must at least touch z.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if x is outside of z but touches z at the boundary point where it also touches y.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z and part of x extends outside of z.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z.

6. Narpulate(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because y is part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so z cannot be part of x. Actually, wait—maybe this is wrong? Let me think about this more carefully. If z is part of x, and y is part of z, then y is part of x. But we're given that Snarfloon(x,y), which means x and y don't share any interior parts. So this reinforces that z cannot be part of x, and Narpulate(z,x) is indeed not possible.

7. Zindlequack(z,x): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as 6.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so x and z cannot be coincident.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me reconsider option 6 yet again. 

Narpulate(z,x) means that z is part of x and touches x's boundary.

Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

If z were part of x, then since y is part of z, y would also be part of x. But we're given that Snarfloon(x,y), which means x and y don't share any interior parts. This contradiction confirms that z cannot be part of x, so Narpulate(z,x) is indeed not possible.

OK, now I'm confident:

The possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Actually, let me take yet another approach. Let's visualize specific examples to ensure I've considered all possibilities:

1. Example for Snarfloon(x,z):
   z is a circle.
   y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point.
   x is a circle outside of z, touching y (and hence z) at that one point.
   In this case, x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts, so Snarfloon(x,z) holds.

2. Example for Twizzlump(x,z):
   z is a circle.
   y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point.
   x is a circle that partially overlaps with z, touching y at that one point.
   In this case, x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other, so Twizzlump(x,z) holds.

3. Example for Glimberish(x,z):
   z is a circle.
   y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point.
   x is a circle entirely contained within z, touching y (and hence z) at that one boundary point.
   In this case, x is part of z and touches z's boundary, so Glimberish(x,z) holds.

4. Example for Crindlewop(x,z):
   z is a circle.
   y is a smaller circle inside z, with part of y's boundary in the interior of z.
   x is a circle entirely contained within z, touching y at a part of y's boundary that's in the interior of z.
   In this case, x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary, so Crindlewop(x,z) holds.

I think I've now considered all the possible configurations. So the possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Hmm, now I think I need to reconsider if Crindlewop(x,z) is really possible. Let's be careful: 

Crindlewop(x,z) means that x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Narpulate(y,z) says that y is part of z and touches z's boundary. This means that some part of y's boundary coincides with z's boundary.

Now, Snarfloon(x,y) says that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This means that x touches y at some point on y's boundary.

If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that also lies on z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, so Crindlewop(x,z) would not be possible.

If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z, then x would not touch z's boundary, and Crindlewop(x,z) would be possible (assuming x is entirely contained within z).

So, Crindlewop(x,z) is possible if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z, and x is entirely contained within z.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Let me review one more time to make sure I haven't made any mistakes:

Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Possible relationships between x and z:

1. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if x is outside of z but touches z at the boundary point where it also touches y.

2. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z and part of x extends outside of z.

3. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at the point where it also touches y.

4. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z.

5. Narpulate(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because if z were part of x, then y would also be part of x (since y is part of z), which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y).

6. Zindlequack(z,x): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as 5.

7. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This is not possible because x touches y, which is part of z, so x must at least touch z.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so x and z cannot be coincident.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

I'm now confident that this is the correct answer.

Wait, I need to reconsider. Let's analyze the problem from a different angle.

We are told:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's think about what these relations tell us:
1. Snarfloon(x,y) means x and y only share a boundary point; they don't overlap.
2. Narpulate(y,z) means y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

If x touches y only at a boundary point, and y is contained within z and touches z's boundary, then there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary. The relationship between x and z can be:
   - Snarfloon(x,z) if x is outside of z and only touches z at that boundary point.
   - Twizzlump(x,z) if x partially overlaps with z.
   - Glimberish(x,z) if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at that point.

2. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z, then x does not touch z's boundary. The relationship between x and z can be:
   - Twizzlump(x,z) if x partially overlaps with z.
   - Crindlewop(x,z) if x is entirely contained within z.

Combining these, the possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

This matches my previous analysis, so I'm now more confident in this answer.

Actually, let me come up with visual examples for clarity:

1. For Snarfloon(x,z):
   Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point, and x as a circle outside of z that touches y (and hence z) at that same boundary point. Here, x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

2. For Twizzlump(x,z):
   There are two subcases:
   a. Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point, and x as a circle that partially overlaps with z and touches y at that same boundary point. Here, x and z share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other.
   b. Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle that partially overlaps with z and touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z. Again, x and z share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other.

3. For Glimberish(x,z):
   Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point, and x as a circle entirely contained within z that touches y (and hence z) at that same boundary point. Here, x is part of z and touches z's boundary.

4. For Crindlewop(x,z):
   Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a circle entirely contained within z that touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z. Here, x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

I believe the answer is still the same as before: the possible relationships between x and z are Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z). But wait, let me be super careful with case 4...

In case 4, y is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But this contradicts Narpulate(y,z), which states that y is part of z and touches z's boundary. So case 4 is not possible under the given constraints.

Actually, wait, I misunderstood. Narpulate(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary. This means that y is entirely contained within z and at least one point of y touches the boundary of z. It doesn't mean that every point of y's boundary is on z's boundary.

So for case 4, y can be a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at some points, but not at others. Then, x can touch y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z. In this case, x would be entirely contained within z and not touch z's boundary, making Crindlewop(x,z) possible.

Okay, I think the answer is still: 
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Wait, I'm forgetting to answer the actual question, which was asking about the relationship between x and z. Let me do that now:

Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

So the answer is: Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Wait, let me make sure that I didn't miss any possibilities...

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This is not possible because x touches y, which is part of z, so x must at least touch z.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if x is outside of z but touches z at the boundary point where it also touches y.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z and part of x extends outside of z.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at the point where it also touches y.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z and touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z.

6. Narpulate(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because if z were part of x, then y would also be part of x (since y is part of z), which contradicts Snarfloon(x,y).

7. Zindlequack(z,x): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as 6.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at a boundary, so x and z cannot be coincident.

OK, so still: Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider case 5 one more time with a specific example. I think I might have misunderstood the definitions.

Crindlewop(x,z) means that x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

If x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, it's possible that x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z. In this case, x would be entirely contained within z and not touch z's boundary, making Crindlewop(x,z) possible.

So I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what each relation means and determine the possible configurations between x and z.

Given:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- Narpulate(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Let me consider the possible spatial configurations:

1. If x touches y at a point where y also touches z's boundary:
   - x could be outside z, only touching z at that boundary point → Snarfloon(x,z)
   - x could partially overlap with z (part inside, part outside) → Twizzlump(x,z)
   - x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary at that point → Glimberish(x,z)

2. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of z:
   - x could partially overlap with z → Twizzlump(x,z)
   - x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary → Crindlewop(x,z)

All other relations are impossible because:
- x must at least touch z (via y), so they can't be disconnected
- z cannot be part of x because y is part of z but doesn't share interior with x
- x and z cannot be coincident because y is a proper part of z

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z)
