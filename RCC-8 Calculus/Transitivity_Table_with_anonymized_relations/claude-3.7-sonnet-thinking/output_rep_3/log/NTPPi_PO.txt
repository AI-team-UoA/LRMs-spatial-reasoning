PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's review the spatial relations:

1. Blorpticate(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. Twizzlump(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. Crindlewop(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. Narpulate(x,y): same as Glimberish(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. Zindlequack(x,y): same as Crindlewop(y,x), so y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. Frooblenap(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z, given:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- Twizzlump(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. Since y is part of x (from Zindlequack(x,y)), y is completely contained within x's interior.
2. Since y and z share a spatial part (from Twizzlump(y,z)), there's an overlap between y and z.
3. Since y is completely within x, this overlap between y and z must also be within x.
4. This means that x and z must share at least some spatial part (the part they both share with y).

So, x and z must share some spatial part. This rules out:
- Blorpticate(x,z): They can't be disconnected.
- Snarfloon(x,z): They can't just touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts.

Now, let's consider the remaining relations:

- Twizzlump(x,z): This is possible if x and z share a part (which we've established), and neither is completely contained within the other.
- Glimberish(x,z): This would mean z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z extends from y to x's boundary.
- Crindlewop(x,z): This would mean z is completely contained within x's interior. This is possible if z is contained within x.
- Narpulate(x,z): This would mean x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This seems unlikely given that y is part of x and overlaps with z, but it's not immediately ruled out.
- Zindlequack(x,z): This would mean z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is contained within x's interior.
- Frooblenap(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. This seems unlikely given the constraints, but let's check.

Let's think more about each of these potential relations:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: For this to be true, x and z must share a part, and neither is completely contained within the other. We've established they share a part (through y). For neither to be part of the other, z must extend outside of x in some way. This is possible, so Twizzlump(x,z) is a potential relation.

2. **Glimberish(x,z)**: This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. For z to be part of x, it must be completely contained within x. Additionally, for z to touch x's boundary, it must extend to the boundary. This is possible, so Glimberish(x,z) is a potential relation.

3. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to be part of x, it must be completely contained within x. Additionally, for z not to touch x's boundary, it must be fully within x's interior. This is possible, so Crindlewop(x,z) is a potential relation.

4. **Narpulate(x,z)**: This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For x to be part of z, z must completely contain x. But we've established that y is part of x and overlaps with z. For both of these to be true, z would have to contain x, which means z would contain y. But this contradicts Twizzlump(y,z), which says neither y nor z is part of the other. So, Narpulate(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: This means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is actually the same as Crindlewop(x,z), which we've already identified as a potential relation.

6. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: This means x and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space). But we've established that y is part of x and overlaps with z. If x and z were coincident, then z would contain y, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Frooblenap(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Wait, I made a mistake in my analysis of Zindlequack and Crindlewop. Let me clarify:

- Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
- Zindlequack(x,z): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

So, these are different relations. Let's re-analyze:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: For this to be true, x and z must share a part, and neither is completely contained within the other. We've established they share a part (through y). For neither to be part of the other, z must extend outside of x in some way. This is possible, so Twizzlump(x,z) is a potential relation.

2. **Glimberish(x,z)**: This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For x to be part of z, it must be completely contained within z. But we've established that y is part of x and overlaps with z. If x is part of z, then y would also be part of z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Glimberish(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Wait, I'm not being precise in my reasoning. Let me take a step back and be more careful.

Given:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Twizzlump(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, and neither is completely part of the other.

The fact that y is part of x means that any part of y is also a part of x. Since y and z share a spatial part, that shared part is also a part of x. This means x and z also share a spatial part.

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

1. **Blorpticate(x,z)**: This would mean x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. But we've established that they share a part (through y), so Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

2. **Snarfloon(x,z)**: This would mean x and z touch only at a boundary without sharing any interior parts. But we've established that they share an interior part (through y), so Snarfloon(x,z) is not possible.

3. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: This would mean x and z share a spatial part, and neither is completely part of the other. We've established they share a part. For neither to be part of the other, z must have parts outside of x, and x must have parts outside of z. Given the constraints, this is a possible relation.

4. **Glimberish(x,z)**: This would mean x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z. But if all of x is within z, then all of y (which is part of x) would also be within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Glimberish(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: This would mean x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, for x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z. But if all of x is within z, then all of y (which is part of x) would also be within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Crindlewop(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. **Narpulate(x,z)**: This would mean z is part of x and touches x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. Given the constraints, this is a possible relation. But for z to touch x's boundary, z must extend to x's boundary. Is this possible given that y is part of x, doesn't touch x's boundary, and overlaps with z?

Let's think about this. If z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, and z overlaps with y, and y is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z must extend from y to x's boundary. This is indeed possible. So, Narpulate(x,z) is a potential relation.

7. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: This would mean z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. Given the constraints, this is a possible relation. For z not to touch x's boundary, z must be fully within x's interior. Given that y is part of x, doesn't touch x's boundary, and overlaps with z, it's possible for z to be entirely within x's interior without touching its boundary. So, Zindlequack(x,z) is a potential relation.

8. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: This would mean x and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space). If x and z are coincident, then z contains all of y (since y is part of x). But this contradicts Twizzlump(y,z), which says neither y nor z is part of the other. So, Frooblenap(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)

Wait, I'm still not thinking this through clearly. Let me reconsider.

Given:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Twizzlump(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, and neither is completely part of the other.

I need to be more precise about what "part of" and "share a part" mean.

If y is "part of" x, it means that all of y is contained within x. If y and z "share a part", it means there's a region that belongs to both y and z.

Now, the possible relations between x and z:

1. **Blorpticate(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. But since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share at least that part. So, Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

2. **Snarfloon(x,z)**: x and z touch only at a boundary. But again, since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share an interior part. So, Snarfloon(x,z) is not possible.

3. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z share a part, and neither is completely part of the other. We've established they share a part. For z not to be part of x, z must have parts outside of x. This is consistent with the given constraints. For x not to be part of z, x must have parts outside of z. Given that y is entirely contained within x and not entirely contained within z, x must have parts outside of z. So, Twizzlump(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z. But this would mean y is also entirely contained within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Glimberish(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, for x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z, which would mean y is also entirely contained within z, contradicting Twizzlump(y,z). So, Crindlewop(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is part of x and touches x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible given the constraints. For z to touch x's boundary, z must extend to x's boundary. Given that z overlaps with y and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z must have parts outside of y that extend to x's boundary. This is possible. So, Narpulate(x,z) is a potential relation.

7. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible. For z not to touch x's boundary, z must be fully within x's interior. Given the constraints, this is also possible. So, Zindlequack(x,z) is a potential relation.

8. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z occupy exactly the same space. But if y is part of x and not part of z (from Twizzlump(y,z)), then x and z cannot be coincident. So, Frooblenap(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)

Actually, I need to be even more precise. 

Twizzlump(y,z) means y and z share a part, and neither is completely part of the other. This doesn't mean y and z can't overlap significantly; it just means neither is completely contained within the other.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. **Blorpticate(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. But since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share at least that part. So, Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

2. **Snarfloon(x,z)**: x and z touch only at a boundary. But since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share an interior part. So, Snarfloon(x,z) is not possible.

3. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z share a part, and neither is completely part of the other. We've established they share a part (through y). For z not to be part of x, z must have parts outside of x. This is consistent with the given constraints. For x not to be part of z, x must have parts outside of z. Given the constraints, this is possible. So, Twizzlump(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z. This would mean y is also entirely contained within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Glimberish(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, for x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z, which would mean y is also entirely contained within z, contradicting Twizzlump(y,z). So, Crindlewop(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is part of x and touches x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible. For z to touch x's boundary, z must extend to x's boundary. Given that z overlaps with y and y doesn't touch x's boundary (from Zindlequack(x,y)), z must have parts outside of y that extend to x's boundary. This is possible. So, Narpulate(x,z) is a potential relation.

7. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible. For z not to touch x's boundary, z must be fully within x's interior. Given the constraints, this is also possible. So, Zindlequack(x,z) is a potential relation.

8. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z occupy exactly the same space. But if y is part of x and not part of z (from Twizzlump(y,z)), then x and z cannot be coincident. So, Frooblenap(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)

I'm a bit uncertain about Narpulate(x,z). Let me think about it again.

Narpulate(x,z) means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible given the constraints. For z to touch x's boundary, z must extend to x's boundary. 

Given that z overlaps with y (from Twizzlump(y,z)) and y doesn't touch x's boundary (from Zindlequack(x,y)), z must have parts outside of y that extend to x's boundary. Is this possible?

Yes, it is. Since y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is within x's interior. z can overlap with y and also extend to x's boundary, as long as z is entirely contained within x. This doesn't contradict any of the given constraints. So, Narpulate(x,z) is a potential relation.

Let me check Zindlequack(x,z) once more.

Zindlequack(x,z) means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible. For z not to touch x's boundary, z must be fully within x's interior. Given that z overlaps with y and y is within x's interior, this is also possible. So, Zindlequack(x,z) is a potential relation.

I'm confident in my conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)

But wait a second... I think I'm using the incorrect definition of Narpulate. Let me double check.

Narpulate(x,z) is the same as Glimberish(z,x). Glimberish(z,x) means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. So Narpulate(x,z) means x is part of z and touches z's boundary.

So Narpulate(x,z) means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z. But if all of x is within z, then all of y (which is part of x) would also be within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Narpulate(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let me check Zindlequack again as well.

Zindlequack(x,z) is the same as Crindlewop(z,x). Crindlewop(z,x) means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So Zindlequack(x,z) means x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So Zindlequack(x,z) means x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z. But if all of x is within z, then all of y (which is part of x) would also be within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Zindlequack(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Now I need to check:
- Narpulate(z,x)
- Zindlequack(z,x)

Narpulate(z,x) is the same as Glimberish(x,z). So Narpulate(z,x) means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible given the constraints. For z to touch x's boundary, z must extend to x's boundary. Given that z overlaps with y and y doesn't touch x's boundary (from Zindlequack(x,y)), z must have parts outside of y that extend to x's boundary. This is possible. So, Narpulate(z,x) is a potential relation.

Zindlequack(z,x) is the same as Crindlewop(x,z). So Zindlequack(z,x) means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible. For z not to touch x's boundary, z must be fully within x's interior. Given that z overlaps with y and y is within x's interior, this is also possible. So, Zindlequack(z,x) is a potential relation.

Wait, I think I might be confusing myself. Let me go back to the original definitions:

Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
Narpulate(x,y) is the same as Glimberish(y,x): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

So Narpulate(x,z) means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.

Crindlewop(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
Zindlequack(x,y) is the same as Crindlewop(y,x): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

So Zindlequack(x,z) means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given these clarifications, let's reassess the possible relations between x and z:

1. **Blorpticate(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. But since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share at least that part. So, Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

2. **Snarfloon(x,z)**: x and z touch only at a boundary. But since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share an interior part. So, Snarfloon(x,z) is not possible.

3. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z share a part, and neither is completely part of the other. We've established they share a part (through y). For z not to be part of x, z must have parts outside of x. This is possible. For x not to be part of z, x must have parts outside of z. Given that y is entirely contained within x and not entirely contained within z, x must have parts outside of z. So, Twizzlump(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z. But this would mean y is also entirely contained within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Glimberish(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, for x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z, which would mean y is also entirely contained within z, contradicting Twizzlump(y,z). So, Crindlewop(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is part of x and touches x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible. For z to touch x's boundary, z must extend to x's boundary. Given that z overlaps with y and y doesn't touch x's boundary (from Zindlequack(x,y)), z must have parts outside of y that extend to x's boundary. This is possible. So, Narpulate(x,z) is a potential relation.

7. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible. For z not to touch x's boundary, z must be fully within x's interior. Given that z overlaps with y and y is within x's interior, this is also possible. So, Zindlequack(x,z) is a potential relation.

8. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z occupy exactly the same space. But if y is part of x and not part of z (from Twizzlump(y,z)), then x and z cannot be coincident. So, Frooblenap(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)

Now, let me reason through this again to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Given:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Twizzlump(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, and neither is completely part of the other.

Now, the possible relations between x and z:

1. **Blorpticate(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. Since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share at least that part. So, Blorpticate(x,z) is not possible.

2. **Snarfloon(x,z)**: x and z touch only at a boundary. Since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share an interior part. So, Snarfloon(x,z) is not possible.

3. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: x and z share a part (through y), and neither is completely part of the other. For z not to be part of x, z must have parts outside of x. This is possible (and consistent with Twizzlump(y,z)). For x not to be part of z, x must have parts outside of z. This is also possible (and consistent with the fact that y is entirely contained within x and not entirely contained within z). So, Twizzlump(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. **Glimberish(x,z)**: x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z. But this would mean y is also entirely contained within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(y,z). So, Glimberish(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. **Crindlewop(x,z)**: x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, for x to be part of z, all of x must be contained within z, which would mean y is also entirely contained within z, contradicting Twizzlump(y,z). So, Crindlewop(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. **Narpulate(x,z)**: z is part of x and touches x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible (though it means z doesn't have parts outside of x, which is a specific case). For z to touch x's boundary, z must extend to x's boundary. This is also possible. So, Narpulate(x,z) is a potential relation.

7. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For z to be part of x, all of z must be contained within x. This is possible (again, a specific case). For z not to touch x's boundary, z must be fully within x's interior. This is also possible. So, Zindlequack(x,z) is a potential relation.

8. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z occupy exactly the same space. But if y is part of x and not part of z (from Twizzlump(y,z)), then x and z cannot be coincident. So, Frooblenap(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)

Wait, I want to be super precise about the definitions of these relations. Let me re-read the prompt to make sure I understand.

Blorpticate(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
Twizzlump(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
Glimberish(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
Crindlewop(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
Narpulate(x,y) is the same as Glimberish(y,x), so Narpulate(x,y) means y is part of x and y touches x's boundary.
Zindlequack(x,y) is the same as Crindlewop(y,x), so Zindlequack(x,y) means y is part of x and y does not touch x's boundary.
Frooblenap(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

These are what I've been using. Let's continue.

Given:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Twizzlump(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Let's think about this problem from a slightly different angle, focusing on whether z can be part of x or not.

1. If z is part of x, then z is entirely contained within x. Given that y and z share a part (from Twizzlump(y,z)), this means that their shared part is within x.

2. The question is: can z touch x's boundary? If z is part of x and touches x's boundary, then Narpulate(x,z) is true. If z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary, then Zindlequack(x,z) is true.

3. There's nothing in the given information that would prevent z from touching x's boundary or from not touching it. So both Narpulate(x,z) and Zindlequack(x,z) are possible.

4. What if z is not entirely contained within x? In that case, z has parts outside of x. But given that y and z share a part (from Twizzlump(y,z)) and y is entirely within x (from Zindlequack(x,y)), x and z must share at least the part that y and z share. If x and z share a part, and neither is part of the other, then Twizzlump(x,z) is true.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)

Let me be absolutely sure with specific examples, drawing on a 2D plane:

1. **Twizzlump(x,z)**: Imagine x is a large circle, y is a small circle entirely within x and not touching x's boundary. z is a circle that overlaps with y, but z extends beyond x's boundary. In this scenario, x and z share a part (the part they both share with y), but neither is part of the other (z extends outside of x, and x has parts outside of z).

2. **Narpulate(x,z)**: Imagine x is a large circle, y is a small circle entirely within x and not touching x's boundary. z is a circle that overlaps with y and also touches x's boundary, but z is entirely contained within x. In this scenario, z is part of x and touches x's boundary.

3. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: Imagine x is a large circle, y is a small circle entirely within x and not touching x's boundary. z is a circle that overlaps with y, but z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. In this scenario, z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

All three of these scenarios are consistent with the given constraints, confirming that Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), and Zindlequack(x,z) are all possible relations between x and z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z based on the given conditions.

Given information:
- Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- Twizzlump(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other

Analysis:
1) Since y is part of x, and y shares a spatial part with z, then x and z must share at least that same spatial part (the part that y and z share).

2) This immediately rules out:
   - Blorpticate(x,z): impossible because they share spatial parts
   - Snarfloon(x,z): impossible because they share interior parts, not just boundary contact

3) For the remaining possibilities:
   - Twizzlump(x,z): Possible. x and z share the part that y and z share, but z can extend outside x, and x contains parts (like portions of y) that z doesn't contain.
   
   - Narpulate(x,z): Possible. z could be entirely within x and touch x's boundary while still sharing parts with y.
   
   - Zindlequack(x,z): Possible. z could be entirely within x without touching x's boundary while still overlapping with y.

4) The following are impossible:
   - Glimberish(x,z) and Crindlewop(x,z): Impossible because these would require x to be part of z, but this would mean y is also part of z (contradicting Twizzlump(y,z))
   - Frooblenap(x,z): Impossible because x and z cannot be coincident since y is part of x but not part of z
