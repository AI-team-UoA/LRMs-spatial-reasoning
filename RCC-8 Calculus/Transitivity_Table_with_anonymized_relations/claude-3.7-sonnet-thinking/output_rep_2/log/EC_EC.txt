PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to analyze the possible relationships between x and z given that Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z).

First, let me recall what Snarfloon means:
Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

So we know that:
- x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts

Now, let's consider what this means for the relationship between x and z. There are several possibilities:

1. x and z could be completely disconnected, which would be Blorpticate(x,z)
2. x and z could touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts, which would be Snarfloon(x,z)
3. x and z could overlap partially, sharing some interior parts but neither is contained in the other, which would be Twizzlump(x,z)
4. x could be a proper part of z touching z's boundary, which would be Glimberish(x,z)
5. x could be a proper part of z not touching z's boundary, which would be Crindlewop(x,z)
6. z could be a proper part of x touching x's boundary, which would be Narpulate(x,z)
7. z could be a proper part of x not touching x's boundary, which would be Zindlequack(x,z)
8. x and z could be coincident, which would be Frooblenap(x,z)

Let's analyze which of these are possible given the constraints.

Since Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), we know that x, y, and z all touch at boundaries.

Let me visualize some possible scenarios:

Case 1: x and z are on opposite sides of y
```
  x | y | z
```
In this case, x and z are disconnected, so Blorpticate(x,z) would hold.

Case 2: x and z touch y at the same point or region
```
    x
     \
      *
     /
    z
```
where * is a boundary point of y. In this case, x and z might touch at that point as well, so Snarfloon(x,z) could hold.

Case 3: x and z overlap in some region that doesn't include y
```
  x---\
       \
        \
    y----*----z
```
where x and z overlap in some region separate from y. In this case, Twizzlump(x,z) would hold.

Cases 4-7: I don't think proper part relationships are possible here, because if x is a proper part of z (or vice versa), and both touch y at boundaries, then y would have to be either inside both x and z, or partially inside one and touching the boundary of the other. But both of those contradict the fact that y doesn't share interior parts with either x or z.

Case 8: x and z could be coincident only if they're both coincident with y, which would contradict Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z). So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my analysis:

For Blorpticate(x,z), we need x and z to be disconnected. This is possible if x and y touch at one boundary point/region, and y and z touch at a different boundary point/region.

For Snarfloon(x,z), we need x and z to touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts. This is possible if x and y touch at a boundary point/region, y and z touch at the same or a different boundary point/region, and x and z happen to touch at a boundary as well.

For Twizzlump(x,z), we need x and z to share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if x and z overlap in a region separate from y.

For Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z), we would need x to be a proper part of z. But if x touches y at a boundary, and y doesn't share interior parts with z, then x can't be inside z. So these are not possible.

Similarly, for Narpulate(x,z) or Zindlequack(x,z), we would need z to be a proper part of x, which isn't possible for the same reason.

For Frooblenap(x,z), we would need x and z to be coincident, which would mean they share all parts. But then both would have the same relationship with y, contradicting the premise.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Blorpticate(x,z)
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)

Actually, I need to check my reasoning for Twizzlump(x,z). I said it's possible if x and z overlap in a region separate from y. But is that consistent with Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z)?

If x and z share interior parts (Twizzlump), then there's a region that's both inside x and inside z. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), this shared region must be separate from y. But that means y must touch both x and z at their boundaries, without entering the region where they overlap.

Let me visualize this:
```
    x-------
    |       \
    |        \
    |         \
y---*----------*---
    |          |
    |          |
    |          |
    ------------
         z
```
where the region enclosed by the lines is the interior of x and z, and the *s are boundary points where y touches x and z.

Actually, I'm not sure this is a valid configuration. Let's revisit the definition of Snarfloon.

Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

If x and z overlap (Twizzlump), and both touch y at boundaries (Snarfloon), can y avoid entering the region where x and z overlap? I'm not convinced this is always possible in 2D or 3D space.

Let me try a different approach. Let's define regions more precisely:

- Let X be the region occupied by x
- Let Y be the region occupied by y
- Let Z be the region occupied by z

We know that:
- X and Y touch at boundaries but don't share interior: Snarfloon(x,y)
- Y and Z touch at boundaries but don't share interior: Snarfloon(y,z)

We're trying to determine the possible relationships between X and Z.

If X and Z are completely disconnected, that's Blorpticate(x,z).

If X and Z touch at a boundary without sharing interior, that's Snarfloon(x,z).

But can X and Z share interior parts (Twizzlump)? If they do, and both touch Y at boundaries without sharing interior with Y, then Y must somehow touch the boundaries of both X and Z without entering the region where they overlap. This seems geometrically possible, e.g., Y could be a line segment touching the boundaries of X and Z at different points.

So Twizzlump(x,z) does seem possible.

What about the proper part relationships? Could x be a proper part of z or vice versa?

If x is a proper part of z (Glimberish or Crindlewop), then all of x is inside z. But x touches y at a boundary, and y doesn't share interior with z. This means y must touch z at exactly the same boundary point where it touches x. Is this possible? It might be in some configurations, e.g., if y is a point touching the boundary of z, and x is a small region inside z that extends to touch y at the same point.

Similarly, if z is a proper part of x (Narpulate or Zindlequack), then all of z is inside x. But z touches y at a boundary, and y doesn't share interior with x. This is analogous to the previous case.

So it seems the proper part relationships might be possible after all. Let me reconsider.

Actually, I think there's a conceptual issue here. The definition of Snarfloon(x,y) says that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This means there's at least one point that's on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y, but no point that's in the interior of both x and y.

Now, if x is a proper part of z (Glimberish or Crindlewop), then all points of x are points of z. So if x touches y at a boundary, then z also touches y at that same boundary. But Snarfloon(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior. 

This is getting a bit abstract, so let me try with a concrete example. Suppose we have:
- x is a small circle
- y is a point on the boundary of x
- z is a large circle containing x, and y is also on the boundary of z

In this case, we have Snarfloon(x,y) because x and y touch at a boundary (y is a point on the boundary of x) without sharing interior (since y is just a point, it has no interior). We also have Snarfloon(y,z) for the same reason.

And here, x is a proper part of z, touching z's boundary at the point y. So we have Glimberish(x,z).

So it seems Glimberish(x,z) is possible.

By symmetry, Narpulate(x,z) should also be possible.

What about Crindlewop(x,z) and Zindlequack(x,z)? These would require x to be a proper part of z without touching z's boundary, or vice versa. But if x touches y at a boundary, and y touches z at a boundary, how can x be inside z without touching z's boundary?

Actually, I think it's possible if y is not a point but a more complex shape. For example:
- x is a small circle inside z but not touching z's boundary
- y is a line segment that extends from the boundary of x to the boundary of z
- z is a large circle containing x

In this case, we have Snarfloon(x,y) because x and y touch at a boundary without sharing interior. We also have Snarfloon(y,z) for the same reason. And x is a proper part of z not touching z's boundary, so we have Crindlewop(x,z).

So Crindlewop(x,z) is also possible, and by symmetry, Zindlequack(x,z) should be possible too.

Finally, could x and z be coincident (Frooblenap)? If they are, then they have the same relationship with y. But we know Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), so this is consistent. So Frooblenap(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I made a mistake. If x and z are coincident, then Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) are saying the same thing. But that doesn't contradict the premise. So Frooblenap(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me revise my answer. The possible relationships between x and z given Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) are:
- Blorpticate(x,z)
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)
- Frooblenap(x,z)

Wait, that's all of them! Let me reconsider whether each is truly possible.

For Blorpticate(x,z), we need x and z to be disconnected. This is possible if x touches y at one point, and z touches y at another point, with y acting as a separator.

For Snarfloon(x,z), we need x and z to touch at a boundary without sharing interior. This is possible if x, y, and z all touch at a common boundary point.

For Twizzlump(x,z), we need x and z to share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. I'm actually not sure this is possible given Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z). If x and z overlap, and both touch y at boundaries without sharing interior with y, can y avoid entering the region where x and z overlap? Let me think about this more.

Actually, I think Twizzlump(x,z) is possible. Imagine x and z as overlapping circles, and y as a line segment touching both circles at their boundaries without entering the region where they overlap.

For Glimberish(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z touching z's boundary. This is possible if y is a point on both the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

For Crindlewop(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z not touching z's boundary. This is possible with a configuration like the one I described earlier.

Similarly, Narpulate(x,z) and Zindlequack(x,z) are possible by symmetric arguments.

For Frooblenap(x,z), we need x and z to be coincident. This is consistent with the premise because Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) would then be saying the same thing.

So it seems all eight relationships are possible! But that feels wrong, like I've missed something.

Let me check each one more carefully.

Blorpticate(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), y must touch both x and z at their boundaries, without x and z touching each other. This is geometrically possible, so Blorpticate(x,z) is possible.

Snarfloon(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior. This is possible if x, y, and z all touch at a common boundary point, or if y touches x and z at different points and x and z also happen to touch at some point. So Snarfloon(x,z) is possible.

Twizzlump(x,z): This means x and z share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), y must touch both x and z at their boundaries without entering the region where they overlap. This is geometrically possible, so Twizzlump(x,z) is possible.

Glimberish(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z touching z's boundary. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), y must touch both x and z at their boundaries without entering the interior of either. This is possible if y is a point on both the boundary of x and the boundary of z, and x is inside z touching z's boundary at that point. So Glimberish(x,z) is possible.

Crindlewop(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z not touching z's boundary. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), y must somehow touch both x and z at their boundaries without entering the interior of either. If x is inside z not touching z's boundary, and y touches x at its boundary, how can y also touch z at its boundary without entering the interior of z? This seems geometrically impossible. So Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

By the same logic, Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible either.

Frooblenap(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, then Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) are saying the same thing, which is consistent. So Frooblenap(x,z) is possible.

Let me check Narpulate(x,z), which I missed. This means z is a proper part of x touching x's boundary. By symmetric logic to Glimberish, this is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z given Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) are:
- Blorpticate(x,z)
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Frooblenap(x,z)

I've ruled out Crindlewop(x,z) and Zindlequack(x,z) as impossible.

Actually, I think I need to check my reasoning for Crindlewop and Zindlequack again. Let me draw it out in a different way.

For Crindlewop(x,z), we need:
- x is a proper part of z
- x does not touch z's boundary
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary without sharing interior
- Snarfloon(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior

If x is inside z not touching z's boundary, and y touches x at its boundary, can y also touch z at its boundary without entering the interior of z?

Actually, I think this is possible if y is a line segment or similar shape that extends from the boundary of x to the boundary of z. The key is that y itself doesn't have to be a simple point; it can be a more complex shape that bridges the gap between x and z.

For example:
- x is a small circle inside z, not touching z's boundary
- y is a line segment from the boundary of x to the boundary of z
- z is a large circle containing x

In this case:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary point without sharing interior
- Snarfloon(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary point without sharing interior
- Crindlewop(x,z): x is a proper part of z not touching z's boundary

So Crindlewop(x,z) is actually possible, and by symmetric logic, Zindlequack(x,z) is also possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z given Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) are:
- Blorpticate(x,z)
- Snarfloon(x,z)
- Twizzlump(x,z)
- Glimberish(x,z)
- Crindlewop(x,z)
- Narpulate(x,z)
- Zindlequack(x,z)
- Frooblenap(x,z)

Wait, that's all of them again! Let me check once more if I'm missing anything.

Actually, let me check Frooblenap(x,z) more carefully. This means x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, then Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) are saying that the same relationship holds between y and x/z. But then how can the relationship also be Snarfloon(x,z)? If x and z are the same, they're not touching at a boundary; they're the same entity.

I think I've been misinterpreting Frooblenap. Let me check the definition again.

Frooblenap(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

So Frooblenap(x,z) means x and z are the same entity. But if x and z are the same, then we have Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(x,y) again, which is just repeating the same condition. This is consistent with the premise, so Frooblenap(x,z) is possible.

But wait, that means x and z are the same entity. So we'd have Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,x)? I'm going to need to be more rigorous here.

Let's say we have regions X, Y, and Z, with Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z). We want to know what relationships are possible between X and Z.

If X and Z are coincident (Frooblenap), then X = Z. But then we have Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,X), which means X and Y touch at a boundary without sharing interior.

Is Snarfloon symmetric? Let's check the definition: Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

This looks symmetric to me. If x and y touch at a boundary without sharing interior, then y and x also touch at a boundary without sharing interior. So Snarfloon(x,y) implies Snarfloon(y,x).

But if Snarfloon is symmetric, then the premise gives us Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z), which is the same as Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Z,Y). This doesn't directly tell us anything about the relationship between X and Z unless X and Z are related through Y in some way.

Let me double-check if Snarfloon is indeed symmetric. Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. If we swap x and y, we get "y and x touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts," which is the same condition. So Snarfloon is symmetric, and Snarfloon(x,y) is the same as Snarfloon(y,x).

Now, if X and Z are coincident (Frooblenap), then X = Z. This means Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z) are the same statement, just with Z replaced by X. This is consistent with the premise, so Frooblenap(X,Z) is possible.

Let me check the other relationships again.

For Blorpticate(X,Z), we need X and Z to be disconnected. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z), Y must touch both X and Z at their boundaries, without X and Z touching each other. This is geometrically possible, so Blorpticate(X,Z) is possible.

For Snarfloon(X,Z), we need X and Z to touch at a boundary without sharing interior. This is possible if X, Y, and Z all touch at a common boundary point, or if Y touches X and Z at different points and X and Z also happen to touch at some point. So Snarfloon(X,Z) is possible.

For Twizzlump(X,Z), we need X and Z to share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z), Y must touch both X and Z at their boundaries without entering the region where they overlap. This is geometrically possible, so Twizzlump(X,Z) is possible.

For Glimberish(X,Z), we need X to be a proper part of Z touching Z's boundary. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z), Y must touch both X and Z at their boundaries without entering the interior of either. This is possible if Y is a point on both the boundary of X and the boundary of Z, and X is inside Z touching Z's boundary at that point. So Glimberish(X,Z) is possible.

For Crindlewop(X,Z), we need X to be a proper part of Z not touching Z's boundary. For this to be consistent with Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z), Y must somehow touch both X and Z at their boundaries without entering the interior of either. This is possible if Y is a line segment or similar shape that extends from the boundary of X to the boundary of Z. So Crindlewop(X,Z) is possible.

For Narpulate(X,Z), we need Z to be a proper part of X touching X's boundary. By symmetric logic to Glimberish, this is possible.

For Zindlequack(X,Z), we need Z to be a proper part of X not touching X's boundary. By symmetric logic to Crindlewop, this is possible.

So the possible relationships between X and Z given Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z) are:
- Blorpticate(X,Z)
- Snarfloon(X,Z)
- Twizzlump(X,Z)
- Glimberish(X,Z)
- Crindlewop(X,Z)
- Narpulate(X,Z)
- Zindlequack(X,Z)
- Frooblenap(X,Z)

I've now checked each relationship carefully, and I believe all eight are possible.

Actually, let me check Frooblenap(X,Z) one more time. This means X and Z are coincident, i.e., X = Z. But if X = Z, then we have Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,X). Is this consistent?

Snarfloon(X,Y) means X and Y touch at a boundary without sharing interior. Snarfloon(Y,X) means the same thing because Snarfloon is symmetric. So there's no contradiction here. The premise Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z) with Z = X is just saying that X and Y touch at a boundary without sharing interior, which is consistent. So Frooblenap(X,Z) is possible.

So the final answer is that all eight relationships are possible between X and Z given Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z).

Hmm, wait, I still feel like I'm missing something with Frooblenap. Let's be more specific.

Suppose we have Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z). If X and Z are coincident (Frooblenap), then X = Z. But then we have Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,X). This means X and Y touch at a boundary without sharing interior.

But if X and Y touch at a boundary without sharing interior, how can Y and X also touch at a boundary without sharing interior? It's the same relationship, but it feels like there's a contradiction here.

Actually, I'm forgetting that Snarfloon is symmetric, so Snarfloon(X,Y) is the same as Snarfloon(Y,X). So if X = Z, then the premise just gives us Snarfloon(X,Y) twice, which is consistent. So Frooblenap(X,Z) is indeed possible.

Let me summarize the possible relationships between X and Z given Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z):
- Blorpticate(X,Z)
- Snarfloon(X,Z)
- Twizzlump(X,Z)
- Glimberish(X,Z)
- Crindlewop(X,Z)
- Narpulate(X,Z)
- Zindlequack(X,Z)
- Frooblenap(X,Z)

I believe all eight relationships are possible, but I'm going to double-check my reasoning for each one more time.

For Frooblenap(X,Z), we need X = Z. If X = Z, then Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z) are the same statement, which is consistent. So Frooblenap(X,Z) is possible.

For Blorpticate(X,Z), we need X and Z to be disconnected. If X and Z are on opposite sides of Y, with Y touching both at their boundaries, then X and Z are disconnected. This is consistent with Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z). So Blorpticate(X,Z) is possible.

For Snarfloon(X,Z), we need X and Z to touch at a boundary without sharing interior. If X and Z both touch Y at a common boundary point, they might also touch each other at that point, which would give us Snarfloon(X,Z). So Snarfloon(X,Z) is possible.

For Twizzlump(X,Z), we need X and Z to share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. If X and Z overlap, and Y is a shape that touches both at their boundaries without entering their interiors, then we have Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z), and Twizzlump(X,Z). So Twizzlump(X,Z) is possible.

For Glimberish(X,Z), we need X to be a proper part of Z touching Z's boundary. If X is inside Z touching Z's boundary at a point, and Y is a point on both the boundary of X and the boundary of Z, then we have Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z), and Glimberish(X,Z). So Glimberish(X,Z) is possible.

For Crindlewop(X,Z), we need X to be a proper part of Z not touching Z's boundary. If X is inside Z not touching Z's boundary, and Y is a line segment from the boundary of X to the boundary of Z, then we have Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z), and Crindlewop(X,Z). So Crindlewop(X,Z) is possible.

For Narpulate(X,Z), we need Z to be a proper part of X touching X's boundary. By symmetric logic to Glimberish, this is possible.

For Zindlequack(X,Z), we need Z to be a proper part of X not touching X's boundary. By symmetric logic to Crindlewop, this is possible.

So all eight relationships are possible between X and Z given Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z).

Actually, I want to double-check my reasoning for Crindlewop(X,Z) one more time. The configuration I described was:
- X is a small circle inside Z, not touching Z's boundary
- Y is a line segment from the boundary of X to the boundary of Z
- Z is a large circle containing X

But does this satisfy Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z)? Snarfloon(X,Y) means X and Y touch at a boundary without sharing interior. If Y is a line segment from the boundary of X to the boundary of Z, then Y touches X at a boundary point, which is good. But Y itself has an interior (the points on the line segment), and it's not clear whether X and Y share any interior points.

Actually, let me reconsider what "touch at a boundary" means. It means there's at least one point that's on both the boundary of X and the boundary of Y, but no point that's in the interior of both X and Y.

For a line segment Y, the boundary consists of the two endpoints. So for X and Y to touch at a boundary, one of the endpoints of Y must be on the boundary of X, and no part of Y can be in the interior of X.

So the configuration I described does satisfy Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z). Y touches X at one of its endpoints (which is on the boundary of X), and Y touches Z at its other endpoint (which is on the boundary of Z). And neither X nor Z shares interior points with Y.

So Crindlewop(X,Z) is possible, and by symmetric logic, Zindlequack(X,Z) is also possible.

So the final answer is that all eight relationships are possible between X and Z given Snarfloon(X,Y) and Snarfloon(Y,Z):
- Blorpticate(X,Z)
- Snarfloon(X,Z)
- Twizzlump(X,Z)
- Glimberish(X,Z)
- Crindlewop(X,Z)
- Narpulate(X,Z)
- Zindlequack(X,Z)
- Frooblenap(X,Z)

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step, considering what's possible when Snarfloon(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) are true.

Recall that Snarfloon means "touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts."

Looking at all possible relationships between x and z:

1) Blorpticate(x,z): Possible. x and z can be completely disconnected if they touch y at different boundary points.

2) Snarfloon(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts, such as when all three regions meet at a common point.

3) Twizzlump(x,z): Possible. x and z can overlap while both touching y at their respective boundaries without y entering their overlap region.

4) Glimberish(x,z): Possible. x can be part of z and touch z's boundary, with y touching both at that boundary point.

5) Crindlewop(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z without touching z's boundary, with y extending from x's boundary to z's boundary.

6) Narpulate(x,z): Possible. By symmetry with Glimberish, z can be part of x and touch x's boundary.

7) Zindlequack(x,z): Possible. By symmetry with Crindlewop, z can be inside x without touching x's boundary.

8) Frooblenap(x,z): Possible. If x and z are coincident, the two given conditions become identical statements.

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z), Frooblenap(x,z)
