PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (i.e. z is a non-tangential proper part of y), x’s closure is disjoint from y’s closure and z’s closure is inside y’s interior.  Hence x’s closure is also disjoint from z’s closure, so the only possible RCC‐8 relation between x and z is DC.  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
