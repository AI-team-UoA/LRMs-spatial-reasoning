PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only base‐relations consistent with DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) are those in which x neither contains z nor is equal to z.  In fact one finds

   DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)

are all—and only—those compatible with DC(x,y) ∧ NTPPi(y,z).  

### Answer:  
Possible relations between x and z are  
  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
