PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y touches x’s boundary) and z is a tangential proper part of y (z touches y’s boundary).  Transitivity of “being a proper part” ensures that z is also a proper part of x, but there is no guarantee that z’s boundary must coincide with x’s boundary.  Consequently, from x’s perspective, z can be either a tangential proper part (if z also touches x’s boundary) or a non-tangential proper part (if it does not).  In RCC-8 terms, this means that the only possible relations are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
