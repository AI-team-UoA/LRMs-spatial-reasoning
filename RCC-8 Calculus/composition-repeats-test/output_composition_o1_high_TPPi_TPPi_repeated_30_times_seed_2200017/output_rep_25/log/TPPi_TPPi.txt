PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) holds, then y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y ⊂ x and their boundaries coincide at some place). Likewise, if TPPi(y,z) holds, then z is a tangential proper part of y (z ⊂ y with boundary contact). Transitivity guarantees that z is a proper part of x (z ⊂ x), but it does not force z’s boundary also to coincide with x’s boundary. Consequently, z may or may not touch x at the boundary, giving two possibilities:

• TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part, if z touches x’s boundary), or  
• NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part, if z does not touch x’s boundary).

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
