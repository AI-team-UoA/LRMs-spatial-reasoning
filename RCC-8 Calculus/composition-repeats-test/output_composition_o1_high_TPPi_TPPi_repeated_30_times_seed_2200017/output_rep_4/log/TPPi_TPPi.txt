PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y.  Because z lies (properly) inside y, and y lies (properly) inside x, it follows that z is a proper part of x.  Whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary cannot be determined from the given information alone.  Consequently, z could be either a tangential proper part of x or a non-tangential proper part of x.  

In RCC-8 notation (keeping x as the first argument and z as the second), those two cases correspond to the inverse relations TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
