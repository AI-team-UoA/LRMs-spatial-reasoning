PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then from the definitions it follows that y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y. Transitivity of “being a proper part” guarantees z is also a proper part of x, but there is no requirement that z’s boundary actually touches x’s boundary. Hence, z could be either a tangential part of x or a non-tangential part of x. In RCC-8 notation (with x in the first argument and z in the second), that corresponds to either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
