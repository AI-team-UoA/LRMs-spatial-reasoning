PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) holds, then y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)). Likewise, if TPPi(y,z) holds, then z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., TPP(z,y)). Because “being a proper part” is transitive, z is necessarily a proper part of x. However, depending on whether z also makes contact with x’s boundary (as y does), z may either be a tangential proper part of x or lie wholly inside x without boundary contact. In RCC-8 terms, that means:

• TPPi(x,z)  (i.e., TPP(z,x)), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x))  

are both possible.

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
