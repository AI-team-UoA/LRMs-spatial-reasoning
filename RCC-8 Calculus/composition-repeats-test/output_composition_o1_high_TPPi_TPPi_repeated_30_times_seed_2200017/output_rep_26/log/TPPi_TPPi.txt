PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From TPPi(x,y) we know TPP(y,x), i.e. y is a tangential proper part of x. Similarly, from TPPi(y,z) we know TPP(z,y), i.e. z is a tangential proper part of y. Because z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x, it follows that z ⊂ x. However, tangential containment need not transitively force z to “touch” x’s boundary. Hence, z could either be a tangential proper part of x or a non-tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 terms, that means:

• z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)), or  
• z is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)).  

Therefore, both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
