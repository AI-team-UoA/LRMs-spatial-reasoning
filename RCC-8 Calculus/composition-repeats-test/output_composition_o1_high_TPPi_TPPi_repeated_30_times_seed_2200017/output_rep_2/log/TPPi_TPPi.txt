PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y. Because z is wholly contained in y, and y is wholly contained in x (both with boundary contact), z must also lie strictly within x. However, whether z’s boundary also contacts x’s boundary is not determined by these two relations alone. Consequently, z could either be a tangential proper part of x or a non-tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 terms:

• TPPi(x,z) (z is tangentially included in x), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (z is non-tangentially included in x).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
