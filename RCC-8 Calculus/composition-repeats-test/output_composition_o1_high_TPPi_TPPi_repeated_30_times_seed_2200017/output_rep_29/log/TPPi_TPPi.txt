PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From TPPi(x,y) we know that y is a tangential proper part of x, and from TPPi(y,z) we know that z is a tangential proper part of y. Hence z < y < x. Consequently, z is a proper part of x. Depending on whether z’s boundary does or does not intersect x’s boundary, z can be either a tangential proper part of x (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(x,z)).  

### Answer: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
