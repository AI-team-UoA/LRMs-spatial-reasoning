{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "From TPPi(x,y) we know that y is a tangential proper part of x, and from TPPi(y,z) we know that z is a tangential proper part of y. Hence z < y < x. Consequently, z is a proper part of x. Depending on whether z\u2019s boundary does or does not intersect x\u2019s boundary, z can be either a tangential proper part of x (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(x,z)).  \n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 37.84542775154114, "reasoning-tokens": 2240, "completion-tokens": 2413}
