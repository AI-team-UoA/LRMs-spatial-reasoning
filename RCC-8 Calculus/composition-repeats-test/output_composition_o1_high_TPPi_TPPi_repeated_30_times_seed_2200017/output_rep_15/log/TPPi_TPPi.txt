PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From TPPi(x,y) we know y is a tangential proper part of x, and from TPPi(y,z) we know z is a tangential proper part of y.  In RCC-8 terms, that implies z < y < x.  Although transitivity ensures z < x, there is no guarantee that z must also touch xâ€™s boundary.  Consequently, z can be either a tangential or a non-tangential proper part of x.  In other words, the possible relations between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
