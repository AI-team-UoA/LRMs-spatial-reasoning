PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then, in standard RCC-8 terms, y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a tangential proper part of y.  In other words:

• TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x) ⇒ y ⊂ x and y’s boundary meets x’s boundary.  
• TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y) ⇒ z ⊂ y and z’s boundary meets y’s boundary.

Because z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x, it follows that z ⊂ x (z is a proper part of x).  However, whether z’s boundary also meets x’s boundary depends on the particular geometry; z might or might not “reach” x’s boundary under tangential containment of y in x.  Consequently, from x’s point of view, z can be either a tangential proper part of x or a non-tangential proper part of x.  In RCC-8 notation (expressing the relation R(x,z)) those two possibilities are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
