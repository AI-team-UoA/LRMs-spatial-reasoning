PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a tangential proper part of y. In particular, z is contained within y, which is contained within x, so z is necessarily a proper part of x. However, whether z’s boundary also meets x’s boundary (making z tangential to x) cannot be determined solely from the information given. Hence, from x’s perspective, z could either be a tangential proper part (TPPi(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part (NTPPi(x,z)) of x.

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
