PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x)—i.e. “y is a tangential proper part of x.” Thus:

• TPPi(x,y) ⇒ y is a tangential proper part of x.  
• TPPi(y,z) ⇒ z is a tangential proper part of y.

Since z is a (proper) part of y and y is a (proper) part of x, transitivity of “part-of” implies z is a proper part of x. Whether z also touches x’s boundary depends on whether the portion of y’s boundary that z touches coincides with x’s boundary. Consequently, z can be a tangential proper part of x (sharing boundary with x) or a non-tangential proper part of x (no boundary contact). In RCC-8 terms, that corresponds to:

• TPPi(x,z)  (i.e. TPP(z,x)), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e. NTPP(z,x)).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
