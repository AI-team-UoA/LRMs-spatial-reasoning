PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a tangential proper part of y. Consequently, z is strictly contained in x (because z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x). However, whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary is not determined by the given conditions. Hence, z may be a tangential proper part of x (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP). No other RCC-8 relations are possible under these circumstances.

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
