PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then by definition y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a tangential proper part of y.  In particular, y < x and z < y.  By transitivity of proper‐part relations, z < x.  

However, knowing only that z < y < x and that each “inner” part touches the boundary of its “outer” part does not guarantee that z also touches x’s boundary.  Consequently, z could be either a tangential proper part of x (if z’s boundary meets x’s boundary) or a non‐tangential proper part of x (if it does not).  

In RCC‐8 notation from the perspective R(x,z), that means either  
• TPPi(x,z) (z < x with boundary contact), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (z < x with no boundary contact).  

Thus there are exactly two possible relations between x and z:

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
