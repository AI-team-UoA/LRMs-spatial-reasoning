PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then by definition y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a tangential proper part of y. Hence z is a proper part of y, which is itself a proper part of x, so z is necessarily a proper part of x. However, depending on whether z’s boundary contacts x’s boundary (through y) or not, the relationship between x and z can be either tangential or non-tangential. In RCC-8 terms (with the first argument being the “larger” region in the i-relations), the possible relations are:  
• TPPi(x,z), if z touches x’s boundary, or  
• NTPPi(x,z), if z does not touch x’s boundary.  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
