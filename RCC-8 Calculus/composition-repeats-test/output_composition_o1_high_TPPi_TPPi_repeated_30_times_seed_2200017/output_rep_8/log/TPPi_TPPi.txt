PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then by definition y is a tangential proper part of x (so y < x) and z is a tangential proper part of y (so z < y). Transitivity of “being a (proper) part” implies z < x. However, from that alone we cannot force z to touch or not to touch x’s boundary; thus z < x could be either tangential or non‐tangential. In RCC‐8 terms (looking at R(x,z)), that means:

• TPPi(x,z)  (if z < x and z’s boundary touches x’s boundary), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (if z < x and z’s boundary does not touch x’s boundary).

No other RCC‐8 relations are consistent with z < x. 

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
