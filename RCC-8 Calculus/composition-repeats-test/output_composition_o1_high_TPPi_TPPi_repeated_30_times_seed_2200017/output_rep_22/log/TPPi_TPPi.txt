PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) holds, then y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., x is the larger region). Likewise, if TPPi(y,z) holds, then z is a tangential proper part of y (so y is larger than z). By transitivity of “part of,” z is also a proper part of x. However, from this information alone, one cannot tell whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary (which would make it tangential) or not (which would make it non‐tangential). Consequently, the only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:

• TPPi(x,z)  (i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., z is a non‐tangential proper part of x).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
