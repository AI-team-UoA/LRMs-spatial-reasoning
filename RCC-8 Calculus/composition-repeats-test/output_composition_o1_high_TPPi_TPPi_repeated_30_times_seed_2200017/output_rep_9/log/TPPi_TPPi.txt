PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y. By transitivity of parthood, z is a proper part of x. However, depending on whether z’s boundary also coincides with x’s boundary (through y), z may or may not be a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the two possible relationships between x and z are:

• TPPi(x,z) (z is tangentially a proper part of x)  
• NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
