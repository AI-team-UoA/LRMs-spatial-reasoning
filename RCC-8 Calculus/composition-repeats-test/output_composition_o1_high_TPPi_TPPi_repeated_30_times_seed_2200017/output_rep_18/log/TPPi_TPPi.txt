PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) holds, then by definition y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)). Likewise, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)). Chaining these:

• z < y (tangentially) and  
• y < x (tangentially)  

implies z < x. However, from z < x alone, we cannot conclude whether z merely lies in x’s interior (NTPP(z,x)) or also touches x’s boundary (TPP(z,x)). In “inverse” form (with x as the first argument):

• Either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).  

Hence there are two possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

• TPPi(x,z) (i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of x).  

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
