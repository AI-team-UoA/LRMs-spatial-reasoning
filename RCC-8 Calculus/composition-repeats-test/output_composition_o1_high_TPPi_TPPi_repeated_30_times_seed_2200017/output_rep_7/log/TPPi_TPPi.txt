PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then in RCC-8 terms y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y.  By transitivity of parthood, z is a proper part of x.  However, from this information alone one cannot determine whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary (making it tangential) or whether it lies fully in the interior of x (making it non-tangential).  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are exactly TPPi(x,z) (“z is a tangential proper part of x”) or NTPPi(x,z) (“z is a non-tangential proper part of x”).

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
