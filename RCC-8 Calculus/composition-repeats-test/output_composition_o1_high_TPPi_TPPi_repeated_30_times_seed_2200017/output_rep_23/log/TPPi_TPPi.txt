PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), that tells us that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y < x and y’s boundary touches x’s boundary). Likewise, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z < y and z’s boundary touches y’s boundary). By transitivity of “being a part of,” we have z < x. However, the point at which z touches y’s boundary need not coincide with the point at which y touches x’s boundary. Consequently, from x’s perspective, z can either be a tangential proper part (if they share a boundary point) or a non-tangential proper part (if they do not). Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are:

• TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)  
• NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x)

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
