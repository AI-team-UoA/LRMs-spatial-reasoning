PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a tangential proper part of y.  By transitivity of the part relation, z is necessarily a proper part of x.  However, nothing in the tangential‐proper‐part assumptions forces z to touch x’s boundary; z may or may not also be tangential to x.  Hence z could be either a tangential proper part of x or a non‐tangential proper part of x.  In RCC-8 notation, that translates to either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
