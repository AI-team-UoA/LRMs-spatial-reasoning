PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then by definition y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y. Because “is a proper part of” is transitive, z is necessarily a proper part of x. Whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary (making it tangential) or not (making it non-tangential) cannot be determined solely from the given information. Hence the only possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:

• TPPi(x,z)  (i.e., TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
