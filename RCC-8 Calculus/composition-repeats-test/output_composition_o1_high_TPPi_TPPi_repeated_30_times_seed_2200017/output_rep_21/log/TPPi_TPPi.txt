PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y. Because y (with z inside) sits inside x, z must also be a proper part of x; however, depending on how z touches y’s boundary (and how that portion of y’s boundary sits relative to x), z may or may not touch x’s boundary. Consequently, z can be either a tangential proper part of x or a non-tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 terms, this corresponds to:

• TPPi(x,z)  (i.e., TPP(z,x))  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x))  

Thus both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
