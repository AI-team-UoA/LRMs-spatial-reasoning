PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) holds, then y is a tangential proper part of x (y < x and their boundaries touch). Likewise, if TPPi(y,z) holds, then z is a tangential proper part of y (z < y and their boundaries touch). From z < y and y < x, it follows that z < x. However, whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary depends on the specific configuration:

• It can happen that z also touches x’s boundary (so z is a tangential proper part of x).  
• It can also happen that z lies entirely in the interior of x without touching x’s boundary (so z is a non-tangential proper part of x).

Hence the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
