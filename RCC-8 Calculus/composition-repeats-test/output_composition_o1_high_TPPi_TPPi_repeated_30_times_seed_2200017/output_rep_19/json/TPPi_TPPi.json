{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then in both cases y and z are (tangential) proper parts of the larger region in the pair.  Concretely:\n\n\u2022 TPPi(x,y) \u2261 TPP(y,x) says \u201cy is a tangential proper part of x.\u201d  \n\u2022 TPPi(y,z) \u2261 TPP(z,y) says \u201cz is a tangential proper part of y.\u201d  \n\nBy transitivity of parthood, z is also a proper part of x.  However, whether z\u2019s boundary also touches x\u2019s boundary (making it \u201ctangential\u201d) depends on the specific geometry.  Consequently, z may be a tangential proper part of x or a non\u2010tangential proper part of x.  In RCC\u20118 terms (with x as the first argument):\n\n\u2022 TPPi(x,z)  (\u201cz is a tangential proper part of x\u201d), or  \n\u2022 NTPPi(x,z) (\u201cz is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x\u201d).\n\nBoth are possible.  \n\n### Answer:\nTPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 65.01847290992737, "reasoning-tokens": 3392, "completion-tokens": 3705}
