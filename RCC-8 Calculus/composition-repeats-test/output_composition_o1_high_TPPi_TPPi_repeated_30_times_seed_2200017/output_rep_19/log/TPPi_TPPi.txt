PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then in both cases y and z are (tangential) proper parts of the larger region in the pair.  Concretely:

• TPPi(x,y) ≡ TPP(y,x) says “y is a tangential proper part of x.”  
• TPPi(y,z) ≡ TPP(z,y) says “z is a tangential proper part of y.”  

By transitivity of parthood, z is also a proper part of x.  However, whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary (making it “tangential”) depends on the specific geometry.  Consequently, z may be a tangential proper part of x or a non‐tangential proper part of x.  In RCC‑8 terms (with x as the first argument):

• TPPi(x,z)  (“z is a tangential proper part of x”), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (“z is a non‐tangential proper part of x”).

Both are possible.  

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
