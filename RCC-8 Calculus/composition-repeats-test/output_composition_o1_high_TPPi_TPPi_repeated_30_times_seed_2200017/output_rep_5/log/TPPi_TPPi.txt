PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) (i.e. y is a tangential proper part of x) and TPPi(y,z) (i.e. z is a tangential proper part of y), then z is necessarily a proper part of x (since z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x). However, whether z’s boundary also meets x’s boundary depends on whether the portion of y’s boundary that z touches coincides with x’s boundary or lies fully in the interior of x. Hence z may either be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(x,z)) or a tangential proper part of x (TPP(x,z)). 

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
