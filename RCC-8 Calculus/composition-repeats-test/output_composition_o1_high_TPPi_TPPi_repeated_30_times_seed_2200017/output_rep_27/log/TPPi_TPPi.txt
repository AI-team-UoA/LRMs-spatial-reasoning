PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) (i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x) and TPPi(y,z) (i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y), then by transitivity z is a proper part of x (z < x). However, from these premises alone we cannot determine whether z also shares a boundary with x or lies entirely in x’s interior. Consequently, z could either be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)) if it does contact x’s boundary, or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)) if it does not. 

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
