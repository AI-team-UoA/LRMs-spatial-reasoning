PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y.  In other words, x fully contains y (with boundary contact) and y fully contains z (also with boundary contact).  From this it follows that x fully contains z.  However, there is no requirement that z’s boundary must also touch x’s boundary.  Consequently, z may or may not be tangentially “up against” x.  

In RCC-8 terms (with the first argument as the “container”), x and z can therefore be either:  
• TPPi(x,z) (if z also touches x’s boundary), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (if z does not touch x’s boundary).  

Thus the possible relationships between x and z are:  
### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
