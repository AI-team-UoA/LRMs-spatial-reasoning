PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y.  By transitivity of containment, z is also a proper part of x.  However, whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary is not forced by the two given tangential‐containment relations.  Hence, x may contain z either tangentially or non‐tangentially.  In RCC‐8 terms, the possible relations are:

• TPPi(x,z)  (z is tangentially contained in x), or  
• NTPPi(x,z) (z is non‐tangentially contained in x).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
