PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) (x’s closure disjoint from y) and NTPPi(y,z) (y is a non-tangential proper part of z), y lies strictly inside z, so x—being disjoint from y—can lie entirely outside z or partially/fully inside the “annular” region of z around y, but can never coincide with or properly contain z.  The only RCC-8 relations it can then have with z are:

DC(x,z)  
EC(x,z)  
PO(x,z)  
TPP(x,z)  
NTPP(x,z)

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
