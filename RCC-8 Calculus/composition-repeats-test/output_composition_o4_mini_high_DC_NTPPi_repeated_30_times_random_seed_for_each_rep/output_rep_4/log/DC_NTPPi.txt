PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since z is a (non‐tangential) proper part of y, any point of z lies inside y. But x is completely disconnected from y (no touching of closures), so x cannot touch or overlap z. Hence the only possible RCC‐8 relation between x and z is DC.  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
