PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) (“x” and “y” share no points) and NTPPi(y,z)=NTPP(z,y) (“z” lies wholly in the interior of “y”), it follows that “x” lies outside “y” and hence outside “z.”  Therefore the only RCC-8 relation that can hold between “x” and “z” is DC.  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
