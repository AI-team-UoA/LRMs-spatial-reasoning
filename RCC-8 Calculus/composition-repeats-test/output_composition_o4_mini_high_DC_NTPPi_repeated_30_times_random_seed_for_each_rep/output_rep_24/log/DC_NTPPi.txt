PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) (x disjoint from y) and NTPPi(y,z) (y is a non‐tangential proper part of z, i.e. y⊂int(z)), x can lie entirely outside z, touch z’s boundary, partially overlap z, or lie wholly inside z (touching or not touching its boundary)—but it cannot coincide with z or contain z (that would force x∩y≠∅).  Hence the only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:

DC(x,z)  
EC(x,z)  
PO(x,z)  
TPP(x,z)  
NTPP(x,z)  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z)
