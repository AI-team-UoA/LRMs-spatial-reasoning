PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) (so Cl(x) ∩ Cl(y) = ∅) and NTPPi(y,z) (⇔ NTPP(z,y), so Cl(z) ⊂ Int(y)), we have Cl(z) ⊆ Int(y) and Cl(x) ∩ Cl(y) = ∅ ⇒ Cl(x) ∩ Cl(z) = ∅.  Hence the only possible RCC‐8 relation between x and z is DC.  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
