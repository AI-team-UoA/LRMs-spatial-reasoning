PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) (x disjoint from y) and NTPPi(y,z) (z is a non‐tangential proper part of y), z lies entirely inside y’s interior while x has empty intersection even with y’s closure.  Hence x and z must also be completely disconnected.  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
