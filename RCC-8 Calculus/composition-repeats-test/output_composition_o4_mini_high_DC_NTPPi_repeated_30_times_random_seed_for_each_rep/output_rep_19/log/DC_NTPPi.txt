PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) ⇒ closure(x) ∩ closure(y) = ∅, and NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y) ⇒ closure(z) ⊆ interior(y).  
Hence closure(x) ∩ closure(z) ⊆ closure(x) ∩ closure(y) = ∅, so x and z are disconnected.  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
