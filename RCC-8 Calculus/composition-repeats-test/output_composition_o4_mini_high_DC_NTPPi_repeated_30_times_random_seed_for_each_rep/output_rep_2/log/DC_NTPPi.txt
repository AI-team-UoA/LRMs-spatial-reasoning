PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If DC(x,y) then closure(x)∩closure(y)=∅.  Since NTPPi(y,z) is NTPP(z,y), we have closure(z)⊆int(y), so closure(x)∩closure(z)=∅.  Hence the only possible RCC‐8 relation between x and z is DC.  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
