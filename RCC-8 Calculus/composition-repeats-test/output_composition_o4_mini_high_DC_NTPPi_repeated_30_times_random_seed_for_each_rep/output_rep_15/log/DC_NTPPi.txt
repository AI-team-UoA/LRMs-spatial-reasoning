PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z ⊂ int(y)), and DC(x,y) means x and y share no points (closure(x) ∩ closure(y) = ∅), x cannot meet z at all.  Hence the only consistent RCC-8 relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
