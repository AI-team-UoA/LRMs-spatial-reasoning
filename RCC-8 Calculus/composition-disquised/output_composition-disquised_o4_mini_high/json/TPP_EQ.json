{"prompt": "If Glimberish(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a tangential proper\u2010part of y, and y coincides with z, then x must be a tangential proper\u2010part of z.  No other of the eight mutually\u2010exclusive relations can hold.  \n\n### Answer:  \nGlimberish(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 25.699397563934326, "reasoning-tokens": 2560, "completion-tokens": 2634}
