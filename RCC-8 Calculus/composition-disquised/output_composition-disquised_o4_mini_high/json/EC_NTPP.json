{"prompt": "If Snarfloon(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "When y is a strict (non\u2010tangential) part of z and x merely touches y, x must intersect the interior of z.  Depending on whether x runs outside z or whether it also touches z\u2019s boundary, x can overlap z or be a proper part (tangential or non\u2010tangential).  \n\n### Answer:  \nTwizzlump(x,z)  \nGlimberish(x,z)  \nCrindlewop(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 32.25144624710083, "reasoning-tokens": 3264, "completion-tokens": 3377}
