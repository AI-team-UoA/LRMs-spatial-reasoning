{"prompt": "If Blorpticate(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since Blorpticate(x,y) says x is completely separate from y, and Zindlequack(y,z) says z lies entirely inside y (without touching y\u2019s boundary), x cannot touch or overlap z either.  Hence the only possible relation is  \n\n### Answer:  \nBlorpticate(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 26.316079139709473, "reasoning-tokens": 3008, "completion-tokens": 3091}
