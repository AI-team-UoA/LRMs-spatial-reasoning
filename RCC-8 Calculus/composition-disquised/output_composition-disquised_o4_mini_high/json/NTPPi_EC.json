{"prompt": "If Zindlequack(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that  \n 1. Zindlequack(x,y) means y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x (y\u00a0\u2282int(x)), and  \n 2. Snarfloon(y,z) means y and z meet exactly at a boundary point (cl(y)\u2229cl(z)\u2260\u2205 but int(y)\u2229int(z)=\u2205),  \n\nthe boundary point where y and z touch lies in int(x), so z must penetrate into x.  Hence x and z always share interior points, but neither can have x\u2282z.  The only RCC\u20118 relations left are those where z overlaps or is inside x:\n\n  \u2022 Twizzlump(x,z)      (partial overlap)  \n  \u2022 Narpulate(x,z)     (z is a tangential proper part of x)  \n  \u2022 Zindlequack(x,z)   (z is a non\u2011tangential proper part of x)  \n\n### Answer:  \nTwizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or\u00a0Zindlequack(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 136.19476556777954, "reasoning-tokens": 14656, "completion-tokens": 14902}
