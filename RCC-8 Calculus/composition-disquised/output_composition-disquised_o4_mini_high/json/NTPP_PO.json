{"prompt": "If Crindlewop(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given x\u00a0Crindlewop\u00a0y (x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of y) and y\u00a0Twizzlump\u00a0z (y partially overlaps z), x can lie entirely outside, touching, straddling or entirely inside the overlap with z.  Working out all cases shows that x\u00a0z may stand in exactly five of the eight relations:\n\n  \u2022 Blorpticate(x,z)  \n  \u2022 Snarfloon(x,z)  \n  \u2022 Twizzlump(x,z)  \n  \u2022 Glimberish(x,z)  \n  \u2022 Crindlewop(x,z)\n\n### Answer:\nBlorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 49.75787162780762, "reasoning-tokens": 6976, "completion-tokens": 7156}
