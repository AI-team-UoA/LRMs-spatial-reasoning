Hence x cannot be DC from z.  On the other hand, depending on whether x pokes into the interior of z or merely touches its boundary (and whether x stays entirely inside z or partly outside), the only possibilities for x\u2013z are\n\n  EC(x,z)      Snarfloon  \n  PO(x,z)      Twizzlump  \n  TPP(x,z)     Glimberish  \n  NTPP(x,z)    Crindlewop  \n\n### Answer:  \nSnarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 119.36625027656555, "reasoning-tokens": 12928, "completion-tokens": 13233}
