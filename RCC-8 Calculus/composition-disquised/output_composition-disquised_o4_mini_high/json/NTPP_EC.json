{"prompt": "If Crindlewop(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given Crindlewop(x,y) we know x is a proper part of y and lies entirely in y\u2019s interior.  Snarfloon(y,z) tells us y and z touch only at y\u2019s boundary, with no interior overlap.  Hence x (being away from y\u2019s boundary) can neither overlap nor even touch z.  The only relation that fits is\n\n### Answer: Blorpticate(x,\u00a0z)", "elapsed-time": 25.098276138305664, "reasoning-tokens": 2944, "completion-tokens": 3051}
