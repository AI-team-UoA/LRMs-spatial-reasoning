{"prompt": "If Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given Glimberish(x,y) (x is a tangential proper part of y) and Narpulate(y,z) (y is a tangential proper part of z), x must be a proper part of z.  Whether x touches z\u2019s boundary depends on where x touches y\u2019s boundary relative to z\u2019s boundary, so the only possibilities are\n\n\u2022 Glimberish(x,z)  \n\u2022 Crindlewop(x,z)  \n\n### Answer:  \nGlimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 27.340940713882446, "reasoning-tokens": 1600, "completion-tokens": 1723}
