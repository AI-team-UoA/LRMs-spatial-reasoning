{"prompt": "If Crindlewop(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since x is a non\u2011tangential proper part of y (Crindlewop(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (Glimberish(y,z)), x must lie wholly inside z\u2019s interior and never touch z\u2019s boundary.  Hence the only POSSIBLE relation is that x is a non\u2011tangential proper part of z.  \n\n### Answer:  \nCrindlewop(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 48.84335517883301, "reasoning-tokens": 3840, "completion-tokens": 3947}
