PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The two of them must stand in a proper‐part relation, and that part may or may not reach x’s boundary.  In our terms that means

  • either z is a tangential proper‐part of x (Glimberish(z,x), i.e. Narpulate(x,z))  
  • or z is a non‐tangential proper‐part of x (Crindlewop(z,x), i.e. Zindlequack(x,z))

### Answer:
Either Narpulate(x,z) or Zindlequack(x,z).
