PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since Zindlequack(x,y) means “y ⊏ x (proper part) and y does not touch x’s boundary” and likewise Zindlequack(y,z) means “z ⊏ y and z does not touch y’s boundary,” by mereological transitivity we get

 z ⊏ y ⊏ x  

and, because neither y nor z ever touches the boundary of its container, z cannot touch x’s boundary.  Hence z is a proper interior‐part of x, i.e. Crindlewop(z,x), which by definition is Zindlequack(x,z). No other of the eight relations can hold.  

### Answer: Zindlequack(x,z)
