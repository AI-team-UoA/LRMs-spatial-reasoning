PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations are exactly those where x and z can either be disconnected, merely touch, overlap, or x can sit (tangentially or nontangentially) inside z.  In the given terminology these are:

Blorpticate(x,z),  
Snarfloon(x,z),  
Twizzlump(x,z),  
Glimberish(x,z),  
Crindlewop(x,z)  

### Answer:  
Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z)
