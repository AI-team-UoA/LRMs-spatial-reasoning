PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the standard RCC‐8 interpretation of “Twizzlump” as PO, one shows by “lobe‐and‐bridge” constructions that if  
  Twizzlump(x,y)  and  Twizzlump(y,z)  
then the only possible RCC‐8 atoms relating x to z are

  • DC    (Blorpticate(x,z))  
  • EC    (Snarfloon(x,z))  
  • PO    (Twizzlump(x,z))  
  • TPP   (Glimberish(x,z))  
  • TPPI  (Narpulate(x,z))  

All other base‐relations (NTPP, NTPPI, EQ) cannot be forced by two successive PO‐constraints alone.  

### Answer:  
Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Narpulate(x,z)
