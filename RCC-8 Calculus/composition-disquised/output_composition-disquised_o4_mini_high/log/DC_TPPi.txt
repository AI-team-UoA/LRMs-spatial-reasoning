PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Blorpticate(x,y) then x’s closure is disjoint from y’s closure.  Since Narpulate(y,z) means z is a (tangential) part of y, z’s closure sits inside y’s closure.  Hence x’s closure is also disjoint from z’s closure, forcing DC(x,z), i.e.  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z)
