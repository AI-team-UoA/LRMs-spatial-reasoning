PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
Given  
  • Crindlewop(x,y)  (x is a non‐tangential proper part of y)  
  • Zindlequack(y,z) ≡ Crindlewop(z,y)  (z is a non‐tangential proper part of y)  

x and z are two (possibly overlapping or disjoint) subregions both entirely in the interior of y.  Therefore all eight of the basic relations remain possible between x and z:
  1. Blorpticate(x,z)  
  2. Snarfloon(x,z)  
  3. Twizzlump(x,z)  
  4. Glimberish(x,z)  
  5. Crindlewop(x,z)  
  6. Narpulate(x,z)  
  7. Zindlequack(x,z)  
  8. Frooblenap(x,z)
