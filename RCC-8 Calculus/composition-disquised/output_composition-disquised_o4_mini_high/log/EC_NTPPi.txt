PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Snarfloon(x,y) (external‐connection: x touches y’s boundary but doesn’t enter y) and Zindlequack(y,z) (inverse non‑tangential proper‑part: z sits strictly inside y away from y’s boundary), x cannot meet or overlap z.  The only RCC8–type relation left is disconnection:

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z)
