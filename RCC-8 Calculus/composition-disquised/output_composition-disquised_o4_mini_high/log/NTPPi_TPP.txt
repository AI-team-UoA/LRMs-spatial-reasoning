PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only relations compatible with  
  Zindlequack(x,y) (i.e. y ⊂int x)  
  and  
  Glimberish(y,z) (i.e. y ⊂ z & y touches ∂z)  
are those in which x and z overlap but x is not contained in z.  Equivalently, the possible RCC‐8 types are  
  – PO (Twizzlump)  
  – TPP^{-1} (Narpulate)  
  – NTPP^{-1} (Zindlequack)  

### Answer:  
Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z) or Zindlequack(x,z).
