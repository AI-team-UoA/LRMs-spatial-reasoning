PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given x Crindlewop y (x is a non‐tangential proper part of y) and y Twizzlump z (y partially overlaps z), x can lie entirely outside, touching, straddling or entirely inside the overlap with z.  Working out all cases shows that x z may stand in exactly five of the eight relations:

  • Blorpticate(x,z)  
  • Snarfloon(x,z)  
  • Twizzlump(x,z)  
  • Glimberish(x,z)  
  • Crindlewop(x,z)

### Answer:
Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z)
