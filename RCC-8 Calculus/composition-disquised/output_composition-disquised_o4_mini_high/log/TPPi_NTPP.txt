PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The fact that  
 1. Narpulate(x,y)  ⇒ y  is part of x and touches x’s boundary  
 2. Crindlewop(y,z) ⇒ y  is part of z and does not touch z’s boundary  
means x and z both share the part y but neither can coincide or be disjoint.  Hence between x and z the only possible RCC‐style relations are:

• Twizzlump(x,z)   (they overlap but neither contains the other)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  (x is part of z and touches z’s boundary)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)  (x is part of z and does not touch z’s boundary)  
• Narpulate(x,z)   (z is part of x and touches x’s boundary)  

### Answer:  
Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z) or Narpulate(x,z).
