PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given  
  Zindlequack(x,y)  ⇒  Crindlewop(y,x)  (y is a non‐tangential proper part of x)  
  Crindlewop(y,z)  (y is a non‐tangential proper part of z)  

we know y lies strictly inside both x and z.  Hence x and z must share the interior region y, so they cannot be Blorpticate or Snarfloon.  Apart from those two, any of the other six base‐relations is consistent:

  • Twizzlump(x,z)       – x and z overlap but neither is part of the other  
  • Glimberish(x,z)      – x ⊏ z and x touches z’s boundary  
  • Crindlewop(x,z)      – x ⊏ z and x does not touch z’s boundary  
  • Narpulate(x,z)       – z ⊏ x and z touches x’s boundary  
  • Zindlequack(x,z)     – z ⊏ x and z does not touch x’s boundary  
  • Frooblenap(x,z)      – x coincides exactly with z  

### Answer:  
Possible relations between x and z are  
  Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z), or Frooblenap(x,z).
