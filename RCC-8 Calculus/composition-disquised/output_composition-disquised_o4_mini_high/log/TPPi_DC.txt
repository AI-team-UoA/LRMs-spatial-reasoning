PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We know  
1. Narpulate(x,y) ⇒ y is a proper part of x and y touches x’s boundary.  
2. Blorpticate(y,z) ⇒ y and z are completely disjoint (no shared parts, not even boundary).  

Since y⊂x and z∩y=∅, z must lie either entirely outside x, entirely inside the “remainder” of x (x∖y), or straddle that remainder and the exterior of x.  Examining all eight relations in turn shows that the only consistent ones for (x,z) are:

- Blorpticate(x,z): z lies wholly outside x.  
- Snarfloon(x,z): z lies outside x but touches x’s boundary at some point not occupied by y.  
- Twizzlump(x,z): z overlaps x (in x∖y) but also has parts outside x.  
- Narpulate(x,z) (≡ Glimberish(z,x)): z is a proper part of x and touches x’s boundary (in a region not used by y).  
- Zindlequack(x,z) (≡ Crindlewop(z,x)): z is a proper part of x but does not touch x’s boundary.  

### Answer:  
Blorpticate(x,z),  
Snarfloon(x,z),  
Twizzlump(x,z),  
Narpulate(x,z),  
Zindlequack(x,z)
