PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Narpulate(x,y) (i.e. y is a tangential proper‐part of x) and Snarfloon(y,z) (i.e. y is externally connected to z), the only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:

  • Snarfloon(x,z)  
  • Twizzlump(x,z)  
  • Narpulate(x,z)  
  • Zindlequack(x,z)

### Answer:  
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z)
