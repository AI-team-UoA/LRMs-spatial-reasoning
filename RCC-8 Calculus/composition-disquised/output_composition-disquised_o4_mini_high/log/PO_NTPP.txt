PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Here Twizzlump(x,y) is like “PO” and Crindlewop(y,z) is “NTPP.”  In RCC‐8 one has

  PO ◦ NTPP  =  PO ∪ TPP ∪ NTPP

so x and z must share some interior point (ruling out DC and EC) and x≠z (ruling out EQ), but x may either lie partly outside z (PO), lie entirely inside z touching its boundary (TPP), or lie entirely inside not touching its boundary (NTPP).  

### Answer:  
Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z)
