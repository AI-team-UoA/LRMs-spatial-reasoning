PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper‐part of y, and y coincides with z, then x must be a tangential proper‐part of z.  No other of the eight mutually‐exclusive relations can hold.  

### Answer:  
Glimberish(x,z)
