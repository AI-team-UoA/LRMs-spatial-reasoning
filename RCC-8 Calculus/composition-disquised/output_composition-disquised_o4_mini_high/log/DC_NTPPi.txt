PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since Blorpticate(x,y) says x is completely separate from y, and Zindlequack(y,z) says z lies entirely inside y (without touching yâ€™s boundary), x cannot touch or overlap z either.  Hence the only possible relation is
