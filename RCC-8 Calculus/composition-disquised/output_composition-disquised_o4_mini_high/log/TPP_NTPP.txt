PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since x ⊏ y and y ⊏ z, transitivity of “part‑of” gives x ⊏ z.  And because y’s boundary doesn’t meet z’s boundary, x (being inside y) can’t reach z’s boundary.  Hence the only fitting relation is
