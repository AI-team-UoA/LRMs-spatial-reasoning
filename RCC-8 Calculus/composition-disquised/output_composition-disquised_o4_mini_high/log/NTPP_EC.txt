PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Crindlewop(x,y) we know x is a proper part of y and lies entirely in y’s interior.  Snarfloon(y,z) tells us y and z touch only at y’s boundary, with no interior overlap.  Hence x (being away from y’s boundary) can neither overlap nor even touch z.  The only relation that fits is

### Answer: Blorpticate(x, z)
