PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:

All eight of the base relations are possible between x and z.  In other words, knowing only that  
Blorpticate(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z)  
places no further constraint on x and z, so they may stand in any one of:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  
• Frooblenap(x,z)
