PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that Narpulate(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, and Twizzlump(y,z) means y and z overlap (neither contains the other), z may

  1. lie entirely inside x (either touching x’s boundary or not), or  
  2. overlap x without being contained.

Hence the only possible relations between x and z are:

  • Twizzlump(x,z)  
  • Narpulate(x,z)  
  • Zindlequack(x,z)

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z)
