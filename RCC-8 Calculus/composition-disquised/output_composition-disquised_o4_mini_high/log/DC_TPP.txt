PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given only that x is disconnected from y and that y is a proper part of z touching z’s boundary, x can end up in z in any of the “outside,” “boundary‐touching,” “overlapping” or “inside” configurations – but never as a superset or equal to z.  In terms of our eight relations the only possible ones between x and z are

  • Blorpticate(x,z)  
  • Snarfloon(x,z)  
  • Twizzlump(x,z)  
  • Glimberish(x,z)  
  • Crindlewop(x,z)

(The relations Narpulate, Zindlequack and Frooblenap would force x to contain or coincide with z, which contradicts x’s disconnection from the y ⊂ z.)
