PROMPT: If Blorpticate(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only possibilities are that x and z are  
  – Blorpticate(x,z)  
  – Snarfloon(x,z)  
  – Twizzlump(x,z)  
  – Glimberish(x,z)  
  – Crindlewop(x,z)  

No other of the eight relations can hold.  
### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z)
