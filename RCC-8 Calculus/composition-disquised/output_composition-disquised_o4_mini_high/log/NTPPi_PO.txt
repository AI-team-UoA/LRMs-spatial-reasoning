PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that  
 1. Zindlequack(x,y) says “y is a proper part of x and lies entirely in x’s interior,”  
 2. Twizzlump(y,z) says “y and z overlap but neither is a part of the other,”  

we know y⊂int(x) and y∩z has non‐empty interior.  Hence z must also meet the interior of x, so x and z share a spatial part.  The only admissible relations (of the eight) between x and z are then:

  • Twizzlump(x,z)  
     (x and z overlap without one containing the other)  
  • Narpulate(x,z)  
     (z⊂x and z touches x’s boundary)  
  • Zindlequack(x,z)  
     (z⊂x and z does not touch x’s boundary)  

All other RCC–style relations are ruled out by the given constraints.  

### Answer:  
Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
