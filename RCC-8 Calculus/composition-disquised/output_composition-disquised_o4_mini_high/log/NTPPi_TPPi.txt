PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only way to “nest” a non‐tangential part inside a tangential part without ever touching the outer boundary is to stay non‐tangential.  Hence the sole possible relation is  
Zindlequack(x,z).
