PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that  
  • Crindlewop(x,y) says x is a non‐tangential proper part of y (x⊏y, x doesn’t touch ∂y)  
  • Narpulate(y,z) = Glimberish(z,y) says z is a tangential proper part of y (z⊏y, z does touch ∂y)  

x and z are both inside y, but x stays away from y’s boundary while z reaches it.  Hence between x and z you cannot have z⊏x or equality, but you can have all the “partial” configurations where x lies wholly outside z, just touches z, overlaps z, or lies wholly inside z in either a tangential or non‐tangential way.  Concretely, the only possible relations are:

  • Blorpticate(x,z)  
  • Snarfloon(x,z)  
  • Twizzlump(x,z)  
  • Glimberish(x,z)  
  • Crindlewop(x,z)  

### Answer:  
Blorpticate(x,z); Snarfloon(x,z); Twizzlump(x,z); Glimberish(x,z); Crindlewop(x,z)
