PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

When y is a strict (non‐tangential) part of z and x merely touches y, x must intersect the interior of z.  Depending on whether x runs outside z or whether it also touches z’s boundary, x can overlap z or be a proper part (tangential or non‐tangential).  

### Answer:  
Twizzlump(x,z)  
Glimberish(x,z)  
Crindlewop(x,z)
