PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The key observation is that the unique boundary‐contact point p between x and y (since Snarfloon(x,y)) may lie entirely outside z, on z’s boundary, or in z’s interior – and in the interior case x may either stick out of z or lie wholly inside z.  Working through these cases one finds exactly five consistent RCC–style relations between x and z:

  • Blorpticate(x,z)  
    (x and z are disconnected; p lies outside z)  
  • Snarfloon(x,z)  
    (x and z touch at p which lies on ∂z)  
  • Twizzlump(x,z)  
    (x and z properly overlap; p ∈ int z but part of x’s interior also lies outside z)  
  • Glimberish(x,z)  
    (x is a proper part of z and touches ∂z; p ∈ ∂z and x ⊆ z)  
  • Crindlewop(x,z)  
    (x is a proper part of z with no boundary‐touching; p ∈ int z and x ⊆ int z)

### Answer:
Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z)
