PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Glimberish(x,y) (x is a tangential proper part of y) and Narpulate(y,z) (y is a tangential proper part of z), x must be a proper part of z.  Whether x touches z’s boundary depends on where x touches y’s boundary relative to z’s boundary, so the only possibilities are

• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)  

### Answer:  
Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z)
