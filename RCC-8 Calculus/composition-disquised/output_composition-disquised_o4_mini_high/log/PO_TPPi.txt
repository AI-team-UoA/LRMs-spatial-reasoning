PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Twizzlump(x,y) (x and y overlap but neither is part of the other) and Narpulate(y,z) (z is a proper part of y touching y’s boundary), x may relate to z in any of the following five mutually‐exclusive ways:

  • Blorpticate(x,z): x is disconnected from z  
  • Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary only  
  • Twizzlump(x,z): x and z overlap (share interior) but neither is part of the other  
  • Narpulate(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x’s boundary  
  • Zindlequack(x,z): z is a proper part of x and does not touch x’s boundary  

### Answer:  
Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z)
