PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From EC(x,y) and the fact that z is a tangential proper‐part of y, one shows that x’s interior and z’s interior must remain disjoint, while their closures may either meet or not.  Hence the only possible relations are  
  • Blorpticate(x,z) (disconnected)  
  • Snarfloon(x,z) (externally connected)  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z) or Snarfloon(x,z)
