PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:

The only RCC‐8 relations consistent with  
 Twizzlump(x,y) (x PO y)  
and  
 Blorpticate(y,z) (y DC z)  
are that x and z be one of

  • Blorpticate(x,z)  
  • Snarfloon(x,z)  
  • Twizzlump(x,z)  
  • Narpulate(x,z)  
  • Zindlequack(x,z)  

In other words, x and z may be DC, EC, PO, TPP⁻¹ (Narpulate), or NTPP⁻¹ (Zindlequack).
