PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since x is a non‑tangential proper part of y (Crindlewop(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (Glimberish(y,z)), x must lie wholly inside z’s interior and never touch z’s boundary.  Hence the only POSSIBLE relation is that x is a non‑tangential proper part of z.  

### Answer:  
Crindlewop(x,z)
