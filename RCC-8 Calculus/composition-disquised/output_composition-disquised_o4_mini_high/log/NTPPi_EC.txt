PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that  
 1. Zindlequack(x,y) means y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (y ⊂int(x)), and  
 2. Snarfloon(y,z) means y and z meet exactly at a boundary point (cl(y)∩cl(z)≠∅ but int(y)∩int(z)=∅),  

the boundary point where y and z touch lies in int(x), so z must penetrate into x.  Hence x and z always share interior points, but neither can have x⊂z.  The only RCC‑8 relations left are those where z overlaps or is inside x:

  • Twizzlump(x,z)      (partial overlap)  
  • Narpulate(x,z)     (z is a tangential proper part of x)  
  • Zindlequack(x,z)   (z is a non‑tangential proper part of x)  

### Answer:  
Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
