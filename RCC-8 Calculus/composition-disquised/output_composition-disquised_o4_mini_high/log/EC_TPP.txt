PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The eight relations here are exactly the RCC‐8 relations in disguise:

  Blorpticate = DC  
  Snarfloon    = EC  
  Twizzlump    = PO  
  Glimberish   = TPP  
  Crindlewop   = NTPP  
  Narpulate    = TPP⁻¹  
  Zindlequack  = NTPP⁻¹  
  Frooblenap   = EQ  

We are given  
  EC(x,y)  (Snarfloon)  
  TPP(y,z) (Glimberish)  

Since y is a proper part of z, any point where x “just touches” y must lie in the closure of y, which in turn lies in the closure of z.  Hence x cannot be DC from z.  On the other hand, depending on whether x pokes into the interior of z or merely touches its boundary (and whether x stays entirely inside z or partly outside), the only possibilities for x–z are

  EC(x,z)      Snarfloon  
  PO(x,z)      Twizzlump  
  TPP(x,z)     Glimberish  
  NTPP(x,z)    Crindlewop  

### Answer:  
Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z) or Crindlewop(x,z).
