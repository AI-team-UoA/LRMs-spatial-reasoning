PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since Frooblenap(x,y) makes x and y identical, any y–z relation carries over to x–z.  In particular, from Narpulate(y,z) we get  

   Narpulate(x,z)  

(or equivalently Glimberish(z,x)).  

### Answer: Narpulate(x,z)
