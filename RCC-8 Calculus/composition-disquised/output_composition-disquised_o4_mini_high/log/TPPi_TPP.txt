PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Narpulate(x,y) (i.e. y is a tangential proper part of x) and Glimberish(y,z) (i.e. y is a tangential proper part of z), x and z must overlap (they share y) but neither totally avoids nor totally contains the other except in the tangential or equal cases.  One checks that the only RCC‑8 relations consistent with both constraints are

  • Twizzlump(x,z)   (partial overlap PO)  
  • Glimberish(x,z)  (x TPP z)  
  • Narpulate(x,z)   (x TPP⁻¹ z)  
  • Frooblenap(x,z)  (x EQ z)  

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Frooblenap(x,z)
