PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what each relation means:

- Twizzlump(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- Snarfloon(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

So we know that x and y share some spatial parts (they overlap), and y and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.

Let's figure out what's possible for the relationship between x and z.

1. Could Blorpticate(x,z) be possible? This would mean x and z are disconnected. This seems possible - x could overlap with y in a region that's completely separate from where y touches z.

2. Could Snarfloon(x,z) be possible? This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This seems possible if x extends to the boundary of y that touches z.

3. Could Twizzlump(x,z) be possible? This would mean x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This doesn't seem immediately possible since y and z don't share interior parts, and x only shares parts with y, not directly with z. But let's think more...

   Actually, I think this is possible in certain cases. If x extends beyond y in a way that it also overlaps with z, then Twizzlump(x,z) could hold.

4. Could Glimberish(x,z) be possible? This would mean x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This seems possible if the part of x that overlaps with y is entirely within z, and that part touches z's boundary (which would be where y and z touch).

5. Could Crindlewop(x,z) be possible? This would mean x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems possible if x is entirely within both y and z, and doesn't extend to their boundaries.

6. Could Narpulate(x,z) be possible? This would mean z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This seems possible if z is entirely within the region where x and y overlap, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. Could Zindlequack(x,z) be possible? This would mean z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This seems possible if z is entirely within the region where x and y overlap, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. Could Frooblenap(x,z) be possible? This would mean x and z are coincident (the same). This doesn't seem possible because if x and z were the same, then given Twizzlump(x,y), we would have Twizzlump(z,y), which contradicts Snarfloon(y,z).

Wait, I need to reconsider some of these. The relations are supposed to be pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive, so every pair of regions must satisfy exactly one of these relations.

Let's be more systematic:

If Twizzlump(x,y), then x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
If Snarfloon(y,z), then y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

I need to think about each possible configuration and determine which relation between x and z is possible.

Actually, let me step back and make sure I correctly understand the relations:

1. Blorpticate(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they don't share any parts and don't touch).
2. Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
3. Twizzlump(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other (they properly overlap).
4. Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. Crindlewop(x,y): x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary (x is a proper part in the interior of y).
6. Narpulate(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary (same as Glimberish(y,x)).
7. Zindlequack(x,y): y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary (same as Crindlewop(y,x)).
8. Frooblenap(x,y): x and y are coincident (they're identical).

Ok, that seems right.

Let's reason about the possible relations between x and z given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z).

1. Blorpticate(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x only overlaps with parts of y that don't touch z.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible if x extends to the exact part of y's boundary that touches z.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. I previously thought this might be possible, but I need to reconsider. Since y and z don't share interior parts (they only touch at a boundary), and x only shares parts with y (not directly with z), it doesn't seem possible for x and z to properly overlap. 

   However, there's a counterexample: Imagine x is a large region that properly overlaps with y, and some part of x extends beyond y and properly overlaps with z as well. In this case, Twizzlump(x,z) would hold. But wait, this contradicts Snarfloon(y,z) because if x overlaps with both y and z, then y and z must also overlap. So Twizzlump(x,z) is not possible.

   Hmm, I'm going to reconsider more. Actually, I think the issue is that I'm too specific with my understanding of Snarfloon. Snarfloon means two objects just touch at the boundary, so I can image regions like this

   ```
   x: xxxx
      xxxx
      xxxx
   y:    yyyy
        yyyy
        yyyy
   z:        zzzz
             zzzz
             zzzz
   ```

   Here, x properly overlaps with y (Twizzlump(x,y)), and y just touches z at the boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)), but x and z are completely disconnected (Blorpticate(x,z)).

   Alternatively, I can imagine:

   ```
   x: xxxx
      xxxx
      xxxx
   y:    yyyy
        yyyy
        yyyy
   z:      zzzz
           zzzz
           zzzz
   ```

   Here, x properly overlaps with y (Twizzlump(x,y)), y just touches z at the boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)), and x just touches z at the boundary too (Snarfloon(x,z)).

   But I can also imagine:

   ```
   x: xxxxxxx
      xxxxxxx
      xxxxxxx
   y:    yyyy
        yyyy
        yyyy
   z:      zzzz
           zzzz
           zzzz
   ```

   In this case, x properly overlaps with both y and z, so Twizzlump(x,y) and Twizzlump(x,z) hold, and y just touches z at the boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)).

   Ok, so Twizzlump(x,z) is possible.

4. Glimberish(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, x would have to be entirely contained within z. But we know that x shares parts with y, and y only touches z at a boundary. If x is part of z, then the part of x that overlaps with y would have to be at the boundary of z (where y and z touch). But then x and y couldn't properly overlap, which contradicts Twizzlump(x,y). So Glimberish(x,z) is not possible.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to Glimberish(x,z), this would require x to be entirely contained within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(x,y) given that y only touches z at a boundary. So Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

6. Narpulate(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely contained within x, and some part of z touches the boundary of x. Given Snarfloon(y,z), z touches y at a boundary. If z is part of x, then x must extend beyond y in a way that completely contains z. This seems possible.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to Narpulate(x,z), this requires z to be completely contained within x. But unlike Narpulate(x,z), z doesn't touch x's boundary. This might be possible if x extends well beyond both y and z.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): This means x and z are identical. But we know Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), so x and z can't be identical. So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

Let me rethink this again. Actually, I think it's easier to use a specific model for Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), and then see what's possible for the relationship between x and z.

Let's say y is a circular region, z is another circular region that touches y at a single point (that's Snarfloon(y,z)), and x is a circular region that properly overlaps with y (that's Twizzlump(x,y)).

Depending on where exactly x is positioned, several relations between x and z are possible:

1. If x doesn't extend to the point where y and z touch, then x and z are disconnected: Blorpticate(x,z).
2. If x extends exactly to the point where y and z touch, then x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap: Snarfloon(x,z).
3. If x extends beyond y and also overlaps with z, then x and z properly overlap: Twizzlump(x,z).
4. If x extends beyond y and completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x: Narpulate(x,z).
5. If x extends far beyond y and completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x: Zindlequack(x,z).

The remaining relations (Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), and Frooblenap(x,z)) are not possible given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z).

So the possible relations between x and z are: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), and Zindlequack(x,z).

But let me double-check the relations Narpulate(x,z) and Zindlequack(x,z), because I'm not fully confident.

For Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and to touch x's boundary. Given Snarfloon(y,z), z touches y at a boundary. If z is completely contained within x, and x extends beyond y, then z could be part of x and still touch x's boundary. So I think Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I have another problem: can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (Zindlequack(x,z))? If z touches y's boundary (due to Snarfloon(y,z)), and x overlaps with y but doesn't completely contain y, then there's no way for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. So I think Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reason through this more systematically...

Given Snarfloon(y,z), regions y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
Given Twizzlump(x,y), regions x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

We need to determine which of the eight relations could possibly hold between x and z.

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x overlaps with parts of y that don't touch z.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible if x extends to the exact part of y's boundary that touches z.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x extends beyond y and overlaps with z.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, x would have to be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary. But we know Twizzlump(x,y), so x overlaps with y but isn't part of y. And given Snarfloon(y,z), y only touches z at a boundary. If x is part of z, then the part of x that overlaps with y would have to be at the boundary of z (where y and z touch). But that would contradict Twizzlump(x,y), which says that x and y properly overlap, not just touch at a boundary. So Glimberish(x,z) is not possible.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to Glimberish(x,z), this would require x to be entirely contained within z, which contradicts Twizzlump(x,y) given that y only touches z at a boundary. So Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

6. Narpulate(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This would mean z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Given Snarfloon(y,z), z touches y at a boundary. If z is completely contained within x, then x must extend beyond both y and z in a way that completely contains z. This seems possible, but I'm not fully confident.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This would mean z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given Snarfloon(y,z), z touches y at a boundary. If z is completely contained within x, then x must extend beyond both y and z in a way that completely contains z, and z must not touch the boundary of x. This seems potentially possible, though it's hard to visualize.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are identical. But we know Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), so x and z can't be identical. So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

Let's just try to explicitly construct configurations for the cases I'm less certain about.

Narpulate(x,z): We need z to be a tangential proper part of x (contained in x and touching x's boundary). Here's a setup: Imagine a region y. There's a small region z that touches y at a boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)). Now imagine a region x that properly overlaps with y (Twizzlump(x,y)) and completely contains z. For z to be a tangential proper part of x, it needs to touch x's boundary. One way this could happen is if the point where y and z touch is also on the boundary of x. But if that point is on the boundary of x, then x doesn't properly overlap with y at that point, it just touches y at that point. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to visualize a specific configuration. Imagine y and z as two circles that touch at a single point. Now imagine x as a larger region that properly overlaps with y (covering, say, half of y) and also completely contains z. For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z needs to touch the boundary of x. This could happen if the point where y and z touch is also on the boundary of x. But then x wouldn't properly overlap with y at that point, it would just touch y at that point. However, x could still properly overlap with y elsewhere, so Twizzlump(x,y) would still hold.

So it seems Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

Zindlequack(x,z): We need z to be a non-tangential proper part of x (contained in x and not touching x's boundary). Using the same setup as before: y and z are two circles that touch at a single point, and x is a larger region that properly overlaps with y and completely contains z. For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must not touch the boundary of x. This means the point where y and z touch can't be on the boundary of x. But given that y and z touch at a point, and x properly overlaps with y, it seems like the point where y and z touch would have to be either inside x or on the boundary of x. If it's inside x, then x properly overlaps with y at that point. If it's on the boundary of x, then x touches y at that point. 

Actually, let me think again about the configurations more carefully, because this is getting confusing. We know Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z).

For Twizzlump(x,y), x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
For Snarfloon(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

Now, for Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and touch x's boundary.
For Zindlequack(x,z), we need z to be part of x but not touch x's boundary.

I don't think I'd been visualizing y, z, and their relation correctly. The issue is this: given Snarfloon(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary. That means there's at least one point that belongs to both the boundary of y and the boundary of z. Let's call this point p.

Now, for Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and touch x's boundary. Since z touches y at point p, and z is part of x, then x must include point p. But is point p on the boundary of x or in the interior of x? If it's on the boundary of x, then x touches y at point p, which seems to contradict Twizzlump(x,y) (which requires x and y to properly overlap, not just touch). If it's in the interior of x, then x properly overlaps with y at point p, but then the boundary of z that touches y would be in the interior of x, so z wouldn't touch the boundary of x.

This makes me think Narpulate(x,z) is not possible.

For Zindlequack(x,z), we need z to be part of x but not touch x's boundary. The same reasoning applies: if z touches y at point p, and z is part of x, then x must include point p. But then, the boundary of z that touches y would be in the interior of x, which means z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This seems to satisfy Zindlequack(x,z). However, we still have the issue of whether x touches y or properly overlaps with y at point p. If x touches y at point p, this contradicts Twizzlump(x,y). If x properly overlaps with y at point p, this contradicts Snarfloon(y,z) (which says y and z only touch at a boundary).

This reasoning seems to suggest that neither Narpulate(x,z) nor Zindlequack(x,z) is possible.

But actually, I'm making a mistake. The fact that y and z touch at a boundary doesn't mean there's a point p that belongs to both the boundary of y and the boundary of z. It means there's a point p that belongs to the boundary of y and the boundary of z. But this point p doesn't have to be the same specific point on both boundaries. It just means the boundaries touch.

Let me re-frame. Snarfloon(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. So there's at least one point p such that p is on the boundary of y and p is on the boundary of z. Twizzlump(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. So there's some region that is part of both x and y.

For Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and touch x's boundary. If z is part of x, then the point p (where y and z touch) must be part of x. But is p on the boundary of x or in the interior of x? If p is on the boundary of x, then x touches y at p, which doesn't necessarily contradict Twizzlump(x,y) as long as x and y also share other parts. If p is in the interior of x, then x properly overlaps with y at p, but then the boundary of z that touches y would be in the interior of x, so z wouldn't touch the boundary of x.

Actually, the more I think about it, I realize that I need to be more careful with the definitions. Let's be clear: Twizzlump(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This means there's some region that is part of both x and y, and there's some part of x that's not part of y, and some part of y that's not part of x.

Snarfloon(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This means there's at least one point that is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z, but there's no point that is in the interior of both y and z.

Now, let's think about each possible relation between x and z.

For Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and touch x's boundary. Given Snarfloon(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary. Let's call this point p. If z is part of x, then p must be part of x. But is p on the boundary of x or in the interior of x? If p is on the boundary of x, then z touches the boundary of x at p, which is consistent with Narpulate(x,z). But we also need to check if this is consistent with Twizzlump(x,y). If p is on the boundary of x, then x and y either touch at p or properly overlap at p. If they properly overlap at p, then p is in the interior of both x and y, which contradicts the fact that p is on the boundary of y. If they touch at p, then p is on the boundary of both x and y, which is consistent with Twizzlump(x,y) as long as x and y also share other parts.

So it seems Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

For Zindlequack(x,z), we need z to be part of x but not touch x's boundary. If z is part of x, then the point p (where y and z touch) must be part of x. But for z to not touch the boundary of x, p must be in the interior of x. But if p is in the interior of x, then p can't be on the boundary of y (because p is a point where y and z touch, so p is on the boundary of both y and z). This contradicts Snarfloon(y,z).

So it seems Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, there's another complication I'm not handling correctly: the point p where y and z touch. For Snarfloon(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary. Let's say there's a point p on the boundary of both y and z. For Twizzlump(x,y), x and y share a spatial part. This means there's some region that's part of both x and y.

For Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and touch x's boundary. If z is part of x, then the point p (where y and z touch) must be part of both x and z. But then p is also part of both x and y, which means p is in the region where x and y overlap. But Snarfloon(y,z) says p is on the boundary of y, so p can't be in the interior of y. But if p is on the boundary of y and also part of x, then x and y don't properly overlap at p, they touch at p. This contradicts the fact that p is in the region where x and y overlap.

I think I'm getting confused because I'm conflating "properly overlap" with "share a spatial part". Let me clarify again: 

- Twizzlump(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. They properly overlap.
- Snarfloon(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

For two regions to properly overlap, they must share some interior points, not just boundary points. So if x and y properly overlap, there must be some points that are in the interior of both x and y.

Now, for Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and touch x's boundary. Given Snarfloon(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary point p. If z is part of x, then p must be part of both x and z. But p is on the boundary of z, and if z is part of x, then p is either on the boundary of x or in the interior of x. If p is on the boundary of x, then z touches the boundary of x at p, which is consistent with Narpulate(x,z). But we also need to check if this is consistent with Twizzlump(x,y). If p is on the boundary of x, then x and y either touch at p or properly overlap at p. If they properly overlap at p, then p is in the interior of both x and y, which contradicts the fact that p is on the boundary of y. If they touch at p, then p is on the boundary of both x and y, which might seem to contradict Twizzlump(x,y). But actually, Twizzlump(x,y) only requires that x and y share some spatial part, not that they share all parts. So as long as x and y properly overlap somewhere else, Twizzlump(x,y) is satisfied.

So it seems Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I need to be even more careful with the definition of Twizzlump. Here's what I know:

- Twizzlump(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. They properly overlap.
- Snarfloon(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

Now, let's think about each possible relation between x and z.

OK, I think I still haven't fully visualized this. Let me try harder.

Let's say y is a circle, and z is another circle that touches y at a single point. That gives us Snarfloon(y,z).

For Twizzlump(x,y), x must properly overlap with y. This means there's a region that's part of both x and y, and there's some part of x that's not part of y, and some part of y that's not part of x. Let's say x is another circle that partially overlaps with y, but not at the point where y touches z. So x and y share some interior points, but the point where y touches z is not one of them.

Now, for the relationship between x and z, several possibilities emerge:

1. If x doesn't extend to the point where y and z touch, then x and z are disconnected: Blorpticate(x,z).
2. If x extends exactly to the point where y and z touch, then x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap: Snarfloon(x,z).
3. If x extends beyond y and also overlaps with z, then x and z properly overlap: Twizzlump(x,z).

OK, now what about Narpulate(x,z)?

For Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and touch x's boundary. If z is completely contained within x, and the point where y and z touch is also on the boundary of x, then z would be a tangential proper part of x. But this would mean that x and y touch at that point, which might seem to contradict Twizzlump(x,y). 

But actually, that's not necessarily a contradiction. Twizzlump(x,y) only requires that x and y share some spatial part, not that they share all parts. So as long as x and y properly overlap somewhere else, Twizzlump(x,y) is satisfied. So I think Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

What about Zindlequack(x,z)?

For Zindlequack(x,z), we need z to be part of x but not touch x's boundary. If z is completely contained within x, and the point where y and z touch is in the interior of x, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. But that means the point where y and z touch is in the interior of x. This point is on the boundary of both y and z. If it's in the interior of x, then x properly overlaps with y at that point. But that point is on the boundary of y, so it can't be in the interior of y, which contradicts the notion of proper overlap. So I think Zindlequack(x,z) is not possible.

Alright, let's summarize:

The possible relations between x and z, given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), are:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Narpulate(x,z)

The remaining relations (Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z), and Frooblenap(x,z)) are not possible.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning about Narpulate(x,z).

For Narpulate(x,z), we need z to be part of x and touch x's boundary. Given Snarfloon(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary. Let's call this point p. If z is part of x, then p must be part of both x and z. Since p is on the boundary of z, it's either on the boundary of x or in the interior of x. If p is on the boundary of x, then z touches the boundary of x at p, which is consistent with Narpulate(x,z).

But we also need to check if this is consistent with Twizzlump(x,y). If p is on the boundary of x, then x and y either touch at p or properly overlap at p. If they properly overlap at p, then p is in the interior of both x and y, which contradicts the fact that p is on the boundary of y (given Snarfloon(y,z)). If they touch at p, then p is on the boundary of both x and y, which might seem to contradict Twizzlump(x,y), which requires proper overlap.

But here's the thing: Twizzlump(x,y) requires that x and y share some spatial part, but it doesn't require that they share all parts. So as long as x and y properly overlap somewhere else, Twizzlump(x,y) is satisfied, even if they just touch at point p.

So I think Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me try to explicitly draw a configuration.

Consider the following configuration (not drawn to scale):

```
   xxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
         yyzzzzzz
         yyzzzzzz
         yyzzzzzz
```

Here, x is the region on the left, y is the region in the middle, and z is the region on the right. x and y properly overlap (Twizzlump(x,y)), and y and z touch at a boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)).

In this configuration, x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap (Snarfloon(x,z)).

Now, let's modify it:

```
   xxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
         yyzzzzzz
   xxxxxxyyzzzzzz
   xxxxxxyyzzzzzz
```

Here, x extends below and properly overlaps with z. So in this configuration, x and z properly overlap (Twizzlump(x,z)).

Let's try another configuration:

```
   xxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
         yy
   xxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxx
```

Here, y and z touch at a boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)), but x and z are disconnected (Blorpticate(x,z)).

Now let's try to draw a configuration for Narpulate(x,z):

```
   xxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyy
         yyzzzzzz
   xxxxxxxxxzzzzzz
   xxxxxxxxxzzzzzz
```

Here, z is completely contained within x, and the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of x. So z is a tangential proper part of x (Narpulate(x,z)).

This confirms my analysis: the possible relations between x and z, given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), are Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), and Narpulate(x,z).

Actually, I'm forgetting to check one thing for Narpulate(x,z). For Narpulate(x,z), z must be part of x and must touch x's boundary. In the configuration I drew, z is indeed part of x, and z touches the boundary of x at the same point where it touches y. So Narpulate(x,z) is possible.

Let me also try to draw a configuration for Zindlequack(x,z) to confirm that it's not possible.

For Zindlequack(x,z), z must be part of x but must not touch x's boundary. Given Snarfloon(y,z), z touches y at a boundary point p. If z is part of x, then p must be part of both x and z. But p is on the boundary of z, so if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then p must be in the interior of x. But if p is in the interior of x, then x properly overlaps with y at p. But p is on the boundary of y, so it can't be in the interior of y, which contradicts the notion of proper overlap.

Actually, what if x is much larger and completely contains both y and z? 

```
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyy
   xxxxxxyyzzzzzzzzxx
   xxxxxxyyzzzzzzzzxx
   xxxxxxyyzzzzzzzzxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

In this configuration, x completely contains both y and z, y and z touch at a boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)), and z is completely in the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x (Zindlequack(x,z)).

So it seems Zindlequack(x,z) is also possible.

Let me rethink the other relations too. For Glimberish(x,z), x must be part of z and touch z's boundary. But given Twizzlump(x,y), x properly overlaps with y, so x can't be completely contained within z. So Glimberish(x,z) is not possible.

For Crindlewop(x,z), x must be part of z but not touch z's boundary. Again, given Twizzlump(x,y), x properly overlaps with y, so x can't be completely contained within z. So Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

For Frooblenap(x,z), x and z must be identical. But given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), x and z can't be identical. So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

Let's summarize once more:

The possible relations between x and z, given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), are:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Narpulate(x,z)
5. Zindlequack(x,z)

So the final answer is Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), and Zindlequack(x,z).

Actually, let me double check Crindlewop.

For Crindlewop(x,z), x must be part of z but not touch z's boundary. Given Twizzlump(x,y), x properly overlaps with y. If x is part of z, then the part of x that overlaps with y must also be part of z. But given Snarfloon(y,z), y and z only touch at a boundary and don't share any interior parts. So the part of x that overlaps with y can't be part of z. This contradicts our assumption that x is part of z. So Crindlewop(x,z) is not possible.

For Glimberish(x,z), x must be part of z and touch z's boundary. The same reasoning applies as for Crindlewop(x,z). Given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), x can't be part of z. So Glimberish(x,z) is not possible.

For Frooblenap(x,z), x and z must be identical. But given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), x and z can't be identical. So Frooblenap(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I'm going in circles. I should stop and just make a final decision. 

The possible relations between x and z, given Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z), are:
1. Blorpticate(x,z)
2. Snarfloon(x,z)
3. Twizzlump(x,z)
4. Narpulate(x,z)
5. Zindlequack(x,z)

The remaining relations (Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), and Frooblenap(x,z)) are not possible.

So the answer is: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what configurations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

First, let's review the relationships we know:
- Twizzlump(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other (they properly overlap)
- Snarfloon(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): This is possible if x overlaps with parts of y that are away from where y touches z. The regions x and z would be completely disconnected.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): This is possible if x extends exactly to the boundary point where y and z touch. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary but not overlap.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): This is possible if x extends beyond y and also overlaps with part of z. In this configuration, x and z would share some spatial part, but neither would be contained in the other.

4. Narpulate(x,z): This is possible if x completely contains z and z touches the boundary of x. This can happen if x extends beyond both y and z, completely containing z, with z touching x's boundary.

5. Zindlequack(x,z): This is possible if z is completely contained within the interior of x, not touching x's boundary. This can happen if x is much larger and completely contains both the region where y and z touch.

The remaining relations (Glimberish, Crindlewop, and Frooblenap) are not possible because they would contradict our given conditions.
