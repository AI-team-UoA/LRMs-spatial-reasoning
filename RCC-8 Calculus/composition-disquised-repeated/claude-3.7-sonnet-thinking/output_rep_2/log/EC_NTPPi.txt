PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's identify what information we're given:

1. Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. Zindlequack(y,z): This is the same as Crindlewop(z,y), which means z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- x and y touch at a boundary
- z is a part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary

Let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary, z is completely in the interior of y. 

Since x touches y only at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is completely in the interior of y, it means x and z don't overlap at all. In fact, they are separated by at least some part of y's interior.

So what would be the relationship between x and z?

Since x and z don't share any parts and are disconnected (separated by y's interior), the relationship would be Blorpticate(x,z).

Wait, let me check this more carefully. Blorpticate means "disconnected and share no spatial parts", and Snarfloon means "touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts". 

If x and y touch at a boundary (Snarfloon), and z is completely inside y without touching its boundary (Zindlequack), then x and z don't touch. They're separated by at least some part of y's interior. So they should be disconnected.

So I believe the answer is:

Blorpticate(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check by considering all the possible relations:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This seems possible based on our reasoning.
2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z can't touch.
3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since z is completely inside y and x doesn't share interior parts with y, x and z can't share parts.
4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This would require x to be inside z, but x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary), so it can't be inside z which is inside y.
5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Similarly, this isn't possible because x is outside of y.
6. Narpulate(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This would require z to be inside x, but z is inside y, and x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary), so z can't be inside x.
7. Zindlequack(x,z): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Similarly, this isn't possible because z is inside y.
8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This isn't possible because x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary) and z is inside y.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

Wait, I just realized an issue with my reasoning. I've been assuming that if Snarfloon(x,y), then x is "outside" of y. But this isn't necessarily the case. Snarfloon just means they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. 

Let me reconsider more carefully:

1. Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. Zindlequack(y,z): z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

If x and y touch at a boundary, it could be that:
- x is "outside" of y
- x is a part of y that touches y's boundary (like a hole in y)
- y is a part of x that touches x's boundary
- or some other configuration where they touch at a boundary

And z is a part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary, meaning z is in the "interior" of y.

In scenario 1 (x is outside of y), x and z would be disconnected, so Blorpticate(x,z).
In scenario 2 (x is like a hole in y), x and z could potentially touch or even overlap, depending on the exact configuration.
In scenario 3 (y is part of x), z would be a part of y which is a part of x, so z would be a part of x.

Let me analyze these scenarios more systematically:

Scenario 1: x is outside of y (like two adjacent pieces)
If x is outside of y and they only touch at a boundary, and z is completely inside y, then x and z are disconnected. So Blorpticate(x,z).

Scenario 2: x is a "hole" in y (like a donut and its hole)
If x is a hole in y, then x and y touch at a boundary (Snarfloon). If z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then z must be in the "donut" part and not in the hole. So x and z would be disconnected, thus Blorpticate(x,z).

Scenario 3: y is a part of x that touches x's boundary
If y is a part of x, and z is a part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary, then z is a part of x. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, z wouldn't touch x's boundary either. So Crindlewop(z,x) or equivalently Zindlequack(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more precise about Scenario 3. If y is a part of x, then Glimberish(y,x) or Crindlewop(y,x), not Snarfloon(x,y). So this scenario doesn't apply to our problem.

Hmm, I just realized there's another way to interpret Snarfloon. It could mean that x and y are adjacent but don't overlap in their interiors, similar to how two adjacent states on a map would be. In this case, they share a boundary, but not interior parts.

OK, I think I've been a bit imprecise. Let me revisit the definitions:

Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
Zindlequack(y,z): z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So, x and y touch at a boundary, which means they are not completely disconnected. But they don't share any interior parts, which means they don't overlap (except possibly at the boundary).

Now, z is part of y, so z is inside y. But z doesn't touch y's boundary, which means it's in the strict interior of y.

Given these, x and z must be disconnected, because x only touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly in the interior of y and doesn't touch the boundary. So Blorpticate(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Just to be thorough, let me check the definitions of the other relations:

- Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Given that z is in the strict interior of y, and x doesn't share any interior parts with y, x and z can't share any parts.
- Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This isn't possible because x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary), and z is in the strict interior of y.
- Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Similarly, this isn't possible.
- Narpulate(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This would require z to be inside x, but z is in the strict interior of y, and x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary), so z can't be inside x.
- Zindlequack(x,z): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Similarly, this isn't possible.
- Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This isn't possible because x is outside of y and z is inside y.

OK, now I think I can confidently state that the only possible relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

But wait, I might have misunderstood something. Let me reconsider the definitions of Snarfloon and Zindlequack:

Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
Zindlequack(y,z): z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

If x and y touch at a boundary, it means they have some common points on their boundaries. But they don't share any interior points.

If z is part of y, it means all of z is inside y. But z doesn't touch y's boundary, so it's in the strict interior of y.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. If x touches y only at the boundary, and z is in the strict interior of y, then x and z can't overlap or touch. So they must be disconnected. Hence, Blorpticate(x,z).

Let me double check that I haven't missed anything. The key point is that, if x touches y only at the boundary, and z is in the strict interior of y, then x and z are spatially separated. They can't overlap or touch, and neither can be a part of the other. So the only possible relationship is Blorpticate(x,z).

Hm wait, let me try to think about a specific example to make sure I'm reasoning correctly. 

Let's consider y to be a solid circle. 

If x is the region outside the circle, and they touch at the boundary (Snarfloon(x,y)), and z is a smaller circle completely inside y and not touching the boundary of y (Zindlequack(y,z)), then x and z are clearly disconnected and don't share any parts. So Blorpticate(x,z).

Now, let's consider another example. If y is a circular annulus (a ring), x is the interior of the inner circle (the "hole" in the ring), and z is a small circle inside the annular region of y, then again x and z are disconnected and don't share any parts. So Blorpticate(x,z).

Actually, wait, in the second example, I'm not sure if Snarfloon(x,y) holds. Let me double-check. If x is the interior of the inner circle and y is the ring, then they touch at the boundary of the inner circle. They don't share any interior parts, because the interior of x is the inside of the inner circle, and the interior of y is the annular region. So indeed, Snarfloon(x,y) holds.

The key observation is that if Snarfloon(x,y), then x and y only touch at a boundary. And if Zindlequack(y,z), then z is in the strict interior of y. Given these, x and z must be disconnected, because z is in the interior of y, and x only touches y at the boundary, not in the interior.

So, the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

Actually, hold on. Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary. This means they share some points on their boundaries. But Snarfloon doesn't specify which boundary points they share. It could be all of y's boundary, or only part of it.

Let's reconsider. If Snarfloon(x,y), then x and y touch at a boundary. This means they share some points on their boundaries. But they don't share any interior points.

If Zindlequack(y,z), then z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary. This means z is in the strict interior of y.

Now, could x and z be related in any way other than Blorpticate?

Let's go through the possibilities:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. As I've been arguing, this seems to be the only plausible relationship, since z is in the strict interior of y, and x only touches y at the boundary.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This doesn't seem possible. If z is in the strict interior of y, and x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary), then x and z can't touch at a boundary.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This doesn't seem possible either. If z is in the strict interior of y, and x doesn't share any interior parts with y, then x and z can't share any parts.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This would require x to be inside z, which doesn't seem possible given the constraints.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Similarly, this doesn't seem possible.

6. Narpulate(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This would require z to be inside x, but z is in the strict interior of y, and x doesn't share interior parts with y, so z can't be inside x.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Similarly, this doesn't seem possible.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This isn't possible because x doesn't share interior parts with y, and z is in the interior of y.

So, the only plausible relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

Actually, I now realize I have been taking for granted that if Snarfloon(x,y), then x and y are "adjacent" but separate entities. But Snarfloon just says they touch at a boundary and don't share interior parts. It doesn't say anything about x being outside of y or vice versa.

Specifically, I've been assuming that when Snarfloon(x,y), at least some parts of x are outside of y (i.e., disconnected from y). But I should try to be more precise and consider the exact definition of Snarfloon.

The specific definition of Snarfloon(x,y) is that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. So, they share some boundary points, but not any interior points.

Let's consider some cases:

Case 1: x is "outside" of y, and they share a part of their boundaries (like two adjacent states on a map).
In this case, if z is in the strict interior of y, then x and z are disconnected. So Blorpticate(x,z).

Case 2: x is a "hole" in y, and they share all of x's boundary (like a donut and its hole).
In this case, if z is in the strict interior of y, then z is in the "donut" part, not in the hole. So x and z are disconnected, and Blorpticate(x,z).

Case 3: y is a "hole" in x, and they share all of y's boundary.
This doesn't seem possible under the given constraints. If y is a hole in x, then the interior of y is outside of x, not inside it. But Zindlequack(y,z) means z is in the interior of y. So in this case, z would be outside of x, which would make it Blorpticate(x,z).

Case 4: x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts.
This contradicts Snarfloon(x,y), which says they don't share any interior parts.

Case 5: x is a part of y, and they share some boundary points.
This would be Glimberish(x,y), not Snarfloon(x,y).

Case 6: y is a part of x, and they share some boundary points.
This would be Narpulate(x,y), not Snarfloon(x,y).

Case 7: x and y are coincident.
This would be Frooblenap(x,y), not Snarfloon(x,y).

So, in all valid cases where Snarfloon(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z), the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

OK, I think I'm convinced. The only possible relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

Wait, actually, I realize I'm making one more assumption. I've been assuming that if Snarfloon(x,y), then x and y share *some* boundary points, but not necessarily all. And if they don't share all boundary points, then at least some of the interior of y is not adjacent to x.

But what if x and y share *all* of their boundary points? 

For example, consider a solid circle y, and let x be the infinite region outside the circle. Then Snarfloon(x,y), because they touch at the boundary (the circle) but don't share any interior parts. Now, if z is a smaller circle completely inside y, then Zindlequack(y,z). In this case, x and z are disconnected, so Blorpticate(x,z).

OK, I've convinced myself again. The relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

Actually, I think the issue is that I've been thinking too much about Euclidean space. But the problem doesn't specify the space. It just gives a set of spatial relations. 

So, using the definitions provided, if Snarfloon(x,y), then x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. And if Zindlequack(y,z), then z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these, can x and z be related in any way other than Blorpticate?

Let's go through the possibilities once more:

1. Blorpticate(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. As I've been arguing, this seems to be the only plausible relationship, since z is in the strict interior of y, and x only touches y at the boundary.

2. Snarfloon(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This doesn't seem possible. If z is in the strict interior of y, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z can't touch at a boundary.

3. Twizzlump(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This doesn't seem possible either. If z is in the strict interior of y, and x doesn't share any interior parts with y, then x and z can't share any parts.

4. Glimberish(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible given the constraints.

5. Crindlewop(x,z): x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Similarly, this doesn't seem possible.

6. Narpulate(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This doesn't seem possible.

7. Zindlequack(x,z): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Similarly, this doesn't seem possible.

8. Frooblenap(x,z): x and z are coincident. This isn't possible.

So, the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

Actually, I feel like I'm going in circles, but I would like to try another approach. 

From Snarfloon(x,y), we know that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Let's denote the set of points in x as X, and the set of points in y as Y. Then, X ∩ Y = X_boundary ∩ Y_boundary, where X_boundary is the boundary of X, and Y_boundary is the boundary of Y. And X_interior ∩ Y_interior = ∅.

From Zindlequack(y,z), we know that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary. So, Z ⊆ Y, where Z is the set of points in z. And Z ∩ Y_boundary = ∅. This means Z ⊆ Y_interior.

Now, can X and Z have any common points? If they do, then these common points would be in Y as well (since Z ⊆ Y). But X ∩ Y = X_boundary ∩ Y_boundary, which means any common points of X and Y are on the boundary of Y. But Z ∩ Y_boundary = ∅, so Z has no points on the boundary of Y. Therefore, X and Z can't have any common points. So, X ∩ Z = ∅.

This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts, which is the definition of Blorpticate(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

I think this argument is definitive: x and z are disjoint, i.e., Blorpticate(x,z).

OK, let me solve this one more time from scratch, being as rigorous as possible.

We are given:
1. Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. Zindlequack(y,z): z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

From 1, we know that x and y share some boundary points, but don't share any interior points. So, if we denote the interior of x as x° and the interior of y as y°, then x° ∩ y° = ∅. And if we denote the boundary of x as ∂x and the boundary of y as ∂y, then ∂x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅.

From 2, we know that z is a subset of y, but z doesn't touch the boundary of y. So, z ⊆ y and z ∩ ∂y = ∅. This means z ⊆ y°.

Now, let's consider the relationship between x and z. Since z ⊆ y° and x° ∩ y° = ∅, we have z ∩ x° = ∅. Also, since z ∩ ∂y = ∅ and ∂x ∩ y = ∂x ∩ ∂y, we have z ∩ ∂x = ∅.

So, z doesn't intersect with either the interior or the boundary of x, which means z ∩ x = ∅. This corresponds to Blorpticate(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

I'm now very confident that the answer is Blorpticate(x,z).

Oh wait, I missed something. I wrote "∂x ∩ y = ∂x ∩ ∂y". But this isn't necessarily true.

Let me be more careful. From Snarfloon(x,y), we know that x ∩ y = (∂x ∩ ∂y) and x° ∩ y° = ∅. From Zindlequack(y,z), we know that z ⊆ y and z ∩ ∂y = ∅, which means z ⊆ y°.

Now, can x and z have any common points? If they do, then these common points would be in both x and y. But x ∩ y = (∂x ∩ ∂y), so any common points of x and y are in both ∂x and ∂y. But z ∩ ∂y = ∅, so z has no points on the boundary of y. Therefore, z has no points in x ∩ y, which means x and z can't have any common points. So, x ∩ z = ∅.

This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts, which is the definition of Blorpticate(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

Actually, I think the issue I was having is that I'm implicitly assuming x and y are "nice" sets, like the closure of their interiors. But in general, the boundary of x is not the same as the boundary of the interior of x. So I'm being a bit sloppy in my reasoning.

Let me try again, being more precise.

We are given:
1. Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. Zindlequack(y,z): z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

From 1, we know that x and y have some common points, but these common points are not in the interior of either x or y. They are on the boundary of both x and y. In other words, x ∩ y ≠ ∅ but int(x) ∩ int(y) = ∅, where int() denotes the interior.

From 2, we know that z is a subset of y, but z doesn't intersect the boundary of y. In other words, z ⊆ y and z ∩ ∂y = ∅, where ∂ denotes the boundary. This means z ⊆ int(y).

Now, can x and z have any common points? If they do, then these common points would be in both x and y. But the only points in both x and y are in x ∩ y, which is a subset of ∂y. But z ∩ ∂y = ∅, so z has no points in x ∩ y. Therefore, x and z can't have any common points. So, x ∩ z = ∅.

This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts, which is the definition of Blorpticate(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

Ah, wait. I didn't quite get it right. Let me clarify what Snarfloon(x,y) means. It means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. "Touch at a boundary" means they have some common points on their boundaries. So, (∂x ∩ ∂y) ≠ ∅. And "don't share any interior parts" means their interiors are disjoint. So, int(x) ∩ int(y) = ∅.

It's possible that x has some parts on the boundary of y, but not in the interior of y. It's also possible that y has some parts on the boundary of x, but not in the interior of x. And it's also possible that x and y share some boundary points.

Let's denote the boundary of x as ∂x and the boundary of y as ∂y. And let's denote the interior of x as int(x) and the interior of y as int(y).

Then, Snarfloon(x,y) means:
- (∂x ∩ ∂y) ≠ ∅ (they share some boundary points)
- int(x) ∩ int(y) = ∅ (their interiors are disjoint)

And Zindlequack(y,z) means:
- z ⊆ y (z is part of y)
- z ∩ ∂y = ∅ (z doesn't touch y's boundary)

Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, it means z ⊆ int(y).

Now, can x and z have any common points? If they do, then these common points would be in both x and int(y). But int(x) ∩ int(y) = ∅, so these common points can't be in int(x). So, they must be in ∂x. But then they would be in both ∂x and int(y), which seems possible.

OK, OK, not so fast. Let me think again.

- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- Zindlequack(y,z): z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Now let's use some topological properties of boundaries, interiors, and exteriors.

First of all, Snarfloon(x,y) means that x and y have some common points, but these common points are not in the interior of either x or y. They are on the boundaries. In other words, x ∩ y = (∂x ∩ y) = (x ∩ ∂y) = (∂x ∩ ∂y).

Secondly, Zindlequack(y,z) means that z is a subset of y, but z doesn't intersect the boundary of y. In other words, z ⊆ y and z ∩ ∂y = ∅. This means z ⊆ int(y).

Now, can x and z have any common points? If they do, then these common points would be in both x and int(y). But x ∩ y = (∂x ∩ ∂y), which is a subset of ∂y. And int(y) ∩ ∂y = ∅. So, x ∩ int(y) = ∅. This means x and z can't have any common points. So, x ∩ z = ∅.

This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts, which is the definition of Blorpticate(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

OK, wait. I made an error again. If Snarfloon(x,y), then x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This doesn't mean that x ∩ y = (∂x ∩ ∂y). It just means that (∂x ∩ ∂y) ≠ ∅ and int(x) ∩ int(y) = ∅.

In particular, x could have some parts in the exterior of y, and some parts on the boundary of y. And y could have some parts in the exterior of x, and some parts on the boundary of x.

Let's try to use the fact that we have 8 pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive binary spatial relations. 

If Snarfloon(x,y), then x and y don't satisfy any of the other 7 relations. 

In particular, they don't satisfy Blorpticate(x,y), which means they are not disconnected. In other words, x and y share some points: x ∩ y ≠ ∅.

Also, they don't satisfy Twizzlump(x,y), which means they don't share a spatial part with neither being part of the other. So, either they don't share a spatial part, or one is part of the other.

But they share some points, as we just established. So, one must be part of the other. But they don't satisfy Glimberish(x,y), which means it's not the case that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. And they don't satisfy Crindlewop(x,y), which means it's not the case that x is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So, x is not part of y.

Similarly, they don't satisfy Narpulate(x,y) or Zindlequack(x,y), which means y is not part of x.

Finally, they don't satisfy Frooblenap(x,y), which means they are not coincident.

So, Snarfloon(x,y) must mean that x and y share some points, but neither is part of the other. And since they don't satisfy Twizzlump(x,y), the parts they share must be boundary points, not interior parts.

This is consistent with the definition: x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Now, Zindlequack(y,z) means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary. So, z ⊆ int(y).

Now, can x and z have any common points? If they do, then these common points would be in both x and int(y). But we just established that x and y share only boundary points, not interior points. So, x ∩ int(y) = ∅. This means x and z can't have any common points. So, x ∩ z = ∅.

This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts, which is the definition of Blorpticate(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

I think this argument is definitive: x and z are disjoint, i.e., Blorpticate(x,z).

OK, now let me just double check that there is no other possible relationship.

Let's consider the region of space r that is the difference between y and z. So r = y - z. Visually, think of y as a donut (a circle with a hole), and z as a circle inside the donut. Then r is the donut minus the circle, i.e., it's a circle with two holes.

Given the problem constraints, we know:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior points.
- Zindlequack(y,z): z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

From Zindlequack(y,z), we know that z is fully in the interior of y, not touching y's boundary.

From Snarfloon(x,y), we know that x touches y only at the boundary, not sharing any interior points with y.

Since z is in the interior of y, and x touches y only at the boundary, x and z don't share any points and are disconnected. Hence, Blorpticate(x,z).

I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is Blorpticate(x,z).

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given that Snarfloon(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- Snarfloon(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- Zindlequack(y,z): z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary (equivalent to Crindlewop(z,y))

From these relations, I can determine:
- x and y only share boundary points, not interior points
- z is completely within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary at all

Since x only shares boundary points with y, and z is strictly in the interior of y (not touching y's boundary), there's no way for x and z to share any points or to touch. They must be completely disconnected from each other.

This matches the definition of Blorpticate(x,z), which means that x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
