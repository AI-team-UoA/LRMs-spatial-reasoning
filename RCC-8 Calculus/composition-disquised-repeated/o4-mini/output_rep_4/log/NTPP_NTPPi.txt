PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
The pairwise‐disjoint exhaustive relation between x and z can be any of the eight.  In particular, given Crindlewop(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  
• Frooblenap(x,z)
