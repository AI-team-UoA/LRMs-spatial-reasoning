PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- **Snarfloon(x, y)**: x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- **Crindlewop(y, z)**: y is part of z and does not touch z’s boundary.

We analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. **Twizzlump(x, z)**: x and z share a spatial part (e.g., a boundary point or more), but neither is part of the other. This occurs when:
   - x is not entirely contained in z (e.g., x touches y at a point inside z but extends outside z).
   - Example: x and z share a point (from the x-y boundary contact inside z) but x has parts outside z.

2. **Crindlewop(x, z)**: x is part of z and does not touch z’s boundary. This occurs when:
   - x is entirely contained within z (due to y being inside z and x touching y, x may also be inside z).
   - x does not touch z’s boundary.
   - Example: x is a small region entirely inside z, tangent to y, and not touching z’s boundary.

3. **Glimberish(x, z)**: x is part of z and touches z’s boundary. This occurs when:
   - x is entirely contained within z.
   - x touches z’s boundary at some point.
   - Example: x is inside z, tangent to y, and also touches the boundary of z.

These three relations are possible based on the configuration of x, y, and z. Other relations are excluded:
- **Blorpticate(x, z)**: Impossible because x and z share at least the boundary point where x touches y (which is inside z).
- **Snarfloon(x, z)**: Impossible because the shared point (from x-y contact) is interior to z, not on z’s boundary.
- **Narpulate(x, z) or Zindlequack(x, z)**: Require z to be part of x, but z contains y and possibly x, so z cannot be part of x.
- **Frooblenap(x, z)**: Requires x and z to be coincident, which is not implied.

Thus, the possible relations are Twizzlump, Crindlewop, and Glimberish.

### Answer:
Twizzlump(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Glimberish(x,z)
