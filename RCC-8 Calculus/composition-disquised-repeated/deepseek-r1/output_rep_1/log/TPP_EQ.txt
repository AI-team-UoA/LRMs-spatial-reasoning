PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- Glimberish(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y’s boundary.
- Frooblenap(y,z) means y and z are coincident (spatially identical).

Since y and z are coincident, any spatial property of y applies equally to z. Therefore:
- x being part of y implies x is part of z.
- x touching y’s boundary implies x touches z’s boundary.

Thus, the relation between x and z satisfies the definition of Glimberish(x,z). No other relation is possible because:
- The relations are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
- x is part of z but not coincident with z (since x is a proper part of y, and y is coincident with z, x cannot be the whole of z).
- Other relations like Blorpticate (disconnected), Snarfloon (touch without sharing interior), Twizzlump (share parts without part-whole), etc., do not apply given the part-whole relationship and boundary touching.

Hence, the only possible relationship is Glimberish(x,z).
