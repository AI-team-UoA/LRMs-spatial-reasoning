PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z), which means:
- Glimberish(x,y): x is part of y and x touches y's boundary.
- Narpulate(y,z) is equivalent to Glimberish(z,y): z is part of y and z touches y's boundary.

Both x and z are parts of y and both touch y's boundary. The possible relationships between x and z depend on their spatial configurations relative to each other. The relations Crindlewop and Zindlequack are impossible because they would require one to be part of the other without touching its boundary, but the boundary touching with y forces any part-of relationship between x and z to include boundary touching.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **Frooblenap(x,z)**: If x and z are coincident (identical).
- **Glimberish(x,z)**: If x is part of z and x touches z's boundary.
- **Narpulate(x,z)**: Equivalent to Glimberish(z,x), meaning z is part of x and z touches x's boundary.
- **Twizzlump(x,z)**: If x and z share a spatial part but neither is part of the other.
- **Snarfloon(x,z)**: If x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- **Blorpticate(x,z)**: If x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Thus, all relations except Crindlewop and Zindlequack are possible.

### Answer:
Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, Narpulate, Frooblenap
