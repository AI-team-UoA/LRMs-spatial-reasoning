PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Frooblenap(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy the same spatial region. Given Blorpticate(y,z), y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. Since x and y are coincident, the spatial relation between x and any other object must be identical to the relation between y and that object. Therefore, Blorpticate(y,z) implies that x and z must also be disconnected and share no spatial parts, so Blorpticate(x,z) is the only possible relationship.
