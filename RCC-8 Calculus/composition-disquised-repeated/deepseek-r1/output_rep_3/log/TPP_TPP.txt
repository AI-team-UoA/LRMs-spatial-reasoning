PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Glimberish(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z):
- Glimberish(x,y) means x is part of y and x touches y's boundary.
- Glimberish(y,z) means y is part of z and y touches z's boundary.

Since x is part of y and y is part of z, x must be part of z by transitivity of parthood. The possible relations between x and z depend on whether x touches z's boundary:
- If x touches z's boundary, then Glimberish(x,z) holds.
- If x does not touch z's boundary, then Crindlewop(x,z) holds.

Both scenarios are possible, depending on the spatial configuration:
- Example where Glimberish(x,z) holds: If x is located at a point where y's boundary coincides with z's boundary (e.g., x is on the shared boundary point), then x touches z's boundary.
- Example where Crindlewop(x,z) holds: If x touches y's boundary at a point interior to z (not on z's boundary), then x does not touch z's boundary.

No other relations are possible, as:
- Blorpticate, Snarfloon, and Twizzlump are excluded because x and z share interior parts (since x is part of z).
- Narpulate and Zindlequack are excluded because z cannot be part of x (as x is a proper part of z).
- Frooblenap is excluded because x and z are not coincident (x is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of z).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are Glimberish or Crindlewop.

### Answer:  
Glimberish or Crindlewop
