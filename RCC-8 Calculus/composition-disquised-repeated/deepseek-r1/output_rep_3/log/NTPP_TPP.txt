PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Crindlewop(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z):
- Crindlewop(x,y) means x is part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- Glimberish(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

By transitivity of parthood, x is part of z. Since x does not touch y's boundary and is entirely interior to y, and y touches z's boundary but does not necessarily cover all of it, x remains interior to y and thus does not touch z's boundary. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is Crindlewop(x,z), as x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

No other relations are possible:
- Blorpticate: x and z are connected (x is part of z).
- Snarfloon: they share interior parts (x is part of z).
- Twizzlump: x is part of z, so it violates "neither is part of the other".
- Glimberish: requires x to touch z's boundary, but x does not.
- Narpulate: same as Glimberish(z,x), which would require z to be part of x, impossible.
- Zindlequack: same as Crindlewop(z,x), which would require z to be part of x, impossible.
- Frooblenap: x and z are not coincident (x is a proper part of z).
