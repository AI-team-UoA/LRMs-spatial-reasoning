PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The relations are derived from the given conditions:  
- Narpulate(x,y) implies Glimberish(y,x), meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.  
- Narpulate(y,z) implies Glimberish(z,y), meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary.  

From transitivity of parthood:  
- z is part of y, and y is part of x, so z is part of x.  

Now, consider the boundary conditions:  
1. **Frooblenap(x,z)**: Occurs if x = y = z (all coincident).  
   - This satisfies both Narpulate conditions trivially.  
2. **Narpulate(x,z)**: Equivalent to Glimberish(z,x), meaning z is part of x and touches x's boundary.  
   - This occurs if the part of y that z touches is also on the boundary of x.  
3. **Zindlequack(x,z)**: Equivalent to Crindlewop(z,x), meaning z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.  
   - This occurs if z touches a part of y's boundary that is interior to x (not on x's boundary).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:  
- Frooblenap (if x = z),  
- Narpulate (if z is on x's boundary),  
- Zindlequack (if z is not on x's boundary).  

### Answer:  
Frooblenap, Narpulate, Zindlequack
