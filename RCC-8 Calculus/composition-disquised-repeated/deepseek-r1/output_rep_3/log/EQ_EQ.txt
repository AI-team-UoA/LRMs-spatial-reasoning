PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that Frooblenap(x,y) means x and y are coincident (occupy the same spatial region), and Frooblenap(y,z) means y and z are coincident, it follows that x and z must also be coincident due to the transitive nature of coincidence. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is Frooblenap(x,z).  

### Answer: Frooblenap(x,z)
