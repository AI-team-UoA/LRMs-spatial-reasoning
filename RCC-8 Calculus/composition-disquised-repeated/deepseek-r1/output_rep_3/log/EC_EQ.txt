PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that Snarfloon(x,y) holds, x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Given that Frooblenap(y,z) holds, y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy the same spatial extent.

Since y and z are coincident, any spatial relation between x and y must also hold between x and z. Specifically, because Snarfloon(x,y) describes a relationship where x and y touch at a boundary with no shared interior parts, and z is spatially identical to y, it follows that x and z also touch at the same boundary with no shared interior parts. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is Snarfloon(x,z).

No other spatial relations are possible because the relations are pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive, and the coincidence of y and z ensures that the relation between x and z is identical to that between x and y.

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z)
