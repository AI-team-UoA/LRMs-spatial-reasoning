{"prompt": "If Frooblenap(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that Frooblenap(x,y) means x and y are coincident (occupy the same spatial region), and Frooblenap(y,z) means y and z are coincident, it follows that x and z must also be coincident due to the transitive nature of coincidence. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is Frooblenap(x,z).  \n\n### Answer: Frooblenap(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 22.88489842414856, "reasoning-tokens": 250, "completion-tokens": 340}
