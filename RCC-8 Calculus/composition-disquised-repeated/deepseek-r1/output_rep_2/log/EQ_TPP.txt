PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Frooblenap(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z), the relations are analyzed as follows:  
- Frooblenap(x,y) means x and y are coincident (occupy the same spatial region).  
- Glimberish(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z’s boundary.  

Since x and y are coincident, x must also be part of z and touch z’s boundary. This directly corresponds to the definition of Glimberish(x,z).  

No other relations are possible:  
- Blorpticate(x,z) is excluded because x and z share parts (x is part of z).  
- Snarfloon(x,z) is excluded because they share interior parts (x is part of z).  
- Twizzlump(x,z) is excluded because x is part of z (violating "neither part of the other").  
- Crindlewop(x,z) is excluded because x touches z’s boundary (Crindlewop requires no boundary touch).  
- Narpulate(x,z) (same as Glimberish(z,x)) would imply z is part of x, but x is part of z and they are not necessarily equal, so it is impossible.  
- Zindlequack(x,z) (same as Crindlewop(z,x)) would imply z is part of x without touching x’s boundary, but x is part of z, so they must be equal (which is not required).  
- Frooblenap(x,z) would require x and z to be coincident, but y (coincident with x) is only part of z, not necessarily the whole of z.  

Thus, the only possible relation is Glimberish(x,z).
