PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Zindlequack(x,y), which means Crindlewop(y,x), so y is part of x and y does not touch x's boundary.  
Given Frooblenap(y,z), which means y and z are coincident (i.e., identical in spatial extent).  

Since y and z are coincident, z inherits all spatial properties of y. Therefore, z is part of x and z does not touch x's boundary. This corresponds to Crindlewop(z,x), or equivalently, Zindlequack(x,z).  

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is Zindlequack(x,z).  

### Answer:  
Zindlequack(x,z)
