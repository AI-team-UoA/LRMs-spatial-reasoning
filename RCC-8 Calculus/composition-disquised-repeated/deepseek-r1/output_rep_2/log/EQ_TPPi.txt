PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- Frooblenap(x,y) means x and y are coincident (same spatial extent).
- Narpulate(y,z) is defined as Glimberish(z,y), meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since Frooblenap(x,y) holds, x and y are coincident. Therefore, any spatial relation involving y can be equivalently considered with x. Thus, Narpulate(y,z) implies Glimberish(z,y), which, by substitution, becomes Glimberish(z,x) (because x and y are coincident).

Glimberish(z,x) means:
- z is part of x.
- z touches the boundary of x.

Now, consider the relation from x to z:
- If z is coincident with x (i.e., z is the whole of x), then Frooblenap(x,z) holds.
- If z is a proper part of x (i.e., not the whole) and still touches the boundary of x, then Narpulate(x,z) holds (since Narpulate(x,z) is defined as Glimberish(z,x)).

Both scenarios are possible under the given conditions:
- Coincidence (Frooblenap) is consistent with z being part of x and touching the boundary (since coincidence implies each is part of the other and shares the boundary).
- Narpulate specifically covers the case where z is part of x (but not the whole) and touches the boundary.

The relations are mutually exclusive, so only one can hold for a given pair. However, without additional constraints, both Frooblenap(x,z) and Narpulate(x,z) are possible.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are Frooblenap and Narpulate.

### Answer: Frooblenap(x,z) and Narpulate(x,z)
