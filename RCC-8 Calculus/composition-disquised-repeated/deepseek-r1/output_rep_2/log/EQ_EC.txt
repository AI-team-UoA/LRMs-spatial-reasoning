PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that Frooblenap(x,y) means x and y are coincident (i.e., they occupy the same spatial region), and Snarfloon(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts, the spatial relation between x and z must be identical to that between y and z because x and y are spatially indistinguishable.

Therefore, Snarfloon(x,z) must hold, meaning x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. No other relations are possible, as the coincident nature of x and y ensures that the relation with z is unchanged.

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z)
