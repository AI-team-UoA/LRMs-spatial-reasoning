{"prompt": "If Frooblenap(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y are coincident (Frooblenap(x,y)) and y is part of z, touching z\u2019s boundary (Glimberish(y,z)), then x = y is likewise part of z and touches z\u2019s boundary. Thus the only possible relation is Glimberish(x,z).  \n\n### Answer: Glimberish(x,z)  ", "elapsed-time": 15.631693601608276, "reasoning-tokens": 1728, "completion-tokens": 1851}
