{"prompt": "If Glimberish(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If y and z are coincident (Frooblenap(y,z)), then y and z occupy exactly the same region (including boundary). Since x is part of y and touches y\u2019s boundary (Glimberish(x,y)), it follows that x is also part of z and touches z\u2019s boundary. Hence the only possible relationship between x and z is Glimberish(x,z).\n\n### Answer: Glimberish(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 23.56308078765869, "reasoning-tokens": 2304, "completion-tokens": 2434}
