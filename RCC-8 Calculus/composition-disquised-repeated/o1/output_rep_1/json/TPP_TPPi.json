{"prompt": "If Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Glimberish(x,y) tells us x is part of y and touches y\u2019s boundary; Narpulate(y,z) is the same as Glimberish(z,y), so z is also part of y and touches y\u2019s boundary.  Under these conditions, x and z can still be arranged in many ways inside y (from disjoint to overlapping to identical), but neither can lie entirely in the interior of the other (that would force one of them not to reach y\u2019s boundary).  Consequently, the only impossible relations are the \u201ccompletely interior\u201d ones Crindlewop and Zindlequack.
