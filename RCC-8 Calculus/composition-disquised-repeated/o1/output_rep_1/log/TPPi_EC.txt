PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is part of x and touches x’s boundary (Narpulate(x,y)) and y merely touches z without sharing interior (Snarfloon(y,z)), then x and z must at least share the boundary point(s) that y and z share (because y ⊆ x). Hence they cannot be completely disjoint (Blorpticate), nor can x be part of z (Glimberish or Crindlewop) because that would force y ⊆ z, contradicting Snarfloon(y,z). Likewise, x and z cannot coincide (Frooblenap) because y ⊆ x would imply an interior overlap of y and z. The remaining possibilities—each of which can be arranged consistently—are that x and z merely touch (Snarfloon), overlap in the interior (Twizzlump), contain z so that it does or does not meet x’s boundary (Narpulate or Zindlequack, respectively). 

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
