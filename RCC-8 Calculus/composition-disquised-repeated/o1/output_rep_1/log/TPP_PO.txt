PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is part of y (and touches y’s boundary) while y and z partially overlap (neither is part of the other), then x could lie entirely outside z, could just touch z, could partially overlap z, or could lie entirely inside z (touching or not touching z’s boundary). Concretely, the possible relations are:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)  

No other relations can hold under these conditions.

### Answer:
Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, or Crindlewop.
