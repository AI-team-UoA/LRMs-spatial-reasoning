PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given Twizzlump(x,y), x and y overlap but neither contains the other. Also given Blorpticate(y,z), y and z share no parts. From this, x could either (1) be entirely disjoint from z, (2) merely touch z’s boundary, (3) partially overlap with z, or (4) contain z (with or without boundary contact). However, x cannot be contained in z (that would force y to overlap z), nor be coincident with z. Thus, the possible relations are:  
• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
