PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y coincide (Frooblenap(x,y)) and z is a proper part of y touching y’s boundary (Narpulate(y,z)), then, because x and y are the same region, z is also a proper part of x touching x’s boundary. That is precisely Narpulate(x,z). No other relation is possible.

### Answer:
Narpulate(x,z).
