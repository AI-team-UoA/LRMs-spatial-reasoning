PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Narpulate(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z), then by definition y is part of x (touching x’s boundary) and y is also part of z (not touching z’s boundary). This forces x and z to share at least the “y” region in their interiors, ruling out both disconnection (Blorpticate) and mere boundary contact (Snarfloon). It also cannot be that z is part of x, because then y (contained in z) could not reach x’s boundary without also touching z’s boundary. Consequently, the only remaining possibilities are:

• Twizzlump(x,z) — x and z overlap in their interiors without one being part of the other.  
• Glimberish(x,z) — x is part of z and touches z’s boundary.  
• Crindlewop(x,z) — x is part of z and does not touch z’s boundary.  

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).
