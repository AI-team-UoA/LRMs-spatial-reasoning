PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Because Zindlequack(x,y) = Crindlewop(y,x), we know that y is strictly inside x (no boundary contact), and Crindlewop(y,z) says that y is strictly inside z (again, no boundary contact). Hence y lies in the interior of both x and z. This immediately rules out Blorpticate(x,z) (disjoint) and Snarfloon(x,z) (only touching at a boundary), because in both of those cases x and z would share no interior points. All other relations remain possible, namely:

• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  
• Frooblenap(x,z)  

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z), or Frooblenap(x,z).
