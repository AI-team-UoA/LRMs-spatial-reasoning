PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x merely touches y (Snarfloon) while y and z overlap non‐containment‐wise (Twizzlump), then from x’s point of view, z could lie entirely away from x, just graze x’s boundary, partially overlap x, or even contain x. Concretely, the only impossible cases are the ones requiring that z be wholly inside x (which would force y to lie partly in x, contradicting Snarfloon(x,y)), or that x and z be identical. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)

### Answer: Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, or Crindlewop.
