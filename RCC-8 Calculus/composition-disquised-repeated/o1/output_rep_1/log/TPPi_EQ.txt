PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Narpulate(x,y) means that y is part of x (with boundary contact), and Frooblenap(y,z) means y and z are coincident (the same region). Hence z also is part of x with boundary contact. In other words, the only possible relation is Narpulate(x,z). 

### Answer: Narpulate(x,z)
