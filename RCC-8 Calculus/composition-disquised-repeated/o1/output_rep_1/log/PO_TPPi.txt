PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x overlaps y (Twizzlump(x,y)) but neither contains the other, and y contains z on its boundary (Narpulate(y,z) means z is part of y, touching y’s boundary), then between x and z all of the following remain possible:

• They could lie completely disjoint (Blorpticate(x,z)).  
• They could touch only at a boundary (Snarfloon(x,z)).  
• They could partially overlap without either containing the other (Twizzlump(x,z)).  
• z could lie wholly inside x but also touch x’s boundary (Narpulate(x,z)).  
• z could lie wholly inside x but not touch x’s boundary (Zindlequack(x,z)).  

Relations in which x is part of z (Glimberish or Crindlewop) or x and z coincide (Frooblenap) are ruled out by the given assumptions.

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
