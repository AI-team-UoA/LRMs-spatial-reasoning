PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Twizzlump(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Narpulate(x,y), then y is part of x and touches x’s boundary. Twizzlump(y,z) means y and z share an interior overlap but neither is contained in the other. Because y ⊆ x, any overlap y has with z sits inside x, so x and z must also share an interior overlap. This rules out their being disjoint (Blorpticate) or mere boundary‐touching (Snarfloon). Furthermore, x cannot be contained in z (which would make y ⊆ z, contradicting Twizzlump(y,z)), so Glimberish and Crindlewop of x with z are impossible. Finally, x and z cannot coincide (Frooblenap) because y is properly contained in x.

Thus the only remaining possibilities are:

• Twizzlump(x,z), if x and z overlap in a region but neither contains the other.  
• Narpulate(x,z), if z is part of x and touches x’s boundary.  
• Zindlequack(x,z), if z is part of x but does not touch x’s boundary.

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
