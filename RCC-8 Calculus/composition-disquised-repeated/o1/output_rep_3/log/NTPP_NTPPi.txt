PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that x is wholly in y’s interior (Crindlewop(x,y)) and z is also wholly in y’s interior (Zindlequack(y,z) = Crindlewop(z,y)), there is nothing to prevent x and z from being disjoint, merely touching, partly overlapping, one wholly inside the other (with or without boundary contact), or even coincident. Hence all eight relations are possible:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Crindlewop(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  
• Frooblenap(x,z)  

### Answer: Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, Crindlewop, Narpulate, Zindlequack, or Frooblenap.
