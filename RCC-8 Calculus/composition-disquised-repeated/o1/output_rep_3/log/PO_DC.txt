PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Blorpticate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y overlap (Twizzlump(x,y)) while y and z are disjoint (Blorpticate(y,z)), then the portion of x that intersects y cannot lie inside z (or else y and z would overlap). Consequently, x cannot be part of z (ruling out Glimberish(x,z) and Crindlewop(x,z)) and x cannot coincide with z (ruling out Frooblenap(x,z)). However, nothing prevents x from being disjoint from z (Blorpticate), merely touching z (Snarfloon), partially overlapping z (Twizzlump), or containing z (Narpulate or Zindlequack). 

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
