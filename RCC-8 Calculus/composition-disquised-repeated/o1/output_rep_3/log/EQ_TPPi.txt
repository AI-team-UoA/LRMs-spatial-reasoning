PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y coincide (Frooblenap(x,y)) and y is a tangential part of z in the sense Glimberish(z,y) (which is Narpulate(y,z)), then because x = y it follows that z is a tangential part of x.  In the given terminology, saying “z is a tangential part of x” is exactly TPP(z,x), whose inverse relation TPPi(x,z) is called Narpulate(x,z).  Hence the only possible relation between x and z is Narpulate(x,z).

### Answer: Narpulate(x,z)
