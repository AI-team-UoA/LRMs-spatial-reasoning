PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Glimberish(x,y) (x is part of y and touches y’s boundary) and Narpulate(y,z) (equivalently Glimberish(z,y), so z is part of y and touches y’s boundary), then x and z are both boundary‐touching parts of y. The only relations ruled out are those requiring one part to lie strictly in the interior of the other (without touching its boundary). Specifically, Crindlewop(x,z) and Zindlequack(x,z) (which mean “x (respectively z) is part of z (respectively x) but does not touch its boundary”) become impossible. All the other six relations remain possible:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Frooblenap(x,z)  

### Answer: Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Frooblenap.
