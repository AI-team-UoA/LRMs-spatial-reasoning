PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Zindlequack(x,y), then y is strictly inside x (y is part of x without touching xâ€™s boundary). If Zindlequack(y,z), then z is strictly inside y. Consequently, z is also strictly inside x, with no boundary contact. In the given terminology, that means Zindlequack(x,z). 

### Answer: Zindlequack(x,z).
