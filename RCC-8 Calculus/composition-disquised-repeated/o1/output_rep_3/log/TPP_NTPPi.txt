PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that Glimberish(x,y) says “x is part of y and touches y’s boundary,” x necessarily includes some of y’s boundary. Meanwhile, Zindlequack(y,z) means “z is part of y but does not touch y’s boundary,” so z sits wholly in y’s interior (no boundary contact).

From these two facts alone, x could be just a thin region near y’s boundary or could extend far into y’s interior; likewise, z is strictly in the interior of y. Consequently, the following are all consistent possibilities for the pair (x,z):

• Blorpticate(x,z): They may be wholly disjoint.  
• Snarfloon(x,z): They may only share a boundary (within y’s interior) but no interior points.  
• Twizzlump(x,z): They may overlap in the interior (share some interior region), yet neither is contained in the other.  
• Narpulate(x,z) (i.e. Glimberish(z,x)): z may be part of x and touch x’s boundary.  
• Zindlequack(x,z) (i.e. Crindlewop(z,x)): z may be part of x without touching x’s boundary.

Relations in which x would lie inside z (Glimberish(x,z), Crindlewop(x,z)) or coincide exactly (Frooblenap(x,z)) are not possible, because x touches y’s boundary while z does not. Hence the complete list of possible relations between x and z is:

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
