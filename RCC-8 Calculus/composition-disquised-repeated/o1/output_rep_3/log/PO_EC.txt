PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y overlap (Twizzlump(x,y)), but y only touches z at a boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)), then x and z can still be arranged in several different ways without forcing y and z to share any interior.  In particular:

• x and z might be completely disjoint (Blorpticate(x,z)).  
• x and z might touch only at a boundary (Snarfloon(x,z)).  
• x and z might share an overlapping region (Twizzlump(x,z)).  
• z might be wholly contained in x and touch x’s boundary (Narpulate(x,z)).  
• z might be wholly contained in x and not touch x’s boundary (Zindlequack(x,z)).  

### Answer:  
Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
