PROMPT: If Glimberish(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Glimberish(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y’s boundary, and Frooblenap(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, then y and z share the same boundary. Consequently, x remains a part of z that touches its boundary—unless x is exactly the same region as y, in which case x coincides with z as well. Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are Glimberish(x,z) or Frooblenap(x,z).

### Answer: Glimberish(x,z) or Frooblenap(x,z)
