PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Snarfloon(x,y) places x outside y except for a shared boundary (no interior overlap), while Zindlequack(y,z) (i.e. “z is part of y but does not touch y’s boundary”) places z entirely in y’s interior. Consequently, x and z cannot meet at all (they are separated by y), so the only possible relation is Blorpticate(x,z).

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z).
