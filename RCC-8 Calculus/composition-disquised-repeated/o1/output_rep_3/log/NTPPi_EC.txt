PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is wholly in the interior of x (Zindlequack(x,y)) yet just touches z at a boundary (Snarfloon(y,z)), that boundary‐contact point must lie inside x.  Consequently, x and z cannot be completely disjoint (Blorpticate), nor can x coincide with z (Frooblenap), nor can x be part of z (Glimberish/Crindlewop).  What remains possible is that z might lie entirely within x (either touching x’s boundary: Narpulate(x,z), or not: Zindlequack(x,z)), or that x and z share an overlapping interior without either being wholly inside the other (Twizzlump(x,z)), or else they only meet at z’s boundary inside x (Snarfloon(x,z)).  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:

• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z).
