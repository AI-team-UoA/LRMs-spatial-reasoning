PROMPT: If Snarfloon(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and z coincide (Frooblenap(y,z)), then, from x’s perspective, y and z are the same region. Therefore, if x Snarfloon’s y (they share only a boundary but no interior), x must similarly Snarfloon z. No other relation is possible.

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z)
