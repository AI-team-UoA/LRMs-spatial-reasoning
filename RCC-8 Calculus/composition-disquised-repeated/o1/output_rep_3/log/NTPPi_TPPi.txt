PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If Zindlequack(x,y), then y is part of x and does not touch x’s boundary.  
If Narpulate(y,z), then z is part of y and does touch y’s boundary.  

Putting these together, z lies entirely within y, and y in turn lies entirely (and strictly) within x. Because y does not approach x’s boundary, z (being part of y) also cannot approach x’s boundary. Therefore, z is part of x but does not touch x’s boundary. By definition, that is exactly Zindlequack(x,z).

### Answer: Zindlequack(x,z)
