PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is “Zindlequack(x,y),” then y is wholly in the interior of x (no boundary contact with x). If y is also “Glimberish(y,z),” then y is part of z and does meet z’s boundary. The only ways for y to be fully inside x yet still touch z’s boundary are:  
• z is strictly contained in x (so from x’s perspective, Zindlequack(x,z)) and y sits inside z touching z’s boundary, or  
• x and z merely overlap in an interior region (so Twizzlump(x,z)) and y is in that region touching z’s boundary.  

No other containment or boundary‐touching configurations can accommodate y’s being interior to x but on z’s boundary.  

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z) or Zindlequack(x,z).
