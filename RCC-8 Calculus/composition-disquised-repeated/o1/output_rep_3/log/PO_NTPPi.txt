PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Zindlequack(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y Twizzlump (i.e., they share interior but neither is part of the other) while y fully contains z in its interior (Zindlequack(y,z) means z is part of y with no boundary contact), then z could lie in a portion of y that x does not intersect (making x and z disjoint), or z could lie partly or wholly within the region of y intersected by x. Consequently, the following five relations between x and z are all consistent with those premises:

• Blorpticate(x,z)  
• Snarfloon(x,z)  
• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Narpulate(x,z)  
• Zindlequack(x,z)  

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), Zindlequack(x,z).
