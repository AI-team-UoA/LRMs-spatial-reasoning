PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Crindlewop(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is wholly in the interior of y, and y is wholly in the interior of z, then x must also be wholly in the interior of z (and not touching zâ€™s boundary). The only relation consistent with that is Crindlewop(x,z). 

### Answer: Crindlewop(x,z)
