{"prompt": "If Frooblenap(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y coincide (Frooblenap(x,y)) and y is a tangential part of z in the sense Glimberish(z,y) (which is Narpulate(y,z)), then because x = y it follows that z is a tangential part of x.  In the given terminology, saying \u201cz is a tangential part of x\u201d is exactly TPP(z,x), whose inverse relation TPPi(x,z) is called Narpulate(x,z).  Hence the only possible relation between x and z is Narpulate(x,z).\n\n### Answer: Narpulate(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 68.37638282775879, "reasoning-tokens": 5760, "completion-tokens": 5939}
