PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Zindlequack(x,y) means y is part of x but does not touch x’s boundary. Narpulate(y,z) means z is part of y and does touch y’s boundary. Because y is wholly in the interior of x (no boundary contact) and z is wholly contained in y, z is also in the interior of x (so z cannot touch x’s boundary). Therefore, z is likewise part of x without boundary contact. That corresponds exactly to Zindlequack(x,z). No other relation is possible.  

### Answer: Zindlequack(x,z).
