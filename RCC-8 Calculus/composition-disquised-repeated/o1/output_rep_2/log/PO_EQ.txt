PROMPT: If Twizzlump(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and z are coincident, then any spatial sharing or non‚Äêsharing that holds between x and y will hold in exactly the same way between x and z. Since x and y share an interior part but neither is part of the other (Twizzlump), it follows that x and z share that same interior region but neither is part of the other. 

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z)
