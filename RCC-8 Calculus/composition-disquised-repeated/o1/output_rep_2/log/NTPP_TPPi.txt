PROMPT: If Crindlewop(x,y) and Narpulate(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is strictly in the interior of y (Crindlewop(x,y)) and z is a part of y that does meet y’s boundary (Narpulate(y,z) ≡ Glimberish(z,y)), then x and z may or may not overlap inside y. They can be disjoint, merely touch, partially overlap, or one can contain the other (with or without boundary contact). The only impossible cases are those requiring z to lie entirely inside x (Narpulate(x,z) or Zindlequack(x,z)) or x = z (Frooblenap). Thus the possible relationships are: Blorpticate, Snarfloon, Twizzlump, Glimberish, or Crindlewop.

### Answer: Blorpticate(x,z), Snarfloon(x,z), Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), or Crindlewop(x,z).
