PROMPT: If Zindlequack(x,y) and Glimberish(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “Zindlequack(x,y)” means y is strictly inside x (y is part of x but does not meet x’s boundary), while “Glimberish(y,z)” means y is inside z but does meet z’s boundary.  Intuitively, y sits wholly in the interior of x, yet y’s boundary also coincides with part of z’s boundary.  That forces some portion of z’s boundary to lie strictly inside x, so x and z must share interior points (namely y) but in a way that still allows y to reach z’s boundary from inside x.

A standard region‐based (RCC‐like) analysis shows that the only consistent possibilities are that x and z either (i) partially overlap in their interiors (neither is contained in the other), or else one of them is contained in the other in such a way that their boundaries may or may not coincide.  Translated back into the eight relations given, the possible relationships between x and z are:

• Twizzlump(x,z)  
• Glimberish(x,z)          (x is part of z and touches z’s boundary)  
• Narpulate(x,z) = Glimberish(z,x)  (z is part of x and touches x’s boundary)  
• Zindlequack(x,z) = Crindlewop(z,x) (z is strictly inside x)

Hence the answer is:

### Answer: Twizzlump(x,z), Glimberish(x,z), Narpulate(x,z), or Zindlequack(x,z).
