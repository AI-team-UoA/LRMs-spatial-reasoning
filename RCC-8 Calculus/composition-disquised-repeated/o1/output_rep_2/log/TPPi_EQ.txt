PROMPT: If Narpulate(x,y) and Frooblenap(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From Narpulate(x,y) we know that y is a proper part of x that touches x’s boundary. Frooblenap(y,z) says that y and z coincide (are the same region). Substituting z for y, we conclude that z is also a proper part of x touching x’s boundary. By definition, that relationship is exactly Narpulate(x,z). No other relation is possible under these constraints.

### Answer: Narpulate(x,z)
