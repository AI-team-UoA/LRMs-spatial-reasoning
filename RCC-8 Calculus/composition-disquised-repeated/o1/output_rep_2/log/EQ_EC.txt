PROMPT: If Frooblenap(x,y) and Snarfloon(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are coincident (Frooblenap(x,y)), then x and y occupy exactly the same region. So, given Snarfloon(y,z) (y and z share only a boundary and no interior), x and z must likewise share that very same boundary (and no interior), because x = y. Thus, the only consistent possibility is Snarfloon(x,z).

### Answer: Snarfloon(x,z)
